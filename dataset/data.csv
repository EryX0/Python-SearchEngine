The chain is making a The permanent sides, called Subway Sidekicks, will be available across the US beginning January 22. Prices will vary depending on market, but the suggested price for the churro is $2, the pretzel is $3 and $5 for the cookie. Sidekicks marks a whole new menu category for Subway, best known for their sandwiches. The additions come from customers demanding more from the menu, according to Douglas Fry, Subway's North America president. ""We've done that because we've gotten feedback from our guests because they can come in and grab their favorite sandwich, but they wanted some other reasons to come in,"" Fry told CNN. ""Grazing and snacking is on the rise, especially with our core consumers."" Another benefit for Subway, Value was also a factor in launching Sidekicks, Fry said. ""These footlong snacks come in at a great price. We're going to see some great lift and excitement from college campuses ... which, at the end of the day, is what we're chasing after as we evolve the Subway brand."" The addition of Sidekicks ""makes sense,"" said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic, telling CNN that Subway needs to increase revenue somewhere since fast food customers have begun pushing back on price increases amid inflation. ""They've underperformed in the sandwich segment, so they need to shake things up a little bit and drive some incremental traffic,"" Henkes said. Technomic data shows that Subway also lags in sales for sides and snacks compared to its competitors. Saving Subway The chain has undergone a makeover in basically all aspects of its business having struggled in recent years as competition has ramped up and as the nearly 60-year-old brand has fallen out of favor with customers. As part of its turnaround effort, the company added The fixes have largely worked, although the privately held company doesn't regularly release financial reports. Most recently, in July 2023, the company announced its 10th consecutive quarter of positive sales at stores open at least a year, including a 9.5% increase at its North America locations (it didn't reveal specific numbers). Despite the sales turnaround, the number of US Subway stores declined to 20,576 in 2022 according to Technomic. That's a sharp decrease from its peak in 2015 when it had 27,219 locations.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/10/tech/meta-match-walmart-ads-disturbing-content-lawsuit/index.html,"CNN Meta advertisers, including dating app company Match Group and Walmart, have raised concerns to the tech giant about their ads appearing alongside disturbing sexual content, New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez alleged in an updated complaint in his lawsuit against the tech giant. The updated complaint, filed Wednesday in New Mexico district court, comes after Torrez sued Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month, Wednesday's filing alleges that Match Group cut its advertising spending on Meta's platforms over its concerns. The claims that advertisers have raised such concerns to Meta -- and that Match cut its spending -- marks a ""We don't want this kind of content on our platforms and brands don't want their ads to appear next to it,"" Meta said in a statement from spokesperson Andy Stone. ""We continue to invest aggressively to stop it -- and report every quarter on the prevalence of such content, which remains very low. Our systems are effective at reducing violating content, and we've invested billions in safety, security and brand suitability solutions."" Walmart said in a statement to CNN that it takes ""brand safety issues extremely seriously, and protecting our customers and communities will always be a top priority."" Match Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wednesday's complaint cites an alleged email exchange between Match and Meta late last year in which the dating company asked how Meta prevented its ads from running next to inappropriate content. Meta tells advertisers that its technology prevents ads from appearing next to content that is ""excessively controversial or offensive, such as full nudity, excessive violence, terrorist acts, or misinformation,"" and by touting its additional ""brand suitability controls"" available to advertisers, the complaint states. However, Match informed Meta that its ads had run alongside a series of Instagram Reels videos showing ""young girls, including a '[y]oung girl provocatively dressed, straddling and caressing a Harley Davidson-style motorcycle,'"" as well as next to a Facebook group ""showing films of women being murdered,"" according to the complaint. Meta responded saying it had removed some of the flagged content, including the group, the complaint states. Match Group's CEO also allegedly reached out directly to Zuckerberg to note that ""Meta is placing ads adjacent to offensive, obscene - and potentially illegal - content, including sexualization of minors and gender-based violence,"" and said that Match had cut its advertising spending on Meta's platforms. Zuckerberg has not yet responded to the message, the complaint states. Walmart also repeatedly raised concerns to Meta last year about where its ads were being shown, including following a November report by The Wall Street Journal indicating that an advertisement for the retailer was shown after an explicit video of a woman, the complaint alleges. ""It is extremely disappointing that this type of content exists on Meta, and it is unacceptable for Walmart's brand to appear anywhere near it,"" the company said in an email to Meta, according to the complaint. Meta moved to dismiss the New Mexico lawsuit last month, arguing the complaint failed to state a claim. The tech giant also cited its protections under a law known as Growing scrutiny of youth safety The New Mexico lawsuit is part of growing pressure on Meta to address alleged harm to young users of Facebook and Instagram. The social media giant has been sued by various Meta has strongly and repeatedly denied claims that its platforms put children at risk. The company on Wednesday announced new youth safety efforts, including content restrictions and new blocked search terms, that add to its existing slate of more than 30 Still, Torrez claims the company is not doing enough to protect young users. ""Mr. Zuckerberg and Meta are refusing to be honest and transparent about what is taking place on Meta's platforms,"" Torrez said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. ""New Mexico's complaint alleges that, for years, they have misled the public about children's inappropriate and dangerous experiences on Facebook and Instagram."" Allegations of child predators using Facebook Wednesday's complaint also alleges that Meta executives have for years known that child predators were using Facebook to groom victims and failed to act. It claims that as far back as 2018, Facebook employees raised alarms to senior executives that the platform was aiding child predators in connecting with children and suggested solutions to address the issue that were rejected. In particular, the ""People You May Know"" feature was responsible for suggesting to adult users the accounts of children that matched search terms they'd previously used, such as ""children in their geographic area,"" the complaint alleges. In a Wall Street Journal report about the issue in December, Meta's Stone The complaint also alleges that ""Forums on the dark web devoted to child sex abuse ... show open conversations about the role of Instagram's and Facebook's algorithms in delivering children to predators."" In one instance viewed by the attorney general's investigators, one participant in the chat forum discussed having been followed by a 10-year-old girl on Instagram and said they were considering sending her a direct message. ""Do you think I'm getting in trouble,"" the participant asked on the forum, according to the complaint. Another participant responded, ""you see how the baby reacts! On Instagram it is very easy to just ask for a couple of intimate photos and then send your own and if you like each other go to a meeting in a cozy place,"" the complaint states. The new claims come as Zuckerberg is set to testify later this month at a Senate subcommittee hearing on youth safety online, alongside representatives from TikTok, Snapchat, Discord and X.","Ads for Match Group and Walmart ran alongside disturbing content on Meta's platforms, court documents claim"

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/10/tech/federal-judge-pauses-ohio-social-media-law/index.html,"CNN An Ohio law regulating kids' accounts on social media likely violates the First Amendment in ""breathtakingly blunt"" ways and cannot take effect next week as scheduled, a federal judge has ruled. The state law set to take effect Jan. 15 would have required social media platforms to obtain parental consent before creating accounts for children under  age 16. The decision to pause the law while litigation continues marks another early-stage victory for the tech industry against a wave of state social media laws seeking to govern how tech companies engage with young users. Those laws have emerged as a response to nationwide concerns about the possible link between social media use and harms to mental health, particularly for minors. In Tuesday's emergency order temporarily blocking the law, Algenon Marbley, chief judge at the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, sided with tech industry arguments about Ohio's Parental Notification by Social Media Operators Act. Marbley expressed doubts about Ohio's ability to prove in court that the law can survive First Amendment scrutiny, writing that the legislation's approach ""is an untargeted one, as parents must only give one-time approval for the creation of an account,"" and doesn't otherwise require platforms to ""protect against any of the specific dangers that social media might pose."" Challenging the law is a tech industry group, NetChoice, whose members include Instagram-parent Meta, Google, TikTok and Snapchat-parent Snap, among others. NetChoice had argued that Ohio's law infringes on the First Amendment rights of social media companies and underage Ohioans alike.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/12/business/electric-car-regulations-response/index.html,"CNN The US government is planning to Without these requirements, electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035, according to Moody's industry analyst Matthias Heck. The goals laid out by the EPA are manageable, he said, but it won't be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. For now, the proposal is still just that, a proposal, and could well change before before being finalized, Heck pointed out. Over the next decade things will change a lot, including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. Consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. And government incentives, like those under the new Inflation Reduction Act, will help, too. It's important to remember that, nearly a decade from now, electric vehicles are going to be different from what's on the market today, said Chris Harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. And even as EV market share rises to two-thirds, it's not like EVs will flood America's roads overnight, he said. Eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered, he said, but shopping for a new vehicle will be different. 'We're talking about past cost parity, so it's going to be the same price or cheaper,"" compared to a gas-powered car, he said. At the same time, driving ranges will increase, fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs, Harto said. Moody's Heck predicted that next-generation EV batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster. So when combined with improved charging networks - something else that can be expected over that time - electric cars won't be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price, Harto said. There will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. Today, there are ""EV equivalents"" available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models Americans can buy, according to Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at JD Power. Electric market share now stands at 8.5%. Krear did not specifically comment on the chances of EVs making up two-thirds of the US auto market by 2032. But by 2026, just three years from now, Krear expects there will be ""EV equivalents"" for 75% of the vehicles Americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. In California, where EVs are more popular and there are more models available, EV market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032. California plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035, a goal it's on the way to meeting, according to Corey Cantor, an analyst with Bloomberg NEF. So California should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, by 2032 and California itself, through its sheer size, is a big factor in the overall US vehicle market. ""California's influence on the whole country Is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without California,"" he said. Reaching two-thirds EV market share mark by 2032 isn't a sure thing, said Cantor, but it should be manageable. The increasing number of automakers entering the EV market will also help, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand. ""Not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it's an EV or it has X-Y-Z piece of technology,"" said Drury. "" I think that when you have something like Toyota, definitely a loyal consumer base, they don't want anything other than Toyotas."" Currently, Toyota offers only one electric model in the United States, the  The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country, ""[A] lot has to go right for this massive - and unprecedented - change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed,"" the group wrote in its statement. At some point, various automakers that may have been slower than GM to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons, said Cantor.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/23/tech/iphone-thief-recovery-key/index.html,"CNN A complex but concerning method Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. It's important to note, however, this type of takeover is hard to pull off. It requires a criminal essentially watching an iPhone user enter the device's passcode - for example, by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event - or manipulating the device's owner so they'll share their passcode. And that's all before they physically steal the device. From there, a thief could use Apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an Apple ID in an effort to bolster the user's security, but if a thief changes it, the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account.

""We work tirelessly every day to protect our users' accounts and data, and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one."" On its website, Apple Jeff Pollard, VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said the company should offer more customer support options and ""ways for Apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings."" For now, however, there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them. Protect the passcode The first step is protecting the passcode. An Apple spokesperson told CNN people can use Face ID or Touch ID when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching. Users can also set up a longer, alphanumeric passcode that's harder for bad actors to figure out. Device owners Screen Time settings Another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by Apple but one that's been circulating online. Within an iPhone's Screen Time setting, which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device, there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they could By enabling this, a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an Apple ID password. Back up phone regularly Finally, users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iPhone - via iCloud or iTunes - so data can be recovered in the case an iPhone is stolen. At the same time, users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service, such as Google Photos, Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Photos or Dropbox. This won't stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device, but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen.",How to protect yourself from iPhone thieves locking you out of your own device

In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company's stock.

""I should note that the Tesla board is great,"" Musk said in an Musk then said he put ""compensation plan"" in quotes because he is mainly concerned about the amount of ownership he holds. The Tesla CEO argued that he wields too little influence at the company and fears that asset managers that hold massive stakes in Tesla, such as Fidelity and BlackRock, could undermine his ability to transform the company if he sought to take it in a new direction. ""If I have 25%, it means I am influential, but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me,"" Musk wrote. ""At 15% or lower, the for/against ratio to override me makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy."" Many tech companies have a dual-class voting system, in which a founder or early leader like Musk has multiple votes for each share to maintain their outsized influence of the company. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, holds 61% of the voting power at Meta despite Vanguard, BlackRock and Fidelity owning more Meta stock than he does.

Apple estimated in 2022 that Apple generally takes a 30% cut of in-app purchases of digital goods and services, though it takes a lower 15% cut in some situations and the company has said many app makers pay no commission at all. The company for years has sought to prevent app makers from using buttons, links or other features within iOS apps to direct customers to purchase in-app content through payment channels other than Apple's. By not hearing Apple's petition, the Supreme Court leaves in place a nationwide injunction prohibiting Apple from intervening when developers include such features in their apps. It also highlights how a lawsuit At stake are the lucrative fees that Apple can charge when in-app transactions are processed through the iPhone-maker's proprietary payment channels. Apple's app store terms had included so-called ""anti-steering"" language asserting a right for the iPhone maker to block developers from adding features designed to circumvent Apple's payment system. The injunction takes aim at that language, barring Apple from enforcing it. That court order, first issued by a federal district court in Apple's Apple had argued that the order was unconstitutionally broad because it affected developers who were not involved in the Epic Games litigation.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/06/tech/new-mexico-lawsuit-meta-child-sexual-exploitation,"CNN New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez has accused Meta Platforms of creating a ""breeding ground"" for child predators on Facebook and Instagram in a lawsuit filed Tuesday, the latest in a string of legal actions related to alleged harms to young users caused by the social media giant. Meta allegedly exposes young users to sexual content and makes it possible for adult users they don't know to contact them, putting children at risk of abuse or exploitation, according to the complaint, filed in New Mexico state court. ""Meta's business model of profit over child safety and business practices of misrepresenting the amount of dangerous material and conduct to which its platforms expose children violates New Mexico law,"" the complaint, which also names Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as a defendant, states. ""Meta should be held accountable for the harms it has inflicted on New Mexico's children."" Meta has faced growing scrutiny over the impact of its platforms on young users in recent years. The social media giant has been sued by various The social media giant last month also Meta strongly denied claims that its platforms put children at risk. ""We use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and share information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators,"" Meta spokesperson Nkechi Nneji said in a statement, adding that Meta has removed hundreds of thousands of accounts, groups and devices for violating its child safety policies. The company said in a As part of its investigation, the attorney general's office created a number of sample Instagram accounts registered to minors as young as 12-years-old. Those accounts were able to search for and access explicit ""sexual or self-harm content,"" including ""soft-core pornography,"" the complaint states. New Mexico's investigation In one case, the complaint alleges, a search for porn was blocked on Facebook and returned no results, but the same search on Instagram yielded ""numerous accounts."" Photos of young girls posted to Instagram regularly produced ""a stream of comments from accounts of adult males, often with requests that the girls contact them or send pictures,"" the complaint alleges, adding that it identified adult accounts that followed multiple pages with photos of children. ""After viewing accounts that showed sexually suggestive pictures of girls, Instagram's algorithms directed investigators to other accounts with images of sexual intercourse and sexualized images of minors,"" the complaint states. Investigators identified dozens of accounts sharing sexualized images of children, including photos of young girls in lingerie and images suggesting that children were ""engaged in sexual activity,"" the complaint alleges. In some cases, such accounts appeared to be offering child sexual abuse material for sale, it claims. The lawsuit also alleges that Meta's safety measures are falling short, making it easier for people to find sexualized images of children. ""An Instagram search for Lolita, with literary roots connoting a relationship between an adult male and teenage girl, produced an Instagram warning flagging content related to potential child sexual abuse,"" the complaint states. ""However, the algorithm also suggested alternative terms like 'lolitta girls,' which yielded content without a warning.""

The blasts, at least one of which was caused by a bomb, state TV said, came on the fourth anniversary of Soleimani's death in a US airstrike, and threaten to accelerate tensions in the region that have spiked since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. At least 84 people were killed and 284 others injured, according to state-run news agency IRNA, citing Jafar Miadfar, No group has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the deadliest to hit Iran since the 1979 revolution. Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi blamed Israel for the explosions, saying it will pay a ""heavy price."" ""I warn the Zionist regime, do not doubt that you will pay a heavy price for this crime and the crimes you have committed,"" Raisi said in a televised speech from Tehran. Raisi, who is the head of the Iranian government, warned that Israel's punishment will be ""regrettable and severe."" The Israeli military told CNN it had ""no comment"" on the matter while the US State Department said it had no reason to believe Israel was involved.  ""I think it's just based on the MO it does look like a terrorist attack, the type of thing we've seen ISIS do in the past. And as far as we're aware, that's kind of I think our going assumption at the moment,"" the official said. Iran has suffered major Islamist terror attacks before. In 2022, at least 15 people were killed and 40 others injured in the The first explosion was 2,300 feet (700 meters) from Soleimani's grave, and the second was 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) away as pilgrims visited the site, IRNA reported. Soleimani was IRINN, another state television channel, reported that the first explosion near the grave of Soleimani was caused by a bomb placed in a suitcase inside a Peugeot 405 car, and appeared to be detonated remotely.

Vahidi said the second, more deadly blast took place 20 minutes later, when other pilgrims came to help the injured. Videos posted on Iranian state media showed large crowds running in the area after the explosion. Footage also showed bloodied bodies being transported from the scene, and ambulances leaving the site through large crowds. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Iran will have a ""harsh response.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/28/middleeast/israel-hamas-war-one-month-explainer-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas are The Israeli military began an offensive on the Palestinian enclave after Hamas militants launched a brutal assault on Israel on October 7 - the biggest terrorist attack in the country's history - with gunmen killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than Israel's retaliation The conflict has led to a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with more In response, aid groups, Arab states and the United Nations have repeatedly called Israel has so far shown no signs of scaling back its military operation, which is only widening, as it vows to eliminate Hamas once and for all. Here's what we know about the war. How did the conflict start? In an operation it called ""Al-Aqsa Storm,"" Hamas fired thousands of rockets towards Israeli towns on October 7, before breaking through the heavily fortified border fence with Israel and sending militants deep into Israeli territory. There, gunmen killed civilians and soldiers, and took more than 200 hostages, including dozens of foreign nationals. The attacks were unprecedented in tactics and scale, as Israel hasn't faced its adversaries on its own territory since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. It has also never faced a terror attack of this magnitude that took the lives of so many civilians. How did Israel react? Israel responded by launching ""Operation Swords of Iron,"" with the goal of eliminating Hamas. It imposed a complete siege on Gaza, blocking food, water and fuel from entering, and launched a ground offensive that saw its troops enter deep into the enclave and effectively split it in two. Amid the bombardment, Gaza residents were advised by Israel to evacuate their homes in the north and move southwards as troops sought to Human rights groups have said Israel's evacuation order What is Hamas? Hamas is an Hamas, like most Palestinian factions and political parties, says that Israel is an occupying power and that it is trying to liberate the Palestinian territories. It has over the years claimed many attacks on Israel and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Israel. Unlike some other Palestinian factions, Hamas refuses to engage with Israel and does not recognize its right to exist. In 1993, it opposed the Oslo Accords, a peace pact between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that saw the PLO give up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The Accords also established the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, and presents itself as an alternative to the PA. Israel occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005, when it unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers, but continued to exert control over the territory's sea, airspace and land crossings. The vast majority of Gaza's residents are descendants of refugees whose ancestors either fled or were forced out of their homes in what is now Israel. The enclave is one of the most densely populated places on earth. What is the situation in Gaza? Before the war, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade of Gaza that strictly controlled the movement of people and goods both into and out of the territory. But Israel has now imposed an even tighter siege, banning the entry of food, water and fuel, which the United Nations has said amounts to "" The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has said that more than 1.4 million people in Gaza are now internally displaced. More than half a million are seeking refuge in facilities run by the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which are accommodating numbers three times their intended capacity. Thousands of people are sheltering in hospitals and other civilian facilities, which health workers say have been targeted by Israel. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that it has documented at least 102 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza since October 7. Israel has said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the strip, and accused Hamas of Out of those who have been killed in the enclave, more than 4,100 are children, according to the Gazan health ministry. The enclave has been described by the UN as ""a graveyard for children."" What is the Rafah crossing? Israel has shut its two border crossings with Gaza. And with aid desperately needed, the only route for its entry into the territory is through Rafah is the sole border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, falling along an 8-mile (12.8-kilometer) fence that separates Gaza from the Sinai Peninsula. The crossing has been essential for the delivery of aid and evacuation of wounded Palestinians during previous wars with Israel. Following intense negotiations, the crossing was finally opened more than three weeks into the war, allowing a small number of wounded How has the international community reacted to the war? The US has largely supported Israel's operation in Gaza throughout the war, despite heavy criticism from some opponents at home and mass protests across the world calling for a ceasefire. Arab leaders have delivered strong messages to Israel, especially against what they perceive as plans to expel Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt, and those in the West Bank to Jordan. US President Joe Biden has said that it would be a Some of Hamas' allies in the region, such as Iran and Lebanon's powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, have also warned Israel and Washington against continued bombing of Gaza. Amid rising death tolls and an international outcry over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, however, the Biden administration What will it take for de-escalation? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Israel has accused Hamas of hoarding and diverting fuel. CNN cannot independently verify the amount of fuel in the enclave. Qatar, a US ally that maintains ties with Hamas, has been trying to mediate deals to free hostages, as well as evacuate foreign nationals from Gaza. Four hostages held by Hamas - two Israelis and two American-Israelis - have so far been freed through Qatari and Egyptian mediation. How likely is this war to escalate into a regional conflict? The Hamas attack raised concerns that the conflict could spread across the region, with the potential entry of Hezbollah from Lebanon as well as Israel's arch enemy Iran. The US has warned regional players against getting pulled into the war, The US military has  On Israel's northern border, Iran-backed Hezbollah has engaged in an exchange of fire since the Gaza war began.

The claim punctuates a tense few days of uncertainty as speculation mounted on whether Israel's war with Gaza would Here's what we know about the attacks in Kerman: What did ISIS say? ISIS media wing Al-Furqan issued a statement, titled ""And Kill Them Wherever You Find Them,"" on Thursday as they claimed responsibility for the twin blasts.

They also warned the ""polytheists"" that the ""mujahideen are lying in wait for them and their projects."" Islamic State considers the Shia branch of Islam to be heretical and has targeted shrines and religious sites in Iran previously. The group offered no further proof and their account of the blasts differs from that given by Iranian media. The death toll provided by ISIS was also significantly higher than that reported by Iranian officials. What are Iranian officials saying? The first explosion was caused by a bomb placed in a suitcase in a car, and appeared to be detonated remotely, Iranian state television reported. The second, more deadly blast took place 20 minutes later, when people came to help the injured. No one claimed responsibility for the attack for more than 24 hours, during which time Iranian officials were quick to blame Israel and said it will pay for it. On Wednesday, the Israeli military told CNN it had ""no comment"" on the explosions. Some Iranian figures were skeptical.

Iran has yet to respond to the ISIS claim as of Thursday but both Iran's official state news agency IRNA, as well as its English-language state media outlet Press TV, reported on ISIS's claim of responsibility. Does Iran have many adversaries? ISIS is one of several adversaries the Islamic Republic has aside from Israel. These includes Iranian opposition and separatist groups inside the country and out. It faces separatist movements in the Iran has also come under attack by ISIS and its affiliates several times in the past decade. Iran's most prominent exiled opposition group is the Ali Vaez, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, wrote on X that if Israel was behind the attack, it would be part of a campaign of maximum provocation ""to prompt Iran into committing a mistake that would justify expanding the war (with Hamas) and dragging the US in."" But he added that the attack didn't bear the hallmarks of an Israeli operation, but rather those of ISIS or Baluchi separatists. Past attacks that Iran has blamed on Israel have typically targeted individuals, rather than larger groups of people, or facilities tied to to the regime's nuclear program. Several nuclear scientists have died in targeted killings over the past decade. A senior White House official told reporters Wednesday that the blasts ""look like a terrorist attack.""

On Thursday, a Tehran had blamed Israel for the attack but it is unclear what the calculus is now that ISIS has claimed responsibility. Iran has reportedly plotted to kill Israelis in Europe and Asia in recent years in an effort to avenge Israel's alleged operations against it, but it has failed. Right-wing critics of the Iranian government deem those attempts as ""Iranian officials are confused and divided regarding the appropriate method of exacting revenge,"" Mazhari wrote ahead of the killing of Mousavi. ""Their relative inaction is in line with a policy of strategic patience that seeks to avoid a direct confrontation with the US or Israel."" Tehran is in an awkward position, said Vakil. ""Pointing the finger at terror groups will provide Iran with a way out of this pressure,"" she said. ""It can blame Israel and the US for stoking regional unrest, but blame IS to avoid taking action.""

""The killing and maiming of children is condemned as a grave violation against children, and perpetrators must be held to account,"" he said. Save the Children referenced remarks from UNICEF spokesperson James Elder, who after returning from Gaza, said on December 19 that around 1,000 children had lost one or both of their legs since October 7, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel and war broke out. The charity also cited a World Health Organization statement in which the agency said many of these operations on children were conducted without anesthesia, given the severe shortages in medical supplies and basic goods in Gaza. Lee said he had seen ""doctors and nurses completely overwhelmed"" when children are brought in with blast wounds. ""The impact of seeing children in that much pain and not having the equipment, medicines to treat them or alleviate pain is too much for even experienced professionals,"" he said. Children are nearly seven times more likely to die from blast injuries than adults as they are more vulnerable and sensitive to injuries, according to the charity. ""Their skulls are still not fully formed, and their undeveloped muscles offer less protection, so a blast is more likely to tear apart organs in their abdomen, even when there's no visible damage,"" Lee said, calling for a ""definitive ceasefire"" to allow the flow of humanitarian aid and medicines. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said it is not targeting civilians, and that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as shields for its attacks on Israel. At least 22,835 Palestinians have been killed and 58,416 others injured in Gaza since October 7, the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Sunday. CNN is not able to independently verify the numbers released by the ministry. Almost 90% of Gaza's more than 2 million population has been forcibly displaced due to Israel's war on Hamas, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. 'Deadly cycle' The UN's children's agency has also warned of Cases of diarrhea in children under age 5 increased about 2,000% compared to before the war, UNICEF said. ""The significant increase in cases in such a short timeframe is a strong indication that child health in the Gaza Strip is fast deteriorating,"" the agency said. And 90% of children under age 2 are now subject to ""severe food poverty,"" it said - up from 80% just two weeks earlier.

In a reversal that stunned many EU insiders, the German government decided to push for a loophole that would allow the sale of combustion engine cars beyond the 2035 deadline -- as long as they run on synthetic fuels. It's an exception that could put the European Union's green credentials at risk. The bloc is legally Here's what's at stake. What is happening? The ban on internal combustion engine cars The law envisions a total ban on the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2035. The European Union argues that the deadline is necessary because the average car's lifespan is around 15 years -- so to get a fleet that produces no carbon pollution by 2050, sales of combustion engine cars must end by 2035. But earlier this month, just before the final vote, Germany pushed back on the idea that all internal combustion engines must be banned. Instead, it argued for engines powered by ""green"" fuels to be allowed. Other European countries, including Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic, joined Germany in demanding the exception and after intense negotiations, the EU's Climate Chief Frans Timmermans announced on Saturday that ""an agreement with Germany on the future use of e-fuels in cars"" had been reached. While the text of the law remains unchanged, Germany says it now has the assurances it was seeking from the EU on e-fuels. ""Vehicles with combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they use only CO2-neutral fuels,"" German transport minister Volker Wissing Timmermans said the EU will work now on drafting specific rules to implement the agreement. What are e-fuels? Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels, are made using hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere. Their proponents often portray them as ""clean"", but the reality is not straightforward. Burning these man-made fuels releases The ""green"" credentials refer to the manufacturing process: e-fuels are made from carbon that was removed from the atmosphere, which For climate campaigners and the lawmakers who negotiated the new rules, this is not good enough. ""E-fuels emit carbon dioxide from the tailpipe,"" said Dutch EU lawmaker Jan Huitema, who led in drafting the policy. There are other problems too. For one, e-fuels are not yet produced at scale. The manufacturing process is expensive and requires a lot of renewable energy. Supply of e-fuels is likely to be limited for some time, and critics say they should be reserved for industries that do not have a viable alternative to fossil fuels, such as aviation and shipping. What has been the reaction to the new demands? Many EU policy makers were flabbergasted by the demands from Germany and others. The legislation had been in the works for more than two years and had required many rounds of negotiations. ""I was the lead negotiator with the [European] Council on the final text, it was adopted there by the ambassadors of the different member states,"" said Huitema. ""You have an agreement and now, all of a sudden, a couple of member states want to refrain from the agreement. That is not how you negotiate and how you make deals with each other."" Climate groups say the changes water down action on climate change. Transport & Environment, a clean transport campaign group, said the loophole for e-fuels would slow down the transition to electric vehicles. ""[Germany's] plan would derail the decarbonization of the new fleet while allowing more conventional oil to be used in the existing fleet post-2035 -- a win-win for Big Oil."" Even some carmakers came out against the potential changes to the law. A group of dozens of companies including Volvo and ""First-mover companies have already significantly invested in zero-emission vehicles and should be rewarded for taking the inherent risks to decarbonize their fleet. It would be a very negative signal to reverse the political agreement reached last year,"" they said. What is behind Germany's last-minute objections? Germany is governed by a coalition, and it is one of the parties, the liberal FDP, that called for the changes. ""The internal combustion engine is not the problem. The fossil fuels that run it are,"" Wissing, who is a member of the FDP, Germany is home to some of the world's largest automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Volkswagen, and the government has to walk a tightrope between ambitious climate policies and the interests of a powerful industry that keeps the economy humming. Manufacturers of car components and engines, fossil fuel producers and fuel transportation companies have lobbied for the exception because it would allow them to continue using their existing infrastructure and products. The Federation of German Industries, a lobby group, said e-fuels could make ""a major contribution to achieving the adopted climate targets."" ""Since they can be used immediately without having to build a new infrastructure, they can also be implemented in economically less developed countries,"" according to a The dispute over the legislation has caused friction within Germany's government. Environment Minister Steffi Lemke of the Greens, another coalition party, criticized the challenge to the law. ""Germany should remain a reliable partner to its EU partners. The new CO2 fleet regulation for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, which Germany has supported in recent months, is a major step forward for European climate protection,"" she said in a It all sounds very technical. Why is it important? The law is intended to be one of the world's strongest measures to phase out gasoline vehicles. Scientists say reducing planet-heating pollution Despite such warnings and the pledges made in the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, global emissions have continued to rise, barring a dip in 2020. Some are concerned that the dispute casts doubt on the European Union's ability to implement its ambitious climate agenda. ""This debate is really destabilizing,"" said Elisa Giannelli, a senior policy advisor at E3G, a climate think-tank, noting that the European Union had been ""on track for climate neutrality."" ""Backtracking on a piece of legislation is potentially really undermining the credibility of what we've achieved over the past years,"" she said. ""It's not just about cars. It's about the political signals that that [dispute] sends."" The revised law, which will allow some combustion engines that run on e-fuels to be sold beyond 2035, is expected to be approved on Tuesday.",EU was set to ban internal combustion engine cars.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/29/business/mercedes-eqs-road-trip/index.html,"CNN With electric cars, people often talk about ""range anxiety,"" and how cars with bigger batteries and longer driving ranges will alleviate that. I just drove an electric car from New York City to Atlanta, a distance of about 950 miles, and it taught me something important. The problem really isn't range anxiety. It's anxiety around finding a convenient and working chargers on America's still-challenged charging networks. Back in 2019, I drove a Tesla Model S Long Range from New York City to Atlanta. It was a mostly uneventful trip, thanks to Tesla's nicely organized and well maintained network of fast chargers that can fill the batteries with an 80% charge in a half hour or less. Since then, I've wanted to try that trip again with an electric car that wasn't a Tesla, one that wouldn't have Tesla's unified charging network to rely on. I got my chance with a Mercedes-Benz EQS 450+, a car that is as close to a direct competitor to the Tesla Model S as any. And while I made it to Atlanta without major incident, I encountered glitchy chargers, called the charging network's customer service twice, and experienced some serious charging anxiety during a long stretch of the Carolinas. Long range The EPA estimated range for the Tesla I drove in 2019 was 370 miles, and Tesla's latest models can go even further. The EQS 450+ is officially estimated to go 350 miles on a charge, but I beat that handily without even trying. When I got into the car, its internal displays showed a range estimate of 446 miles. On my trip, the car couldn't stretch its legs quite that far, because I was driving almost entirely on highways at fairly high speeds, but by my calculations, I could have gone between 370 and 390 miles on a charge. I was going to drive over the George Washington Bridge then down through New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia then North Carolina and South Carolina.  I figured three charging stops would be needed and, strictly speaking, that was correct. The driving route laid out by the car's navigation system included three charging stops, but the on-board computers tended push things to the limit. At each stop, the battery would be drained to a little over 10% or so. (I learned later this is a setting I could adjust to be more conservative if I'd wanted.) But I've driven enough electric cars to have some concerns. I use public chargers fairly often, and I know they're imperfect. Sometimes they aren't working as well as they should. Sometimes they're just plain broken. And even if the car's navigation system is telling you that a charger is ""available,"" that can change at any moment. Someone else can pull into the charging spot just a few seconds before you get there. I've learned to be flexible and not push things to the limit. On the first day, when I planned to drive from New York to Richmond, Virginia, no charging stop was called for until Spotsylvania, Virginia, a distance of nearly 300 miles. By that point, I had 16% charge left in the car's batteries which, by the car's own calculation, would have taken me another 60 miles. People need to recharge, too As I sat and worked inside the Spotsylvania Town Centre Stopping without charging was a lost opportunity and it cost me time. If I'm going to stop to recharge myself why not recharge the car, too? But that's the thing, though. A car can be designed to go 350 miles or more before needing to park whereas human beings are not. Elementary school math will tell you that at highway speeds, that's nearly six hours of driving all at once. We need bathrooms, beverages, food, and to just get out and move around once in a while. Sure, it's physically possible to sit in a car for longer than that in one go, but most people in need of speed will take an airplane, and a driver of an EQS, with a starting price just north of $100,000, can almost certainly afford the ticket. I vowed not to make that strategic error again. I was going to take back control. On the second day, I decided, I would choose when I needed to stop, and would look for conveniently located fast chargers so both the EQS and I could get refreshed at once. The EQS's navigation screen pinpointed available charging locations and their maximum charging speeds, so, if I saw an available charger, I could poke on the icon with my finger and add it onto my route. For my first stop after leaving Richmond, I pulled into a rest stop in Hillsborough, North Carolina. It was only about 160 miles south from my hotel and I still had half of a full charge. I sipped coffee and answered some emails while I waited at a counter. I figured I would take as long as I wanted and leave when I was ready with whatever additional electricity the car had gained in that time. In all, I was there about 45 minutes, but at least 15 minutes of that was used trying to get the charger to work. One of the chargers was simply not working at all, and, at another one, a call to Electrify America customer service - the EV charging company owned by Volkswagen that, by coincidence, operated all the chargers I used on the trip - I got a successful charging session going at last. (It was unclear what the issue was.) That was the last and only time I successfully matched my own need to stop with the car's. I left with my battery 91% charged and 358 miles of range showing on the display. I would only need to stop once more on way to Atlanta and not for a long time. Charging deserts Then I began to notice something. As I drove through North Carolina and then South Carolina, the little markers on the map screen indicating available chargers became fewer and fewer. During some fairly long stretches there were none showing at all. It wasn't an immediate concern, though. The EQS's navigation wasn't calling for me to a charge up again until I'd nearly reached the Georgia border. By that point I would have about 11% of my battery charge remaining. But I was getting nervous. Given how far it was between chargers my whole plan of ""recharging the car when I recharge myself"" had already fallen apart. I had to leave the highway once to find a gas station to use the restroom and buy an iced tea. A while later, I stopped for lunch, a big plate of ""Lexington Style BBQ"" with black eyed peas and collard greens in Lexington, North Carolina. None of that involved charging because there no chargers around. So I got back on the highway and I worried. What if there was something wrong with that charger near the border? Fortunately, a charger came into sight on my map while I still had 31% charge remaining. I decided I would protect myself by stopping early. After another call to Electrify America customer service, I was able to get a nice, high-powered charging session on the second charger I tried. After about an hour I was off again with a nearly full battery. I drove the last 150 miles to Atlanta, crossing the state line through gorgeous wetlands and stopping at the Georgia Welcome Center, with hardly a thought about batteries or charging or range. But I was driving $105,000 Mercedes. What if I'd been driving something that cost less and that, while still going farther than a human would want to drive at a stretch, wouldn't go far enough to make that trip as easily. Obviously, people do it. One thing that surprised me on this trip, compared to the one in 2019, was the variety of fully electric vehicles I saw driving the same highways. There were Chevrolet Bolts, Audi E-Trons, Porsche Taycans, Hyundai Ioniqs, Kia EV6s and at least one other Mercedes EQS. Americans are taking their electric cars out onto the highways. But it's still not as easy as it ought to be.",Electric cars don't need better batteries. America needs better charging networks
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/28/business/kia-ev9-unveiled/index.html,"CNN The big Kia Telluride SUV, with three roomy rows of seats, has been a major hit for the South Korean car brand. So, for those ready to switch to electric vehicles, KIa just unveiled its all-electric big SUV. The Kia EV9, like the Telluride, has lots of seats and they can also do some neat tricks. For instance, the second-row seats can swivel all the way around to face the third row seats for comfortable conversing. Or, if you want to sit and look outside, they can face out the door. The EV9 should be able to travel up to about 541 kilometers, or 336 miles, on one full charge, according to the sort of range tests used in Europe, Kia said in an announcement. Kia has not yet announced the range estimate it expects from the United States' Environmental Protection Agency. Long-range versions of the SUV, which will only be equipped with rear-wheel-drive, will be able to go from zero to 100 kilometers per hour, or 62 mph, in about 9.4 seconds. This version will be powered by a single 150 kilowatt, or 201 horsepower, electric motor. More powerful versions will also be available, including an all-wheel-drive version with two motors capable of a combined 282 kilowatts, or 378 horsepower. That version will be able to go from a stop to 100 kilometers per hour in just six seconds, according to Kia. Software to add even more performance through a special ""Boost"" feature will be available as an over-the-air download. The EV9 is about the same length and height as the Telluride, but has a slightly longer wheelbase, meaning the back wheels are farther away from the front wheels. That should allow space for an even roomier interior. The EV9 will be available in seven-seat and six-seat versions. Seven seaters will have a bench seat in the second row while six-seat versions will have two independent second row seats. The EV9 will also have some interesting technology available, including a back seat occupant alert system that uses radar to detect even the slight movement of a child's breathing to warn if a child is inside the vehicle as it's closed and locked. Some other recently introduced electric SUVs, including ones from Volvo and Polestar, will have similar technology. Users will also be able to power items such as laptops, small refrigerators and camping equipment, from the vehicle's battery pack, a functionality more familiar in electric pickups like the Ford F-150 Lightning. The SUV will also have a lot of recycled and renewable materials in its interior, including recycled suede and, in the floor carpets, recycled fishing nets. Bio-polyurethane derived from corn and eucalyptus will be used to replace leather and plastics in some places. Kia hasn't announced pricing for the EV9 yet but the similarly-sized gas-powered Telluride starts at about $37,000. The Telluride has been so The EV9 is expected to go on sale ""in selected global markets"" in the second half of 2023.","The big, electric Kia EV9 has carpets made out of recycled fishing nets"

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah announced in its daily update on Monday that at least 22,835 people have been killed in the besieged enclave since the beginning of the war. That staggering death toll means that 1% of the enclave's total pre-war population of 2.27 million people has now has been wiped out. According to the ministry, an additional 58,416 people have been injured, which means more than one in 40 Gazans have now been wounded in the conflict. The ministry generates its data from hospitals in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. Last month, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it believed that it had The IDF began its operation in Gaza immediately after Hamas launched a terror attack into southern Israel on October 7. Its militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped some 200 others. Some of the hostages who were taken to Gaza have since been released by Hamas in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As of last week, the Israeli government believed 132 hostages from October 7 were still being held in Gaza, of whom dozens are thought dead. One in 120 children is dead The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that more than 5,300 of the dead are women and more than 9,000 were children. With the pre-war child population of Gaza at about 1.1 million, according to UNICEF, this means that one out of every approximately 120 children living in the enclave has been killed. A separate statistic released by the international organization Save the Children said more than 10 children on average have lost one or both of their legs every day in Gaza since October. International organizations have been warning that the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza is now so deep that people are at risk of dying of starvation. According to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), 90% of Gazans have been displaced.  The youngest children are most at risk of starvation, according to a The children's aid organization estimated that in the coming weeks, ""at least 10,000 children under five years will suffer the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, known as severe wasting, and will need therapeutic foods."" The lack of sanitation for the displaced now packed into parts of southern Gaza has led to the spread of contagious and respiratory diseases. Diseases that would normally be easily curable are becoming deadly because of the lack of even the most basic medical equipment. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that he plans to push the Israeli government ""on the absolute imperative to do more to protect civilians"" in Gaza during meetings Tuesday. Blinken said he would also push Israeli officials on the need to increase humanitarian aid entering the war-torn strip ""and also to talk to them about the future direction of their military campaign in Gaza.""",One in 100 people in Gaza has been killed since October 7

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/08/middleeast/hezbollah-commander-killed-intl/index.html,"CNN A senior Hezbollah commander was killed in an Israeli drone strike on his car in southern Lebanon, a Lebanese security source told CNN on Monday, as fears of a wider regional conflict escalate. The official, Wissam Tawil, is the most senior member of the Shiite militant group to be killed in an Israeli strike since Hezbollah and Israel began trading fire across the Lebanese-Israeli border on October 8, the day after Hamas carried out the deadliest terror attack in Israel's history. In a statement, Hezbollah also acknowledged the death of Tawil, who also went by the nom de guerre Hajj Jawad, in an Israeli attack. The paramilitary group shared pictures of him alongside other top Hezbollah officials and Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of the Iranian elite unit that handles the country's overseas operations Israel later claimed responsibility for Tawil's death. ""As for the hit in south Lebanon, we did take responsibility,"" Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz said in an interview with Israel's Channel 14, ""This is part of our war."" ""We are targeting Hezbollah's people, the infrastructure, the systems they managed to put in place in order to deter Israel,"" Katz said. ""We make them pay a price; we did not set a goal to thwart 150,000 missiles. We set a goal to restore security to the residents of the north, to restore security to the residents of the south and to the state of Israel,"" the minister said. Tawil's killing Hezbollah on Saturday launched a rocket barrage against an airbase in northern Israel as part of a ""preliminary response"" into Arouri's killing, which was followed by more intense cross-border fighting between the two sides. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Sunday part of an Israel base was damaged in the attack. Israel has responded by focusing on Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces stationed near the border. ""Our focus on Hezbollah's Radwan forces in southern Lebanon is driving them away from the border. We are determined to continue creating a different security reality in the north, one that ensures safety for the residents,"" Hagari said. Israel on Monday morning struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon after the group fired an anti-tank missile toward the city of Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel, the IDF said. The Lebanese militant group has been launching its own salvos against Israel, the Hezbollah-owned Al Manar news outlet reported. Separately, Israel's military said it had killed Hamas militant Hassan Hakashah in the southern Syrian town of Beit Jinn on Monday, whom it called a ""central figure"" responsible for directing the firing of rockets from Syria towards Israel. Hamas has so far not publicly commented on the death. 'A conflict that could easily metastasize' Tawil's death is the latest incident to fuel concerns that the October 7 terror attack against Israel is now spiraling into a wider regional conflagration. ""This is a moment of profound tension in the region,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday during his visit to the Middle East. ""This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering."" Responding on Monday to the killing of Talil, Blinken said: ""It's clearly not in the interest of anyone, Israel, Lebanon, Hezbollah, for that matter, to see this, to see this escalate and to see an actual conflict."" ""The Israelis have been very clear with us that they want to find a diplomatic way forward that creates the kind of security that allows Israelis to return home,"" he said at a press gaggle in Saudi Arabia ahead of flying to Israel. Nearly 100,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in northern Israel because of the threat from Hezbollah, Blinken said, adding that the US was also working on a diplomatic solution to allow Lebanese citizens to return to their homes in southern Lebanon. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Sunday that while Israel is not looking for war with Hezbollah, if necessary, his country could ""copy-paste"" its military actions in Gaza to Beirut. Gallant said ""the priority isn't to get into a war"" with Hezbollah but ""eighty-thousand people need to be able to go back to their homes safely,"" the WSJ reported. Gallant also stated that if no agreement is negotiated to make that possible, then, Israel wouldn't shrink from military action, adding ""we are willing to sacrifice."" Israel first responded to the October 7 attack by declaring war on Hamas and launching an intensive military operation in Gaza. Its aerial bombardment and ground campaign have now left nearly 23,000 people dead - Both the health ministry in Gaza and its counterpart in the occupied West Bank suggest that approximately 70% of those killed or injured are women and children. Israel says more than 8,000 of the dead are militants it is targeting in its war on Hamas. Further south, Iran-backed On the northern border with Lebanon, fear is growing that what was once tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Hezbollah forces in a four-kilometer range of the border region could spiral further.

Of course, we prefer that this be done without a wide campaign, but that will not stop us,"" he said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/26/business/meta-collecting-data-children-facebook,"CNN Since at least 2019, Meta has knowingly refused to shut down the majority of accounts belonging to children under the age of 13 while collecting their personal information without their parents' consent, a newly unsealed court document from an ongoing federal lawsuit against the social media giant alleges. Attorneys general from 33 states have accused Meta of receiving more than a million reports of under-13 users on Instagram from parents, friends and online community members between early 2019 and mid-2023 The federal complaint calls for court orders prohibiting Meta from the practices the attorneys general allege violate the law. Civil penalties could add up to hundreds of millions of dollars, as Meta allegedly hosts millions of users who are teens and children. Most states are seeking anywhere between $1,000 to $50,000 in fines per violation. Privacy violations According to the 54-count lawsuit, Meta violated a range of state-based consumer protection statutes as well as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA), which prohibits companies from collecting the personal information of children under 13 without a parent's consent. Meta allegedly did not comply with COPPA with respect to both Facebook and Instagram, even though ""Meta's own records reveal that Instagram's audience composition includes millions of children under the age of 13,"" and that ""hundreds of thousands of teen users spend more than five hours a day on Instagram,"" the court document states. One Meta product designer wrote in an internal email that the ""young ones are the best ones,"" adding that ""you want to bring people to your service young and early,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Instagram's Terms of Use prohibit users under the age of 13 (or higher in certain countries) and we have measures in place to remove these accounts when we identify them. However, verifying the age of people online is a complex industry challenge,"" Meta told CNN in a statement on Sunday. ""Many people - particularly those under the age of 13 - don't have an ID, for example. That's why Meta is supporting federal legislation that requires app stores to get parents' approval whenever their teens under 16 download apps. With this approach, parents and teens won't need to provide hundreds of individual apps with sensitive information like government IDs in order to verify their age."" Mentally harmful content The unsealed complaint also alleges that Meta knew that its algorithm could steer children toward harmful content, thereby harming their well-being. According to internal company communications cited in the document, employees wrote that they were concerned about ""content on IG triggering negative emotions among tweens and impacting their mental well-being (and) our ranking algorithms taking [them] into negative spirals & feedback loops that are hard to exit from."" For example, Meta researchers conducted one study in July 2021 that concluded Instagram's algorithm may be amplifying negative social comparison and ""content with a tendency to cause users to feel worse about their body or appearance,"" according to the complaint. In internal emails from February 2021 cited in the lawsuit, Meta employees allegedly recognized that social comparison was ""associated with greater time spent"" on Meta's social media platforms In a March 2021 internal investigation looking at eating disorder content, Meta's team followed users whose account names referenced starvation, skinniness and disordered eating. Instagram's algorithm then began generating a list of recommended accounts ""that included accounts related to anorexia,"" the lawsuit states. However, Antigone Davis, Meta's global head of safety, testified before Congress in September 2021 that Meta does not ""direct people towards content that promotes eating disorders. That actually violates our policies and we remove that content when we become aware of it. We actually use AI to find content like that and to remove it."" ""We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online, and we have over 30 tools to support them and their parents,"" Meta told CNN in a statement. ""We've spent a decade working on these issues and hiring people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online. The complaint mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents."" Senior leadership at Instagram also knew that problematic content was a critical issue for the platform, the lawsuit states. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, allegedly wrote in an internal email that ""social comparison is to Instagram [what] election interference is to Facebook."" The lawsuit does not specify when that email was sent. CNN has reached out to Meta regarding Davis's and Mosseri's comments and did not immediately receive a response. However, despite the company's internal research confirming concerns with social comparison on its platforms, the lawsuit alleges Meta refused to change its algorithm. One employee noted in internal communications cited in the lawsuit that content inciting negative appearance comparisons ""is some of the most engaging content (on the Explore page), so this idea actively goes against many other teams' top-line measures."" Meanwhile, ""Meta's external communications denied or obscured the fact that its Recommendation Algorithms promote High-Negative Appearance Comparison content to young users,"" the lawsuit states. Meta was also aware that its recommendations algorithms ""trigger intermittent dopamine releases in young users"" which can lead to addictive cycles of consumption on its platforms, according to internal documents cited in the lawsuit. ""Meta has profited from children's pain by intentionally designing its platforms with manipulative features that make children addicted to their platforms while lowering their self-esteem,"" said Letitia James, the attorney general for New York, in a Eight additional attorneys general sued Meta last month in various state courts, making similar claims to the massive multistate federal lawsuit. Florida sued Meta in its own The wave of lawsuits is the result of a bipartisan, multistate investigation dating back to 2021, after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen came forward with tens of thousands of internal company documents that she said showed how the company knew its products could have negative impacts on young people's mental health.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/12/middleeast/weapons-us-uk-using-to-strike-yemens-houthis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"CNN After repeated warnings, United States and British forces have followed through on threats to Under the cover of darkness they launched missiles and bombs on targets in Yemen from air and sea overnight Friday. Here's what we know about the weapons and military hardware employed by the US and the UK. Tomahawk missiles The US Navy's Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) are low-flying cruise missiles capable of delivering a 1,000-pound conventional warhead hundreds of miles inland. Launched from either surface ships or submarines, Tomahawks fly at subsonic speeds on ""evasive"" or non-linear routes that can beat air defense systems, according to a US Navy fact sheet. The Tomahawks are highly accurate, and as they are GPS-guided, they can change targets or courses after launch depending upon needs, it says. The ""missile is capable of loitering over a target area in order to respond to emerging targets or, with its on-board camera, provide battle damage information to warfighting commanders,"" the fact sheet says. The US first used Tomahawks in combat in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm against the forces of then-Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, and they've been used in several other conflicts since. Guided-missile submarine USS Florida The submarine USS Florida is one of four nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines (SSGNs) in the US Navy fleet. Originally an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine - which carry nuclear warheads - the Florida and its sister boats USS Ohio, USS Michigan and USS Georgia, were converted to guided-missile subs between 2005 and 2007, according to a Navy fact sheet. The submarine's comparatively large size and power allow it to carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, 50% more than US guided-missile destroyers pack and almost four times as many as  the US Navy's newest attack subs. ""SSGNs can deliver a lot of firepower very rapidly,"" Carl Schuster, a former Navy captain and director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, told CNN in 2021. ""One-hundred and fifty-four Tomahawks accurately deliver a lot of punch. No opponent of the US can ignore the threat,"" he said. While the Navy could amass a larger number of destroyers to deliver missiles in even greater numbers, as a standalone, hard-to-detect unit, the Ohio-class guided missile submarine is in an ocean by itself in America's arsenal, Bradley Martin, a former Navy captain turned naval researcher at the RAND Corp think tank, also said in 2021. ""The SSGN remains the platform with the single largest ability to deliver conventional missile payloads,"" Martin said. The magnitude of that firepower was shown in March 2011, when the USS Florida fired almost 100 Tomahawks against targets in Libya during Operation Odyssey Dawn. That attack marked the first time the SSGNs were used in combat. The Florida is driven by a nuclear reactor providing steam for two turbines, which turn the sub's propeller. The Navy calls its range ""unlimited,"" with its ability to stay submerged constrained only by the need to replenish food supplies for its crew. US Navy guided-missile destroyers The Pentagon said, besides the Florida, US surface ships also launched Tomahawks against the Houthis. The backbone of the US Navy surface fleet is the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, with almost 70 in commission. With a displacement of up to 9,700 tons, the Burke-class carries a range of armaments, both defensive and offensive. The destroyers deploy Tomahawk cruise missiles with their Vertical Launching System (VLS), with each destroyer having 90 to 96 VLS cells, depending upon when it was built. The Pentagon has not said which specific destroyers were involved in the attacks on Yemen, but several of the warships have been in the Red Sea in the past two months Typhoon fighters from Britain The single pilot, twin-engine jets are a mainstay of the UK's air fleet. They fly at speeds as fast high as Mach 1.8 and as high as 55,000 feet, according to a Royal Air Force fact sheet. Developed by a consortium of defense firms to provide multiple NATO nations with a multirole fighter, they are also robust weapons platforms, capable of carrying a range of air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles as well as precision-guided bombs. The UK Defense Ministry said the four involved in the attack on Houthi targets delivered Paveway IV munitions, bombs with 500-pound warheads. The Paveway IV has tail fins that help guide it to its target based on directions the weapon receives either from laser marking or by GPS coordinates transmitted to it. The British Typhoons were supported by a Voyager air refueling tanker which allows the jets to fly longer distances. The UK Defense Ministry did not say where the jets took off from. But video footage posted by Defense Minister Grant Shapps showed a Typhoon",What kind of weapons are the US and UK using to strike Yemen's Houthis?

""There's been multiple traumatic amputations of children ... horrific burns, the likes of which I've never seen before,"" Dr. Nick Maynard told CNN's Isa Soares on Monday after his team found themselves with no choice but to withdraw from the hospital, following increased Israeli military activity. He said that often ""there is no pain relief to give to these patients at all,"" underscoring the dire humanitarian situation and lack of medical supplies in the Palestinian enclave following more than three months of Israeli bombardment. ""I think it's fair to say I've never seen anything like this. And I never expect that in my life I would see such an appalling situation,"" said Maynard, who was speaking from the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Monday after leaving Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said it is not targeting civilians. The IDF has also said that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as shields for its attacks on Israel, and that attacking those targets are essential as it works to eliminate Hamas from the enclave. Israel has also said some hospitals are being used as command centers but has provided limited evidence to support that claim. The IDF's operations are contentious, with humanitarian organizations warning that a growing number of medical facilities across Gaza are rendered unable to provide basic services. ""I've been going to Gaza for nearly 15 years now, I have many friends who work in hospitals there. There are many examples of hospitals being attacked. In the last two days since I left Al-Aqsa hospital, there have been attacks on the hospital,"" Maynard told CNN. The British surgeon had been in Gaza for two weeks, an experience he described as ""frightening,"" saying his team pulled out as the conflict came closer. ""There was an attack on the intensive care unit,"" he said. ""We were due to leave it about that time anyways but the following morning, the whole area was taken out of the de-confliction (zone), and we were told by the Israeli Defense Forces that we would not be able to go."" CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment but is yet to hear back. The doctor said his organization, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), and Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), were both operating at the hospital but ""both sets of foreign doctors had to leave."" MAP and the emergency medical team of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced their withdrawal from the Al-Aqsa Hospital on Sunday citing increasing Israeli military activity in the area. As Maynard and his team left Gaza for their safety, he fears that ""there are not enough staff to run the hospital in any form at all now."" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), warned Sunday that Al-Aqsa hospital was the ""most important hospital remaining"" in central Gaza. He demanded that medical staff and their families be protected, adding the facility ""must remain functional."" 'An entire generation of orphans' Israel's bombardment of Gaza began after Hamas launched its brutal October 7 assault in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians were killed and more than 200 people taken hostage. Since then, about At least 23,084 Palestinians have been killed and 58,926 others injured in Gaza since October 7, the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Monday. The Ministry of Health in Ramallah said that more than 5,300 of the dead are women and more than 9,000 were children. CNN is not able to independently verify numbers released by the two ministries. A separate statistic released by the international organization Save the Children said more than 10 children on average have Israel's military campaign has sparked an international outcry with a growing number of nations backing calls for a ceasefire. The United States has been pressuring Israeli officials in the last several weeks to do more to protect civilians and implement more strategic strikes but has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire. As deaths continue to climb, the conflict in Gaza has created ""an entire generation of orphans,"" King Abdullah II of Jordan said in a speech on Monday. ""More children have died in Gaza than in all other conflicts around the world this past year,"" Abdullah said according to the speech which was Abdullah's made his remarks during a visit to the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda's capital, according to Jordan's Petra news agency. ""How can indiscriminate aggression and shelling bring peace? How can they guarantee security, when they build on hatred?"" Abdullah asked. ""Without a just peace, on the basis of the two-state solution, the world will continue to pay a heavy price for failing to resolve this conflict, and we will never know true peace and stability in the Middle East,"" he warned. The speech in Rwanda came after Abdullah of Jordan met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Amman on Sunday, where the two ""agreed to continue close coordination for sustained humanitarian assistance"" in Gaza, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Sunday.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/09/middleeast/israel-genocide-case-world-court-gaza-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN Israel is It is an unprecedented case. Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the United Nations' Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after the Second World War in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust. The South African government, a successor to the apartheid regime that was made a pariah on the international stage three decades ago, Israel has Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Tuesday that his country will present a case ""using self-defense"" to show that it is doing its ""utmost"" under ""extremely complicated circumstances"" to avert civilian casualties in Gaza. Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN the case is significant politically and legally. ""An allegation of genocide is the gravest international legal allegation that can be made against a state,"" he said. Here's what we know about this case. What is South Africa saying? South Africa has taken Israel to the ICJ, also known as the World Court, on claims that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and failing to prevent genocide. On the first of two days of hearings, South Africa on Thursday told the court that Israel's leadership had ""declared their genocidal intent"" in public comments surrounding the war, and that the actions of its military showed a ""pattern of genocidal conduct."" South Africa's representatives argued that ""the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel... is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group."" ""The acts in question include killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction,"" South Africa added in its More than 23,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. The United Nations defines genocide as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" The In eight pages, the filing at the ICJ details what South Africa describes as ""expressions of genocidal intent"" by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his cabinet. South Africa has also asked the court to issue "" The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed the case. What is the International Court of Justice? The ICJ is based in The Hague in the Netherlands and was set up in June 1945 by the Charter of the United Nations. The court tries governments while the International Criminal Court, also in The Hague, Member states of the UN and those who have accepted the ICJ's jurisdiction can present cases. The court  Ad-hoc judges can be appointed by parties in contentious cases (between two states) - in this instance Israel and South Africa - bringing the number of judges in the case to 17. South Africa Experts say a final ruling could take years. How has Israel responded? Israel has called the case a "" ""And I ask: where were you, South Africa, and the rest of those who slander us, where were you when millions were murdered and displaced from their homes in Syria, Yemen and other arenas. You weren't there,"" the prime minister said. Israel will nonetheless appear before the court. That's because it is a signatory to the UN's 1948 ""Since the court clearly has jurisdiction, it would be strange if Israel would simply not appear,"" said Lieblich. ""Also, genocide is a grave allegation, and states usually want to make their case."" The Israeli public's view of the case reflects the political disagreements in the country, Lieblich said. ""Some view the proceedings as just another case of international bias against Israel. Many others are angry because they think that the case was only made possible because of irresponsible statements by far-right politicians, that in their views don't represent actual policy."" But he said that few in the Israeli mainstream are willing to accept the genocide allegations. ""They mostly view the war as one of self-defense against Hamas, which due to the latter's tactics result in wide but unintended harm to civilians."" Polls show that Israelis Citing an Israeli diplomatic cable, Axios reported that Israel has mobilized its diplomats to lobby host nations to back its position and create international pressure against the case. Its ""strategic goal,"" it said, is for the court to reject the request for an injunction, refrain from accusing Israel of committing genocide, and acknowledge that it is operating according to international law. ""A ruling by the court could have significant potential implications that are not only in the legal world but have practical bilateral, multilateral, economic, security ramifications,"" Axios cited the cable as saying. Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy He also accused it of double standards, and backing former ""How tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro bono for anti-Jewish racists,"" he said in a January 2 speech posted on X. ""We assure South Africa's leaders: History will judge you. And it will judge you without mercy."" Lieblich said South Africa appears to be positioning itself in opposition to the US' dominance in the international order. ""While it pursues the case against Israel, South Africa has criticized the ICC's arrest warrant against Why is this case significant? While the ICJ has ruled against Israel in the past, it did so through non-binding ""advisory opinions"" that are requested by UN bodies such as the General Assembly. This is the first time Israel is being sued in the ICJ in what is known as a ""contentious case,"" where states directly raise cases against each other. In 2004, the ICJ issued an If the ICJ eventually rules that Israel is directly responsible for genocide, it will be the first time it has found a state has commited genocide, experts said. ""This would be a significant precedent first and foremost because the ICJ never ruled, so far, that a state actually committed genocide,"" Lieblich said. ""The farthest it went was to rule that Serbia failed to prevent genocide by militias in Srebrenica. In this sense, such a ruling would be legally uncharted territory."" While no state has been found to be directly responsible for genocide by the court, both Myanmar and Russia have faced provisional measures in genocide cases in recent years. All ICJ But the ICJ can't guarantee compliance. In March 2022, for example, What happens if the court orders Israel to halt the war? Israel is set to appear in public hearings before the court on Friday to contest South Africa's genocide accusations. A ruling on genocide could take years to prove, but the injunction on the Gaza war that Pretoria has asked the ICJ for could come much sooner. Daniel Machover, a London-based lawyer and international justice expert, told CNN that a provisional measure should be a quick decision that would be taken before there is a final ruling on genocide. South Africa, he said, only needs to demonstrate that it has standing to bring the case, has acted on its duty to prevent genocide, that there is a ""plausible legal argument"" that violations of the Genocide Convention are or may be taking place, and that there is a real and imminent risk that irreparable prejudice will be caused to Gaza residents before the court gives its final decision, such that the court needs to order Israel to stop the war. Francis Boyle, an American human rights lawyer Boyle, based on his experience in the Bosnian case, said the order could come within a week of this week's hearings. Lieblich doubts that Israel would cease the fighting altogether should the court issue an injunction on the war. Instead, it could attack the legitimacy of the court and its judges, ""considering that some of them are from states that don't recognize Israel."" It would also matter whether the decision is unanimous, he added. ""The consequences of non-compliance might range from reputational harm and political pressure to sanctions and other measures by third states or further resolutions in the UN,"" he said. ""The key for Israel would probably be how its key allies would act in such a case."" He added that while the threshold for an injunction is relatively low, in the main case, proving genocide requires two elements: proof that certain unlawful acts were committed, and that these acts were committed with specific intent to destroy a certain group. ""In past ICJ cases the court required a high threshold to prove such allegations,"" he said. ""Here the challenge for South Africa would be to prove that statements by some Israeli officials actually reflect the state's 'intent' as a whole, and also that Israel's actions on the ground were both unlawful and actually tied to an intent to destroy the group as such."" Could a ruling have implications outside Israel? The fallout of an ICJ ruling could spread beyond Israel, according to experts. It would not only embarrass Israel's closest ally, the US, but could also deem Washington complicit in the alleged violation of the Genocide Convention. ""Even though the South African application focuses on Israel, it has huge implications for the United States, especially President Joe Biden and his principal lieutenants,"" ""Why? Because there is little doubt that the Biden administration is complicitous"" in Israel's war, he said. Biden has acknowledged that Israel is carrying out ""Leaving aside the legal implications of his behavior, Biden's name - and America's name - will be forever associated with what is likely to become one of the textbook cases of attempted genocide,"" Mearsheimer wrote. Even if Israel ignores an order by the ICJ, there will be a legal obligation among other signatories to comply, said Machover. ""So, anyone assisting Israel at that point will be in breach of that order."" ""We could have worldwide litigation if states don't stop assisting Israel... there will be legal ripples across the world"" he said. The case could also have an impact on the Israeli public, Machover said. He believes that a significant number of Israelis ""have not looked in the mirror"" and lack awareness of the real impact of the war on Palestinians in Gaza. The ICJ case, he hopes, would prompt the Israeli public to engage in ""some sort of self-reflection.""",Israel is facing a genocide case in international court. Could it halt the war in Gaza?

How they woke to the sound of sirens and hid in their shelter. How the gunshots got nearer. How, when the doors burst open, their grandfather rushed out of the shelter so Hamas gunmen wouldn't see the rest of them hiding inside. How he was taken. How they left the door open to the shelter in the hope other attackers would think it had already been raided and move on. How that didn't work. ""Another terrorist unit entered and took us also,"" Asher told CNN. Asher, her mother and daughters, 5-year-old Raz and 2-year-old Aviv, were thrown into the back of a tractor with other hostages from the kibbutz, before gunmen opened fire. Asher was shot in her back; Aviv was shot in the leg; her mother was shot dead. Asher, 34, and her daughters were taken In an exclusive interview with CNN, Asher described her nearly 50 days in captivity, the ""psychological warfare"" to which she was subjected, the conditions in which she was kept, and her sense of guilt after being freed while scores of others - including 79-year-old Gadi Moses, her daughters' grandfather - remain in captivity. Asher and her daughters were taken first to an apartment that belonged to a family in Gaza. ""They stitched my wounds without anesthetic, on the couch while my girls were next to me,"" Asher said. After being exposed to the October 7 terror attack that she called a ""war movie,"" Asher said she tried to reassure her daughters the danger was over. ""I told them there are no terrorists anymore and we're with good people now who are guarding us until we can return home,"" she said. The three of them were watched over every hour of the day by children and grandchildren of the owner of the house. Asher never learned their names, but was able to communicate with the father, whom she said spoke Hebrew as he used to work in Israel. While Asher and her daughters were not harmed physically, she said she was subjected to ""psychological warfare."" ""They didn't give us a lot of information, they mainly tried to say that Hamas wants to release us but in Israel no one cares about us,"" Asher said. ""That we won't return to live in the kibbutz because it's not our house - it's not the place where we belong."" But she said she did not believe them - and that the sound of fighting outside the building in Gaza was ""how we knew that something was going on in order to get us back home, to put pressure on Hamas to release us."" After 16 days, Asher and her daughters were taken from the apartment to what she described as a ""so-called"" hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. Why ""so-called""? Because a hospital is ""a place that is supposed to take care of people, but instead it was taken over by Hamas and they used it to hide hostages,"" Asher said. The Israeli military has repeatedly said Hamas hides terrorist infrastructure in and around civilian institutions in Gaza, such as hospitals - a claim denied by the militant group. The US has said that Hamas used the Asher was joined by other hostages in the hospital complex - the first captives she had met since being taken into Gaza. She said she received some medication when her daughters became sick while being kept inside, ""but it wasn't enough."" When Aviv contracted a fever, Asher put her in the sink with cold water to bring her temperature down. ""She was screaming. They would tell us to keep quiet, but the girl had a fever and I had to take care of her somehow."" They remained in the hospital for nearly five weeks. Asked what her darkest moment was, Asher said ""surprisingly, it was the day that we were released."" When they were ""smuggled"" out of the hospital into a Hamas vehicle, she did not know where she was being taken. ""No one told us that we were getting released,"" she said, ""so the drive through the streets of Gaza was very, very frightening."" She said the streets were lined with thousands of people - including children and the elderly - trying to hit the car and knock on its windows. Asher said she feared she would be lynched. ""This is the first time that Raz said to me, after a month and a half of me protecting her, 'Mommy, I'm scared,'"" Asher said. A total of 105 people were released by Hamas during a temporary truce with Israel, which began on November 24 and ended December 1. Videos capturing some of the moments the hostages were transferred to Red Cross staff often showed Hamas members acting kindly towards the hostages, holding the hands of elderly women, for instance, and helping them out of cars. ""It's one big show,"" Asher said. ""Before I was released, my girls and I were barefoot for 50 days. We were cold because they were wearing short sleeves in November."" But before they were handed over to Red Cross staff, they were given shoes and Hamas members ""put me in a nice dress,"" Asher said. Once they were back in Israel, Asher and her daughters were taken to a hospital in Tel Aviv before being discharged and returning home. The first thing her daughters did was ""to go outside to feel the wind on their skin,"" Asher said. ""We didn't see daylight that entire time ... for them, just to be able to run outside, here in our yard, that's the first thing they did."" The Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad - another Islamist group operating in Gaza - released a video in December showing Gadi Moses and another hostage, Gadi Katzir, 47, speaking in front of the camera, asking the Israeli government to arrange their release. ""He got very skinny - we saw him in the video,"" Asher said. ""I can't comprehend what has happened to my family, and I can't comprehend the inhumanity of them.

Seven countries - Chad, Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Kuwait and India - had poor air quality that far exceeded the WHO guidelines with average air pollution over 50 micrograms per cubic meter. The study looked specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, which is the tiniest pollutant but also the most dangerous. When inhaled, the PM2.5 travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health problems including WHO Millions of people die each year from air pollution-related health issues. In 2016, around The report also continues to highlight a worrying inequality: the lack of monitoring stations in developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, which results in a dearth of air quality data in those regions. Although Africa saw improvement in the number of countries included in this year's report Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, said that each time it adds a new country that once lacked air quality data - as it did with Chad in 2021 - those countries inevitably wind up at the top of the most-polluted list. ""If you look at what's called satellite or modeled data, Africa is supposed to be probably the most polluted continent on the planet, but we don't have enough data,"" Hammes told CNN. ""What that means is there's a whole lot more data that's needed in order for us to truly determine what are the most polluted countries and cities in the world."" But one of the biggest barriers right now, she said, is ""the way that governments currently monitor air quality."" Hammes said most governments tend to invest in instruments that fail to accurately measure fine particulate matter in the air. In the United States, the report found air pollution improved significantly last year compared with 2021 due to a relatively mild wildfire season. Coffeyville, Kansas, had the worst air quality in the US last year, which IQAir attributed to a nearby oil refinery. Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta and Chicago topped the list of major US cities with the worst air quality, though the researchers also noted that California was home to 10 of the 15 worst major cities for air pollution, including Los Angeles and Sacramento. Around the world, researchers said, the main sources of air pollution last year were wildfires and the ""This is literally about how we as a planet are continuing this unhealthy relationship with fossil fuels,"" Hammes said. ""We are still dependent on fossil fuels and fossil fuels are responsible for the majority of air pollution that we encounter on this planet."" China, which had for decades been near the top of the list for the worst air pollution, continued to show Still, IQAir notes that the Climate change-fueled wildfires, Hammes said, also play a significant role in worsening air quality, especially in the US. The report notes that wildfires in recent years have been rapidly erasing air quality improvements that the US has made over the past decade. ""Wildfires are very much so a global warming issue, and it is creating essentially unsafe conditions,"" Hammes said. Hammes said countries must learn from each other, noting that the countries with best air quality, for example, are the ones taking on specific actions to transition away from polluting industries and into She adds it is also important to expand air quality monitoring networks, especially in predominantly disadvantaged regions. For instance, despite Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, the IQAir report shows that Ukraine expanded air monitoring networks, collecting data from nearly triple the number of cities in 2022 than in 2021. ""What we've learned is that what gets measured gets done,"" Hammes said. ""We need to collect more data. We need to inform folks of this information, and it does need to be free and available, so that they can make more informed choices.""",Only 13 countries and territories had 'healthy' air quality in 2022

Success has come gradually, but has now been capped off in the form a three-row crossover SUV named after Colorado ski town. Kia's award-winning Telluride is selling so fast that its West Point, Georgia, factory can't make them fast enough. Kia dealers have, on average, a 15-day supply of Tellurides on their lots, according to data from Cox Automotive. In real terms, that means that these SUVs are going out almost as fast as they come in. By contrast, GMC dealers have an average 76-day supply of the Acadia and Toyota dealers have an average 51-day supply of the Highlander. Both are competitors to the Telluride. Ben Burton, general manager at Parkside Kia in Knoxville, Tennessee, said he already has a buyer lined up for each Telluride he expects to get from now through September. ""As soon as I get a VIN number, people are like 'OK, that's the one I want,' he said. ""They haven't seen the car, they haven't touched the car, they haven't smelled the car and they're contracted on the car and they're ready to go."" Demand for the SUV was helped, Burton said, by a Also helping has been a string of awards for the Telluride. Among the most prominent were the The Telluride excelled in virtually every way, said Mark Rechtin, editor-in-chief at MotorTrend, from design to ride and handling and interior functionality. ""It was almost a unanimous decision to make it SUV of the Year,"" he said. ""They nailed it."" Production troubles The big, roomy Telluride was very much an American project. It was designed at Kia's Irvine, California, design studio with the goal of creating a spacious Beyond its own attributes, the Telluride happens to fall into a market segment that's doing relatively well at the moment. Auto sales are down due to the coronavirus, but midsize SUVs are among the sort of vehicles that have been doing best, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. (Pickups and small crossovers are doing even better.) Telluride production started in February, 2019, but the factory shut down for the month of April, 2020, due to concerns about coronavirus and because of parts supply disruptions caused by the pandemic But even at that pace, production can't keep up. As a result, some dealers are charging more than the sticker price for Tellurides, something that rarely happens in the auto industry. Usually customers negotiate discounts from dealers. In this case, dealers are telling customers: If On average, Kia Tellurides sell for 3% over the manufacturer's suggested retail price, according to data from TrueCar, an auto pricing website. Toyota Highlanders are selling for 7% below MSRP and Ford Explorers 8% below. Even the similarly-sized Hyundai Palisade, which shares much of its engineering with the Telluride, sells for slightly below the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or The differences between the Palisade and Telluride are so slight that customers' preference for the Kia mostly comes down to styling, said Rick Case. He owns a chain of car dealerships including several Hyundai dealers and two Kia dealers. Case insists his dealers never charge above sticker as a matter of policy. ""It's too short-lived and too long remembered,"" he said of the profit taking practice. Making things even more profitable for Kia and its dealers, the Tellurides customers want most aren't the base model but more luxurious trim levels with more options and higher starting prices. Sticker price for the base model Telluride LX starts at about $32,000. Prices for the SX, the top trim level, start at $10,000 more. That includes features like 20-inch wheels, two sunroofs, a high-end 10-speaker stereo, more chrome on the outside and more leather inside. ""The ones that we were testing were in the $46,000 to $48,000 price band and we were looking at each other and saying, 'This is nicer than a Mercedes,'"" said MotorTrend's Rechtin. Gradual changes Not too many years ago, Kia's brand image could be summed up in a single word: cheap. That's been changing over the years as the Kias have begun looking more stylish. Kia's global head of design, Peter Schreyer, previously worked at Audi. Kias also usually provide a sharper driving feel than than competitors, such as Toyota and Nissan. Cars like the Kia Stinger compete credibly against German sports sedans, at least in terms of performance and available features The brand is also earning a reputation for quality. Kia finished at the very top among mass market auto brands in J.D. Power & Assoc. Initial Quality survey for each of the past six years. That's a big change from Kia's early days in the US market, said Burton, who has worked with the company for nearly 20 years. ""We used to take bets to see how soon somebody would return in a Sportage or a Spectra with a 'Check Engine' light on,"" he said. Those days are long gone, he said, and now people are waiting their turn to buy SUVs costing as much as $50,000. ""The vehicles, went from truly a throwaway car where you'd buy it, you run the wheels off of it then you toss it,"" he said. ""Now people are buying these things because it's, in some cases, a luxury automobile.""",Demand for the Kia Telluride SUV is so high dealers can't keep them on their lots

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/middleeast/israel-mood-gaza-war-intl-cmd,"CNN Yoav Peled says he has started wondering if the world has gone mad. Sitting outside the Kirya, Israel's equivalent of the Pentagon in Tel Aviv, Peled was cutting pieces of yellow ribbon off a large wheel last Thursday, handing them out to strangers passing by. The bands symbolize solidarity with the roughly 240 It is this solidarity - and specifically whether it still extends beyond Israel's borders ""I used to consider myself part of the extreme liberals, whatever they call themselves. But when I see demonstrations with cries in support of Hamas and stuff like that, I doubt that the world understands complexity ... and when they can't understand complexity, they see this as a one-sided thing and their sense of justice is very simple. But it's not simple,"" he told CNN. ""I think the governments understand this, but the people... I don't know."" As global leaders continue to pile pressure on Israel over the mounting civilian death toll from its bombardment of Gaza and It's a feeling that cuts across the deep divisions within Israeli society: the world does not understand us. ""The world loves us as victims. I'm sorry to say that, but yes, they love Israel, they sympathize with the Jews when we are victims, when they kill us. But when we do things to protect ourselves? No,"" Sigal Itzahak told CNN. A teacher at a religious school for girls, Itzahak brought some of her students to the little plaza outside the Kirya where Peled was handing out the ribbons. The spot has become a gathering place for the victims' families, their supporters, and well-wishers after the October 7 terror attacks. Missing people posters and photographs of the victims are displayed on the wall of the government complex, a seemingly never-ending row of smiling faces of men, women, children, babies, soldiers, and, at times, entire families. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said more than 1,400 people were murdered in the attacks. About 240 people were kidnapped and are believed to be held by Hamas and others in Gaza. Four women - two Americans and two Israelis - have been released, while one soldier has been rescued by the IDF. ""I think any country in the world that would find itself in our situation would probably do much, much more and no one would say anything. It's just the Jews. Because the Jews are not entitled to live in a country in peace. That's what we want. And I'm sorry, but no one understands it,"" Itzahak said. Anger against Netanyahu There is a lot of love outside the Kirya complex. Some people come here to pray, hug each other, and spend time together. The group of students brought by Itzahak came with dozens of freshly baked loaves of bread, a powerful and deeply meaningful gesture in Judaism. But there's also a lot of anger and frustration. Most of it is aimed squarely at Israel's embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Benny Zweig, a retired professor of sociology and political science, told CNN he has been coming to the square to protest against Netanyahu since day one of the war. ""Two shifts a day. From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.,"" he said, holding a sign depicting Netanyahu and other members of his government in jail. Like many in Israel, Zweig is placing some of the blame for the brutal October 7 Hamas attack on Netanyahu. ""We should have taken down Hamas a long time ago, but instead Netanyahu started allowing Qatari money in,"" he said referencing Netanyahu's decision to allow ""You're not going to change a terror organization's agenda with money. Now, the price of taking them down will be much higher,"" Zweig said. It's been a month since the attack and Ruby Chen still has had no news about his son, Itay. The second of three sons, a former Boy Scout, and a fierce basketball player, Itay was kidnapped on October 7. Like many of the families with loved ones held in Gaza, Chen is pushing for the Israeli government to do whatever it can to bring the hostages home. ""It should not be the second co-objective of the war. It must be the first, the second, and the third objective to bring the hostages back,"" he told CNN. On Saturday night, Chen and hundreds of other family members of the hostages gathered outside the Kirya to demand ""greater actions by the government."" They pitched up tents in the plaza, vowing to stay until their children, siblings, parents, grandparents, and other loved ones were released. The organizers of the event said it was not ""an anti-government protest,"" but their frustration was clear. In the early days after the Hamas terror attack, many of the hostages' families were reluctant to criticize the government of Netanyahu. That has now changed. A strongly worded statement issued by the Hostage and Missing Families Forum last week spoke of the ""enormous anger"" that the government was not speaking to them about the operation in Gaza. A tense meeting between Netanyahu and some of the families, led to further heated exchanges, including a demand that the government should consider an ""everyone for every one deal"" Such a deal would involve exchanging the hostages for Palestinians currently held in Israeli prisons - some 6,630 people, according to estimates by the Palestinian Prisoner's Society. It would be highly controversial because many of the prisoners have been either convicted or held on charges or suspicions related to acts of terrorism. The IDF dismissed the Hamas offer as a tool of ""psychological terror aimed to manipulate Israeli civilians."" In October 2011, Israel agreed to exchange Gilad Shalit, an IDF soldier kidnapped by Hamas in 2006, for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including convicted terrorists who went on to carry out further attacks. Chen said he still believes the government should do everything it can to secure the release of the hostages. ""I'm not in a position to understand the dynamics. At the end of the day, we look at the end results ... I still don't know if my kid is dead or alive. That's the bottom line,"" he added. The families have said that no ceasefire should be agreed until all the hostages are released. And the country is ""I voted for someone else, but I think he has done wonderful things for Israel, he was a soldier, he was a courageous soldier, but he has been the prime minister for 15 years, so he is to blame. And he has to go. I think everybody knows this and he knows it as well,"" Itzahak said. Support for Netanyahu and his government has collapsed, with the But while the government's approval ratings are nose-diving, the decision to launch a war on Hamas has firm backing from most Jewish Israelis - despite the strong international criticism. And while most of Israel's Arab and Palestinian citizens, and a small minority of Jews, don't approve of the war, a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech means that any form of dissent against the war is risky.  Public displays of solidarity with Gaza or criticism of Israel's military response are few and far between. Demonstrations against the war have been banned and more than 100 people have been arrested for posting messages of solidarity with Gaza on social media. 'Very fine line' in criticizing Israel ""I am 22 and I've been to four funerals in the past four weeks, and two more funerals in the past year, when two of my friends were killed in terror attacks,"" Yonatan Rapaport told CNN at Zion Square in Jerusalem city center on Thursday. A musician who recently finished his compulsory military service with the Israeli Navy - including stints patrolling around the Gaza Strip - Rapaport said he, too, was getting frustrated with the world ""When people ask, 'why are you taking Gaza?' what I don't understand is - do we not have the right to protect our civilians and soldiers? What is a proportionate response? We try not to kill civilians,"" he said. ""This conflict (between Israel and the Palestinians) isn't black and white, but this war (with Hamas) is,"" he added. ""There's very valid criticism of the Israeli government and Israel, but there's a very fine line that has been crossed in a lot of these conversations between criticizing Israel and hating Jews. You can criticize Israel occupying the West Bank or Gaza, but you can't say oh, so because of that it's okay to kill 1,400 civilians."" Rapaport said he had criticized Netanyahu's government before the war, opposing his plans to reform the judicial system - a major fault line that has split the country. ""After the war, I think the whole government should go. But now... we are at war. I don't trust Netanyahu as a person, but I have to trust him as a leader,"" he said. Later that night, Rapaport joined a large circle of musicians and mostly young people sitting at Zion Square. They were playing guitars and singing classic Israeli hits. The songs ranged from sad to hopeful. Among them, ""Lu Yehi,"" a song inspired by the Beatles' song ""Let It Be."" The ballad was written by Naomi Shemer in 1973, during the first days of the Yom Kippur War, and has since become synonymous with that war and hope for Israel's victory. On Thursday night, the song's words rang out in Zion Square, almost exactly 50 years since its debut and with Israel once more at war.",The world is turning against Israel's war in Gaza - and many Israelis don't understand why

Hundreds gathered in southern Gaza to mourn Abu Daqqa on Saturday as his body was laid to rest, with his mother Umm Maher sobbing as she knelt down to pray over her son's grave. Al Jazeera correspondent and Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh was also injured in the attack, the Qatar-based news network said in a statement to CNN on Friday. Dahdouh was eventually evacuated to a hospital, but Abu Daqqa's injury was too severe to survive, according to Walid Alomari, Al Jazeera's bureau chief for Jerusalem and the West Bank. ""Too many in Gaza bleed and die because ambulances can't reach them,"" he said. The network went on to accuse Israel of ""systematically targeting and killing Al Jazeera journalists and their families."" A statement called on the international community to take ""immediate action to hold the Israeli government and military accountable."" CNN cannot independently verify the allegations. Responding to a request for comment from CNN on the network's claim, the press office for the IDF said: ""The IDF takes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists. ""The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists. Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks. The IDF will continue to counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians."" In a later statement in response to CNN's reporting, the IDF said that an ambulance had been dispatched to help Abu Daqqa but it ""encountered road damage"" and couldn't reach the scene in time. ""Once we became aware of an injured individual and received a request to grant permission for an ambulance, COGAT (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories) granted permission for the ambulance to use a safe passage,"" the IDF statement read. ""However, the ambulance chose a different route, which encountered road damage. The IDF promptly responded by sending a bulldozer to assist in repairing the pathway for the ambulance. Unfortunately, by the time these efforts were completed, it was already too late,"" it added. The IDF said it was unable to provide additional detail when asked by CNN how long it took for the ambulance to be granted permission to travel to the site where Abu Daqqa required emergency medical assistance. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists' (CPJ) Four other Al Jazeera journalists have been injured, CPJ says, including three in southern Lebanon and Dahdouh, who had also lost his wife, daughter, son and grandson in an attack on Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza late October. Under fire Abu Daqqa and Dahdouh were on assignment in the southern city of Khan Younis when they came under fire. Dahdouh later recounted the moments leading up to the incident. He said it took place when they were heading back to an ambulance belonging to the Palestinian Civil Defense after they were done filming in an area of Khan Younis that was hard to reach. ""Suddenly, something happened, a big thing, I couldn't tell what it was, I only felt something big happened and pushed me to the ground, the helmet fell and the microphone,"" Dahdouh ""I saw there was an intense bleeding from my shoulder and arm, and I realized if I stayed, I will be bleeding there in that location, and no one will reach me,"" he added. Dahdouh said he was able to reach Civil Defense staff hundreds of meters away but was unable to help Abu Daqqa, fearing they would be targetted. Al Jazeera said on air that Abu Daqqa was bleeding for five hours and no-one could reach to him due to the situation around him. At least 17 others were killed and dozens of others were injured early Friday morning after artillery fire struck the city's Haifa school and a residential home in the area.

CNN has reached out to the Saudi foreign ministry for comment. ""The Saudi government is still open to normalization on condition that Israel takes concrete steps on the ground to create the foundations of a two-state solution,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst, told CNN. ""That would be, for example, completely removing the blockade from Gaza, fully empowering the PA (Palestinian Authority) in Gaza and (the) West Bank, withdrawal from key areas in (the) West Bank etc."" The steps, Shihabi said, must be ""concrete and not empty promises that Israel could forget about after normalization like it did with other countries that normalized (with Israel)."" While Blinken did not call for a ceasefire in Gaza, he added that Israel's further integration into the Middle East would require that ""the conflict end in Gaza,"" as well as the paving of a ""practical pathway"" to a Palestinian state. The Palestinians seek an independent state in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. Most Muslim and Arab countries have refused to recognize Israel until such a state is established. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have repeatedly In 2020, four Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan, Seen as one of the architects of the accords, UAE ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba The treaty between the UAE and Israel ""immediately stops annexation (of the West Bank) and the potential of violent escalation. It maintains the viability of a two-state solution as endorsed by the Arab League and international community,"" Otaiba said. While the establishment of a Palestinian state has been Riyadh's official stance for two decades, the demand had been absent from official rhetoric in recent years, before the October 7 attack. When asked about Saudi Arabia's requirements for normalization with Israel, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) At the time, The October 7 attack on Israel and the devastating war in Gaza that followed prompted Saudi Arabia to pause normalization talks with an Israeli government despised in an Arab world that sees it as responsible for the suffering of Palestinians.  Since the war, the US has suggested that sidestepping Palestinian rights, in order to integrate Israel in the region, may not be tenable. Normalization talks seem once again to be prioritizing Palestinian rights. ""Given how inflamed Saudi public opinion is in light of the war in Gaza, Riyadh will now need much more meaningful Israeli concessions towards the Palestinians, possibly including the creation of a provisional Palestinian state,"" said Firas Maksad, senior fellow and director of outreach at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC. Israel's war on Hamas has so far killed more than 23,000 in Gaza, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in the enclave. Israel launched the war in response to Hamas' October 7 attack, during which Palestinian militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Israel believes 107 hostages seized that day are still being held in Gaza, along with the bodies of 25 who are dead. ""While we still, going forward even after October 7, believe in normalization, it does not come at the cost of the Palestinian people,"" Prince Khalid, the Saudi ambassador, told the BBC, describing Palestinians as ""the key element"" in any normalization deal with Israel. ""This is not a Saudi-Israeli peace plan, this is a Palestinian-Israeli peace plan."" Asked whether Hamas would be part of any future Palestinian state, the ambassador did not rule out the prospect, saying it ""requires a lot of thought, a lot of work... there is always room for change if you have optimism and hope."" Riyadh is not in a hurry Saudi Arabia can, however, afford to wait until conditions are right for a deal with Israel, Maksad told CNN. Saudi-Israel normalization has become one of the main US policy objectives in the Middle East. Biden, who during his presidential campaign promised to turn Saudi Arabia into a ""pariah"" for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey, put his differences with MBS aside over the past two years as Riyadh signaled its willingness to embrace Israel. For the Biden administration, brokering a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be a major foreign policy victory ahead of this year's presidential elections. ""Congressional delegations, composed of both Democrats and Republicans, now visit this kingdom frequently, and relations with the Biden administration have rebounded after a bumpy start,"" Maksad said, adding that until Saudi Arabia sees the change it wants, it has the luxury of time. Riyadh is however wary of striking a deal with the current Israeli cabinet, the most right-wing government in Israel's history, and one seen in the Arab world as responsible for the carnage in Gaza. Prince Khalid described the current Israeli attitude as one that is ""extreme,"" ""absolutist"" and uncompromising. ""The problem is not the occupied land, occupied by settlers. It is that the settlers have now occupied the Israeli government, and by that I mean the extremist settlers, the extremist settler mentality which is absolutist,"" Prince Khalid told the BBC, adding that the main obstacle to finding a resolution to the conflict is now Israel. Already, there are some strains between Israel and the UAE, the main Arab party to the Abraham Accords. The Gulf state, which held the rotating United Nations Security Council presidency twice over the past two years, introduced a draft resolution that was critical of Israel in December. A significantly watered-down Abu Dhabi is pressing for an end to the war and a return to the two-state solution as a pathway for peace. The war in Gaza is ""a turning point moment"" for the UAE, Lana Nusseibeh, its ambassador to the UN Without a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the UAE will not be ""as fully invested in the rebuild"" of Gaza, she said. ""That's not the trajectory we signed the Abraham Accords on,"" she said. Abu Dhabi has, however, indicated that it doesn't want the war to jeopardize relations with Israel. Anwar Gargash, the UAE president's diplomatic adviser, told a conference in Dubai this month that in recognizing Israel, ""the UAE has taken a strategic decision, and strategic decisions are long-term."" ""There is no doubt that any strategic decision will face multiple obstacles, and we're facing a major obstacle that must be dealt with,"" Gargash said, Shihabi, the Saudi analyst, said that his country's government ""is not interested in cosmetics,"" adding that a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel is ""the only card the US or anybody else has with Israel to encourage them to make concessions.""

They search for victims around them, and so they attack Erbil,"" Hussein said, adding that Iraqis are ""paying the price"" for Iran's tensions with Israel. At least four civilians were killed and six others injured in the attack, according to a statement early Tuesday by the Security Council of the Kurdistan region. A large villa belonging to a well-known Kurdish businessman was also destroyed, according to a CNN journalist in the region. There were unconfirmed reports of casualties at the residential property though it is not known if the building was an intended target. ""This blatant violation undermines the sovereignty of the Kurdistan Region and Iraq,"" the Security Council said in its statement, which accused Iran of employing baseless pretexts to attack Erbil, a historically stable region that it said had never posed a threat to any party. Also on Monday, the IRGC said it fired ballistic missiles at bases of ""anti-Iran terror groups in occupied territories of Syria."" It claimed the targets were involved in the recent ISIS In its statement, the IRGC said it ""identified and destroyed a number of key terror commanders and elements, especially Daesh (ISIS), in the occupied territories of Syria by firing a number of ballistic missiles."" A US official said Monday initial indications of Iran's missile attacks showed ""this was a reckless and imprecise set of strikes."" ""We have seen the reports, and we tracked the missiles, which impacted in northern Iraq and northern Syria. No US personnel or facilities were targeted,"" the official said. ""Iran is claiming this is in response to the terrorist attacks in Kerman, Iran, and Rask, Iran, with a focus on ISIS. We will continue to assess the situation."" An unnamed US State Department spokesperson told CNN the strikes did not damage the ""US Consulate Erbil or the New Consulate Compound under construction."" ""No American personnel were injured,"" they said. Kurdistan region Prime Minister Masrour Barzani called on ""our partners in the international community not to remain silent in the face of repeated attacks against the people of Kurdistan.""

""The way I am getting by is by begging here and there and taking help from anyone,"" said Abu Misbah, a 51-year-old building worker trying to support a family of 10. Vegetables and fruit were unaffordable, he said. His children asked for oranges, but he was not able to buy them. ""We never [been] through this situation before; we were a middle-class family,"" he said. ""Now since the war we are buying dates which we used to find everywhere for free. We want a solution to our miserable suffering."" He, like most others in blockaded Gaza, face what aid groups warn is a looming famine. The entire population of Gaza has already been classified in a state of crisis, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Israel closed its border with Gaza and launched an intensive bombing campaign in response to Hamas' October 7 attacks, followed by an ongoing ground invasion. The fighting has triggered a humanitarian crisis throughout the Palestinian territory, forcing thousands from their homes. This week Israel expanded its operation further into southern Khan Younis, warning residents to leave. But the United Nations says Gazans have nowhere safe to go. 'What kind of life is this?' Umm Omar, 50, is also displaced in Rafah, and lives in a tent with her family. During the truce, they had briefly returned home only to find all the windows and solar panels broken, and the kitchen destroyed. ""We are nine people in a tent of two meters by one meter,"" she said. ""We have bought this camping tent ourselves; no-one helped us or provided it."" Omar said they were getting by on canned food and estimated that most foods were at least four times as expensive as before the war. Medication is also hard to find. ""Life is difficult and humiliating; the word humiliating is not even close to describing it,"" she told CNN. Mahmoud Harara used to make a living selling produce from a cart. Now the 47-year old, from Al-Shujaiya, is also in Rafah, living with eight family members in the streets, including five school-age children. ""My house was destroyed and two of my sons injured from a strike of our home,"" he said. Like thousands of others, the family live in a makeshift tent made of nylon and roam the streets for food. They left home without any belongings and had no mattresses for the tent. Harara said his family was receiving no help, and the price of food was ""beyond imagination...Your child asks you for a piece of bread and you can't provide that for them. What kind of life is this?"" Harara said he walks three kilometers to a hospital to be able to use toilets. The lack of sanitation for the displaced now packed into parts of southern Gaza has led to the spread of contagious and respiratory diseases. It was also extremely difficult to access drinking water and his children were cold at nights, he said. None of the family had been able to take a shower in several weeks. Aid groups warn of famine conditions In recent days, crowds of civilians desperate for food have been seen surrounding aid trucks coming into Gaza. The United Nations has warned that the humanitarian situation in southern Gaza is deteriorating and warned that the volume of aid entering the enclave ""remains woefully inadequate."" The youngest children in Gaza face high risk of severe malnutrition and preventable death as the risk of famine conditions continues to increase, according to a The children's aid organization estimated that in the coming weeks, ""at least 10,000 children under five years will suffer the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, known as severe wasting, and will need therapeutic foods."" ""The threat of dying from hunger is already real"" for many families in Gaza, UNICEF added. An IPC report the same week found that that approximately all of Gaza's 2.2 million residents are now facing acute hunger and the entire population of the Gaza Strip is classified in a state of crisis - the highest share of people facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC initiative has ever classified. ""Many adults go hungry so children can eat,"" IPC reported, saying humanitarian access must be restored throughout the region to enable the rapid delivery of life-saving aid. The organization added that ""the IPC has emphasized that these conditions do not have to persist. Yesterday's warning of famine in the coming weeks and months can still be averted. But we must act now."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly said that a ceasefire is necessary to deliver aid to Gaza's population at scale, and has warned of a potential ""catastrophe with potentially irreversible consequences"" in the making. ""Amid constant bombardment by the Israel Defence Forces, and without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to break down soon due to the desperate situation, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible,"" he said.",'What kind of life is this?'

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/27/middleeast/iran-may-not-want-full-war-israel-mime-intl,"CNN A day after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its brutal attack on Israel, a curious video emerged out of Tehran's Azadi stadium. Hundreds of soccer fans, gathered to watch a match between Perspolis FC and Gol Gohar Sirjan FC, chanted in unison: ""Shove the Palestinian flag The vulgar protest came in response to officials attempting to raise a Palestinian flag in the stadium to show support for the October 7 attack. But for the fans, it was another unwelcome Hamas' attack, which Experts say that while Iran is wary of being dragged into the Israel-Hamas war, it may not be in full control if the militias it backs in the region independently intervene as Hamas suffers heavy blows and the death toll in Gaza continues to mount. ""What connects all these groups to Iran is their anti-Israel policies,"" said Sima Shine, head of the Iran program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, noting that while Iran has varying levels of influence over the groups, it doesn't dictate all their actions. In the early days after the October 7 attack, questions were raised about Despite its denial, however, Iran has ramped up its rhetoric against its arch enemy. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned that Israel's bombardment of Gaza could have far-reaching consequences, saying that if Israel does not halt its airstrikes, ""it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened."" ""This option is not ruled out and this is becoming increasingly more probable,"" he On Monday Abdollahian said the US has sent Iran two messages regarding escalation in the region. ""The first message said that He added that while the US says it wants to de-escalate, it has contradicted itself by continuing to support Israel. Proxies have 'their own strategic calculations' Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said there is no appetite or desire from either Iran, the US or Israel for a wider war, but that Washington's failure to restrain Israel may inadvertently drive the region towards escalation. US President Joe Biden last week pledged continued support for Israel, which has hardened Arab sentiment across the region and translated to mass protests against Israeli and American policies. ""The only actor that has a clear interest in (a wider conflict) is Hamas, given that an enlargement of the war could change the dynamics in a favorable way for them,"" Parsi said. In the absence of US efforts to rein in Israel, ""many (regional) actors are going to feel compelled to step in... because of their own strategic calculations."" ""When Israel is mobilizing 300,000 (troops), it is not likely that Hezbollah is going to sit there and assume that this is done only to go after Hamas,"" he said, adding that it will factor in the risk of Israel going after the Lebanese group as well. An Iran-backed armed group and powerful regional force, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel's military Israel's defense minister last week said that Israel was not interested in another war with Hezbollah. Israel has nonetheless turned the Hezbollah's influence spans beyond Lebanon, however. It also operates alongside Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria, where the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights separates Israel from Tehran-aligned fighters. The Lebanese group also has its own channels with Hamas. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah ""An assessment was made of...what the parties of the resistance axis must do at this sensitive stage to achieve a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine and to stop the treacherous and brutal aggression against our people,"" it said. The Hamas-Israel conflict has also led to skirmishes in Syria and Iraq, from which Iran-backed militias have launched multiple drone attacks on US forces. And the US now has specific intelligence that those same groups could escalate even further as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, The US continues to warn Tehran against taking advantage of the current situation or encouraging its proxies to escalate. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the United Nations Security Council to warn Iran against any further involvement. ""Tell Iran, tell its proxies in public, in private, through every means: Do not open another front against Israel in this conflict. Do not attack Israel's partners,"" Blinken said, noting that a ""broader conflict would be devastating, not only for Palestinians and Israelis, but for people across the region, and indeed, around the world."" The US on Thursday Shine, of the INSS, said that Iran does not want a direct war with Israel because that would mean a direct war with the US. ""It is very obvious that Iran does not want to be directly involved, and would prefer that (only) the proxies are involved."" But that may not play out exactly how Iran wants, added Shine, who previously served in the Israeli intelligence community for most of her career. ""Iran has to take into account that the world is not operating according to what Iran decides or wants,"" she told CNN. ""So, if they decide to use their proxies too much, they might find themselves in a war they don't want."" Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that the Iranian government is nonetheless preparing its population for war. Iranian media has been brimming with news of the Gaza war, with officials across Iran's political spectrum expressing solidarity with Palestinians. ""They're already preparing the public opinion for this eventuality by essentially trying to make the argument that this is something that is brought to their doorstep because of what the Israelis are doing and because of the American support for it,"" Parsi said. This shows there are already concerns in the Iranian government about how citizens will react to a war in which Iran is directly involved, he added. Even if there is a widener war that is still ""below the threshold of a direct US-Iran engagement"" - where it is restricted to Iranian proxies fighting Israel - it would still be an extremely unstable situation, he said. ""No one can even control the current situation and make sure it doesn't escalate."" ","Iran may not want a full-blown war with Israel, but it may be dragged into one"

The announcement from the Israel Defense Forces marked the biggest known withdrawal of troops from the territory since the war against Hamas began and comes after the military said it was expanding operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip. A senior US official said Monday that the move shows signs of the country's gradual shift to a lower-intensity phase of its war. The 551st and 14th brigades - comprised of reservists - will return to their families and civilian lives this week, the IDF said in a statement. The 828th brigade, which trains squad commanders; the 261st brigade, which trains army officers; and the 460th brigade, which trains the armored corps, will return to their scheduled training, the IDF said. The statement said the move is expected to ""significantly alleviate economic burdens"" and the troops ""to gather strength for upcoming activities in the next year, as the fighting will persist, and their services will still be needed."" In a briefing on Sunday, IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the return of the reservists was aimed at ensuring ""planning and preparation for the continuation of 2024... understanding that we will be required for additional tasks and warfare throughout this year.""

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel's war in Gaza is at its ""highest level and will continue for months,"" according to Israel's Army Radio. Senior US officials The US has been pressing Israeli officials to begin the more surgical phase of fighting. The Biden administration has warned Israel that it cannot replicate the kind of devastating tactics it used in the north and must do more to limit civilian casualties. More than 21,000 people have been killed in the enclave during Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. A US official said Monday's announcement appeared to reflect the start of a gradual shift to lower intensity operations in the north of Gaza that American officials had been encouraging. The official said the move reflected the success IDF forces have had in Northern Gaza in dismantling Hamas military capabilities. Still, the official cautioned there was still fighting ongoing in the north and that it did not appear to reflect any changes in the south of Gaza. US officials are viewing the next few weeks as a critical period that will demonstrate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's willingness to move to a lower intensity phase of going after Hamas in Gaza.

National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said a ""rocket barrage"" launched from Gaza into Israel on Tuesday morning ""proves once again that the occupation of the (Gaza) Strip is necessary for the realization of the combat goals."" The IDF said Monday that the 36th division, which comprises armored, engineering, and infantry companies, withdrew from the Gaza Strip after 80 days, in the most significant sign yet of a shift to a new phase of fighting that some Israeli officials have been promising. A growing chorus Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed at least Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday that the ""intensive manoeuvring stage"" of Israel's military offensive in northern and southern Gaza would ""end soon."" The Israeli military is working to ""eliminate pockets of resistance"" in northern Gaza, Gallant said, claiming: ""We will achieve this via raids, airstrikes, special operations and additional activities."" After the October 7 attacks, Gallant said the original plan was for the ""intensive manoeuvring stage"" of Israel's military campaign in Gaza to last approximately three months. But, he cautioned the Israeli military adapts its operations ""in accordance with the reality on the ground"" and ""our intelligence."" A spokesperson for the IDF told CNN the 36th division withdrew from Gaza ""for a period of refreshment and training,"" adding that the division's future movements are yet to be decided. ""At the end of the period, and according to the assessment of the situation, it will be decided on the continuation of the operational activity of the division's forces according to the operational need,"" the spokesperson added. The withdrawal means there are now three IDF combat divisions left in Gaza, alongside special forces, according to the spokesperson. The units still on the ground in Gaza include the 98th division, which is operating in central Gaza and is the biggest division ever created in the history of the IDF. The IDF does not comment on the number of its troops in Gaza, but every division comprises multiple brigades which can each include thousands of soldiers. Divides within Netanyahu's cabinet Ben Gvir's comments highlight the tensions that exist within the Israeli government, and the wider defense and security establishment, over how much of a presence Israel should retain inside Gaza after the war. Earlier this month, Israeli cabinet members The public spat on January 4 followed what one source described as a ""fight"" at a meeting of the the security cabinet. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said there had been a ""stormy discussion,"" while former Defense Minister Benny Gantz said a ""politically motivated attack"" had been launched. The security cabinet split was over how to handle investigations into the October 7  attack on Israel, including the Israeli military's failure to anticipate it, as well as how to approach the war from now on. If the government collapses, Israel would likely face new elections that Netanyahu is widely expected to lose. Meanwhile, some far-right politicians are pushing for complete re-occupation, along with the possible return of Jewish settlements, in the Gaza Strip.

""[The officer] noticed that I hadn't posted anything. Then she went to my WhatsApp... I had posted a verse from the Quran, and that turned out to be what they were after.

""The police say that any slogans in favor of Gaza or against the war mean supporting terrorism... even if you say that you are, of course, against people being murdered,"" Abeer Baker, a human rights lawyer representing some of the people who have been arrested, told CNN. The Israel Police said that as of October 25, it had arrested 110 people since the start of the war for allegedly inciting violence and terrorism, mostly on social media. Of these arrests, only 17 resulted in indictments. Most people were released without further charges, usually after a few days. Baker said the low number of indictments suggested that people were being arrested for making statements that are not illegal. ""People have been arrested for saying their heart was with the children in Gaza,"" Baker told CNN, pointing to a  The Israel Police says it is acting under Israel's Counter Terrorism Law. Article 24 of this However, Adalah, a non-governmental organization (NGO) that advocates for Arab rights in Israel said in a statement that these arrests are arbitrary and target Palestinians only. It said that many are carried out with brutal force in the middle of the night, and without proper legal justification. ""The criteria is not whether it's legal or not, the criteria is whether it makes people angry or whether it's something that is against the mainstream, we are not talking about the law. We are talking about atmosphere,"" Baker said, adding that discussing the context of the October 7 attacks is ""forbidden."" ""You cannot ask what can drive people to commit such horrible crimes. Can you ask who failed here? Why has Hamas succeeded? No,"" Baker said, pointing to numerous articles written in Israeli media that pose the same questions. ""They can do it. But if you're Palestinian, you cannot do this,"" the lawyer said. Responding to an earlier question from CNN on the general increase in arrests over social media posts, Israel Police said that while it ""firmly upholds the fundamental right to freedom of speech, it is imperative to address those who exploit this right to perilously incite violence."" One of the people Baker represents is Dalal Abu Amneh, a well-known Palestinian singer and neuroscientist who found herself arrested after turning to the police for help on October 16. She was receiving a large number of serious threats over a post on her Facebook and Instagram pages that included the Quranic phrase ""There is No victor but God"" and a Palestinian flag emoji. The police said the statement, was inciting terrorism and violence. Her lawyer said the statement was posted on Abu Amneh's Facebook and Instagram pages by her PR team and has since been deleted. Baker said the post, published late on October 7, after the Hamas terror attack and the first IDF strikes against Gaza, was meant as a ""reaction to the war on both sides."" Abu Amneh, who is 40, was held for two days, then released on bail on October 18 to house arrest, Baker told CNN. She has not been charged with any crime but has been banned from speaking about the war in Gaza for 45 days, Baker added. CNN has repeatedly asked the Israel Police for comment on Abu Amneh's case but has not received any response. Abu Amneh has spent the past two weeks holed up in her parent's house, even though her house arrest has ended. ""She is very afraid, she is scared of going back to her house,"" Baker said. ""People have put up Israeli flags around her house and made threats against her and shared where she lives on social media.""  Prominent Palestinian humanitarian lawyer Jawad Boulos told CNN the imprisonment of Palestinians, especially those who have not committed crimes, has been an important tool used by Israel in ""maintaining the occupation of Palestinians."" He said that ever since Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, Israeli authorities have made a ""concerted effort"" to silence Palestinians in the West Bank by imprisoning them. Boulos said that despite the odds being stacked against his clients in a court system ""not built to establish justice for the Palestinians,"" some prisoners were freed in the past. That, he said, is no longer an option. ""When arrests are done in this way... it's unfathomable,"" he told CNN. The Israeli State Attorney's Office said in a statement that ""there should be zero tolerance for those who publish - explicitly and even implicitly - expressions of support for the enemy and his criminal acts against the citizens of the country."" The State Attorney's Office has also made it easier for the police to open investigations into alleged instances of these acts, according to the statement. The crackdown is creating an atmosphere of fear among Palestinians. One Palestinian resident of Jerusalem, Yasser, told CNN he believed Palestinians could be arrested ""at any moment"" for what they post online related to Gaza, even if they express sympathy about a Palestinian child killed or injured after an Israeli airstrike. ""If I were to write about how airstrikes on Tel Aviv are bad, they probably wouldn't mind. But if I said airstrikes on Gaza are also bad, they will arrest me for it,"" he said. ""They are fighting on every front - online, in the streets, in the news, everywhere. No one is allowed to say a word. If you want to talk about the truth here, you're not allowed,"" Adli, another Palestinian resident of Jerusalem, told CNN. Both Adli and Yasser asked CNN not to publish their last names, due to concerns about the consequences of speaking to the media. Adli said he was feeling ashamed and embarrassed for not being able to express support for Palestinians in Gaza or denounce Israeli airstrikes. The risk of doing that was too high, he said. But the consequences of expressing sympathy with Gaza could soon become even more serious. Under current However, Israel's Minister of Justice Yariv Levin said last week that he and Minister of the Interior Moshe Arbel were looking into the possibility of widening the scope of the law to include the authority to revoke the citizenship of people who publicly support, incite or praise terror. At the same time, Israel's far-right minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has made it one of his priorities to combat what he calls incitement of terrorism online. He has established a taskforce focused specifically on incitement on social media and has led calls for a stricter approach to the issue. Ben-Gvir has been convicted in the past for inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism. Baker, the lawyer, said that some of the arrests, and Ben-Gvir's rhetoric, were an extreme reaction to the brutal Hamas attack. ""Israel is going through a trauma, a terrible trauma. But the law did not change even if we are in a tragic situation. The criteria of what is illegal is the same criteria. The reaction is extreme,"" Baker said. Fatina Abu Sneineh, Dua's mother, told CNN she was terrified when her daughter was taken. Dua has since been released on house arrest, with the police checking in on her multiple times a day, her mother said. ""She has been sick every day since she came home, she hasn't been able to eat,"" her mother added. The family said that after Dua was arrested, the police searched the house, turning it upside down.

More than 1.4 million people have been internally displaced in Gaza, the UN's humanitarian office OCHA said on Monday. Many civilians have been forced to flee to refugee camps or hospitals that have surpassed capacity, often living in unsanitary living conditions. The Al-Shifa hospital complex, she said, is overflowing with people, many of them women and girls sleeping on the floors of the hospital and outside, without access to physical or mental health care, water or privacy. ""Women are scattered all over the streets, all over the hospitals,"" Musleh said. ""I, personally, can't go to the bathroom more than twice a day... amid the crowding."" ""Some are lucky if they can get a chance to use a bathroom with some 40, 50 or 60 people needing to use it."" Musleh is one of hundreds of thousands of women in Gaza facing a desperate health crisis, since Israel's complete blockade of the strip curtailed critical reproductive supplies, including pregnancy, postpartum and menstruation products, as well as basic necessities like drinking water and food. Meanwhile, mothers say they are dealing with the desperate reality that they have no way to protect themselves, or their children, from Israel's relentless bombardment, which has struck residential areas, hospitals and schools. Israel's airstrikes have killed at least 9,155 people, according to figures released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawn from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. The vast majority of fatalities - 73% - are women, children and the elderly, according to the health ministry. Human rights groups say Israel's mass Shortages push women and hospitals treating them to the brink Reham Ahmed Al-Sadi had dreamed of having a baby girl. Now, nine months pregnant with her second child, she is preparing to give birth in a war zone, while trying to keep her family alive. In messages relayed to CNN by the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, the 28-year-old said she was terrified by all aspects of delivering a child amid the raging conflict: ""From preparing the baby's supplies and postpartum supplies, getting to the hospital during labor, and leaving the hospital safely after giving birth."" ""The war destroyed my joy about my pregnancy,"" she added. Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care doctor working with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, said rampant water, food and drug shortages have unleashed an ""avalanche of human suffering"" in Gazan hospitals. Medical staff in the strip are running out of essential supplies including gauze for wound care and external Rafah, the sole Without essential fuel supplies, and the bombardment ongoing, nearly half of hospitals are now out of service, the Palestinian health ministry said on Wednesday. In times of severe stress, women are more likely to miscarry or give birth prematurely, jeopardizing ""the survival of the baby,"" Haj-Hassan said. Diminished electricity supplies are a ""death sentence"" for patients who rely on medical equipment such as ventilators, or dialysis machines. Premature babies require incubators, breathing machines, and infusion pumps for recovery, all of which depend on electricity, she added. ""Without any of those things, those premature babies won't survive."" On Monday, the humanitarian agency CARE International Food shortages pose a threat to the health of the 283,000 children under the age of five as well as pregnant or lactating women, said Hiba Tibi, CARE West Bank and Gaza country director. Haj-Hassan said some of her colleagues in Gaza only have access to 33 milliliters (about 1.12 oz) of drinking water per day - a fraction of a cup - warning that thinning water supplies hamper mothers' abilities to breastfeed their babies or feed them formula. Amal, who was displaced from her home in Gaza City to Khan Younis in the south of the strip, is nine months pregnant and nervously awaiting what her birth might look like. ""What if I need a C-section? How will I give birth? There are no generators at the hospital. What if the remaining power goes off? What's more dangerous than this is that there is no anesthetic. There is no healthcare at hospitals. There is no sanitation,"" Amal, who asked that CNN not use her real name due to security concerns, said. Her next pressing concern: how to care for her child. Limited water stocks must be boiled over wood or old gas to become drinkable. ""You're lucky if you get a bucket filled with water,"" Amal said. ""[Mothers] are giving their babies adult milk. They boil it. Or (to feed babies), they crush some biscuits and add water to it, then stir them together. That's a meal."" Haj-Hassan said there is an outbreak of diarrheal disease, and respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, because people are sheltering in close living quarters. Eman Bashir, 32, said most of the children she knows, including her own, ""are suffering from diarrhea and vomiting."" The mother of three is in Khan Younis too, having been displaced from the north after the Israeli army's evacuation order. She added that she had heard of some women giving birth in schools because ""most hospitals are not operational."" Lack of reproductive supplies poses ripple effects From sexual health to menstruation, the conflict is impacting all aspects of women's health. Contraceptive products are in short supply, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) reported Barr warned that in crisis situations, rates of sexual violence are likely to increase ""because there is a feeling of impunity."" ""Women need sanitary products, they need sanitary towels, they need painkillers. Women are in great pain, they sleep on the floors, without mattresses,"" Bashir, the 32-year-old mother, told CNN. ""Most pharmacies have stopped working,"" Bashir added. ""Even the pills (used by women to stop their periods) are no longer enough. ""We have started regressing to the old ages, where women use pieces of cloth (during periods). Women cannot avoid facing their monthly periods in this situation."" Amal, the resident who was displaced to Khan Younis, said she has heard of many women using birth control pills to either stop or reduce the blood flow during menstruation. Those who do not, she said, use ""old methods, clothes that are washed."" Displaced women are likely to be in camps where a lack of clean and safe toilets, and reduced access to running water and privacy could lead to a spread in infections, including thrush, hepatitis B, and toxic shock syndrome, multiple relief workers told CNN. Nesma ElFar, the commercial director of MotherBeing, said that the Cairo-based health platform is working with the NGO Together For Tomorrow, to send more than 400,000 donations of sanitary products, including pads, reusable panties, wipes and diapers, to civilians in Gaza. She told CNN she received confirmation the products reached the Rafah crossing, but does not know when the aid will enter Gaza. 'Under fire, under death, under ethnic cleansing, under injustice' Palestinian mothers are balancing their own health care needs with caregiving responsibilities for their children, many of whom are affected by the psychological trauma Israel's bombardment has separated families and increased the fear of dying among children, Haj-Hassan said. She told CNN that one of her colleagues in Gaza relayed a story about a girl who ran in front of a car, about two weeks ago. ""When asked why, [the child] said, 'I just want to die. I can't deal with the fear of dying anymore,'"" Haj-Hassan added. She said medical workers use the term ""wounded child no surviving family,"" to describe children in Gaza who have been orphaned by war. So many aspects of motherhood, once routine, are now a matter of life or death. ""Every day, a sister and mother, a woman loses her husband, her father, her brother. These are the women of Palestine. These are the women of Gaza,"" said Musleh, the 50-year-old woman sheltering in Al-Shifa. ""We are under fire, under death, under ethnic cleansing, under injustice - under the injustice of the world, which sees with its eyes what is happening and is silent.""","In Gaza, being a mother is a matter of life and death"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/28/cars/hyundai-genesis-gv80-suv/index.html,"CNN Business Competing in the luxury car market without any SUVs in the lineup is like playing football without linemen. It's asking to get run over. That's why it was crucial for Hyundai's luxury brand, Genesis, to finally have its own SUV. The GV80 SUV, which made its US debut at an event in Miami Tuesday night, could be a game changer for the South Korea-based auto maker. Up until now, Genesis has offered only sedans, even as customers have been Today, Genesis sales are miniscule compared to these established luxury brands. Still, Mark Del Rosso, head of Genesis's North American operations, boasts that last year's sales doubled from the year before. That was largely thanks to sales of the new G70, an award-winning sporty sedan. After the new GV80, Del Rosso said, Genesis plans to soon add at least one more SUV to its ""I've learned to never ever underestimate Hyundai,"" said Sharon Silke Carty, editor-in-chief of Car and Driver. Hyundai has proven itself in the US market. In the most recent Consumer Reports auto reliability rankings Kia, which is also part of the Hyundai Motor Group, has followed a similar path. Genesis, too, has established itself with its lineup of strong cars, said Brian Moody, executive editor of ""You're never going to get to the place of big sales and marketplace recognition if you don't start with really good, compelling vehicles to begin with,"" said Moody, ""and at least they've done that."" The Genesis G70, in particular, has made an impact. A direct competitor to the performance sedans, like the BMW 3-series, it won both Genesis has taken great ""They're being extremely careful to make sure people don't feel its just a Hyundai or Kia with different styling,"" said Jake Fisher, head of auto testing for Consumer Reports. For instance, even though the Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade SUVs have been very well received, the GV80 is not related to them. While those SUVs are built around what is essentially front-wheel-drive engineering, the GV80 is based on real-wheel drive engineering, like the Genesis sedans. Also, like Genesis's other cars, the GV80 is designed to look more like a Bentley, noted Car and Driver's Carty. ""It looks kind of like a Bentayga,"" she said, referring to Bentley's SUV. It has a similarly large grille and side vents. Genesis's winged logo is also somewhat similar to Bentley's. Genesis vehicles do not come with Bentley prices, though, and the brand makes a strong appeal to value conscious consumers, said Fisher. Genesis cars are not exactly cheap, but they tend to cost considerably less than directly competitive German luxury models. (Genesis said the price of the GV80 will be revealed closer to when it goes on sale in the US this summer.) The interior, though, looks like the cabin of something far more expensive. It has clean lines, quilted leather and lots of shiny metal surfaces and wood trim. The new SUV also uses active sound deadening to quiet the interior. This involves using microphones to detect noise in the cabin then using the SUV speakers to generate sound waves that precisely cancel out the noise. The SUV will also have driver assistance features, like adaptive cruise control that will learn the driving tendencies of individual drivers. The SUV's twin sets of headlights --  which are in two separate strips -- will become a design signature for the brand. The GV80 is intended to become the brand's flagship product, said Del Rosso. ""The DNA is distinctly Korean, audacious, progressive etc.,"" he said. ""And I think the piece of it that I really, really love is that we can clearly differentiate on design."" For now, though, it's the brand's first entrant in a crowded field of SUVs from well-known luxury players. ""Let's be honest, it's going to be tough to build a brand from the ground up in that segment. I'm not saying they can't do it,"" said Moody. ""That's a lot of hard work for many, many years to come.""",New Genesis SUV could be a game changer for Hyundai's luxury brand
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/09/middleeast/gaza-orphan-british-doctor-jordan-king-intl-hnk,"CNN A British surgeon who led an emergency medical team in central Gaza says the situation at Al-Aqsa hospital has been ""beyond any doubt the worst thing"" he's seen in his career, as Jordan's monarch warned Israel's bombardment was creating an ""entire generation of orphans."" ""There's been multiple traumatic amputations of children ... horrific burns, the likes of which I've never seen before,"" Dr. Nick Maynard told CNN's Isa Soares on Monday after his team found themselves with no choice but to withdraw from the hospital, following increased Israeli military activity. He said that often ""there is no pain relief to give to these patients at all,"" underscoring the dire humanitarian situation and lack of medical supplies in the Palestinian enclave following more than three months of Israeli bombardment. ""I think it's fair to say I've never seen anything like this. And I never expect that in my life I would see such an appalling situation,"" said Maynard, who was speaking from the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Monday after leaving Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly said it is not targeting civilians. The IDF has also said that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as shields for its attacks on Israel, and that attacking those targets are essential as it works to eliminate Hamas from the enclave. Israel has also said some hospitals are being used as command centers but has provided limited evidence to support that claim. The IDF's operations are contentious, with humanitarian organizations warning that a growing number of medical facilities across Gaza are rendered unable to provide basic services. ""I've been going to Gaza for nearly 15 years now, I have many friends who work in hospitals there. There are many examples of hospitals being attacked. In the last two days since I left Al-Aqsa hospital, there have been attacks on the hospital,"" Maynard told CNN. The British surgeon had been in Gaza for two weeks, an experience he described as ""frightening,"" saying his team pulled out as the conflict came closer. ""There was an attack on the intensive care unit,"" he said. ""We were due to leave it about that time anyways but the following morning, the whole area was taken out of the de-confliction (zone), and we were told by the Israeli Defense Forces that we would not be able to go."" CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment but is yet to hear back. The doctor said his organization, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), and Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), were both operating at the hospital but ""both sets of foreign doctors had to leave."" MAP and the emergency medical team of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced their withdrawal from the Al-Aqsa Hospital on Sunday citing increasing Israeli military activity in the area. As Maynard and his team left Gaza for their safety, he fears that ""there are not enough staff to run the hospital in any form at all now."" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), warned Sunday that Al-Aqsa hospital was the ""most important hospital remaining"" in central Gaza. He demanded that medical staff and their families be protected, adding the facility ""must remain functional."" 'An entire generation of orphans' Israel's bombardment of Gaza began after Hamas launched its brutal October 7 assault in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians were killed and more than 200 people taken hostage. Since then, about At least 23,084 Palestinians have been killed and 58,926 others injured in Gaza since October 7, the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Monday. The Ministry of Health in Ramallah said that more than 5,300 of the dead are women and more than 9,000 were children. CNN is not able to independently verify numbers released by the two ministries. A separate statistic released by the international organization Save the Children said more than 10 children on average have Israel's military campaign has sparked an international outcry with a growing number of nations backing calls for a ceasefire. The United States has been pressuring Israeli officials in the last several weeks to do more to protect civilians and implement more strategic strikes but has so far resisted calls for a ceasefire. As deaths continue to climb, the conflict in Gaza has created ""an entire generation of orphans,"" King Abdullah II of Jordan said in a speech on Monday. ""More children have died in Gaza than in all other conflicts around the world this past year,"" Abdullah said according to the speech which was Abdullah's made his remarks during a visit to the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda's capital, according to Jordan's Petra news agency. ""How can indiscriminate aggression and shelling bring peace? How can they guarantee security, when they build on hatred?"" Abdullah asked. ""Without a just peace, on the basis of the two-state solution, the world will continue to pay a heavy price for failing to resolve this conflict, and we will never know true peace and stability in the Middle East,"" he warned. The speech in Rwanda came after Abdullah of Jordan met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Amman on Sunday, where the two ""agreed to continue close coordination for sustained humanitarian assistance"" in Gaza, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Sunday. Abdullah also warned Blinken of the ""catastrophic consequences of the continuing war in Gaza,"" according to a palace statement released after their meeting.","British surgeon says Gaza 'beyond worst thing' he's seen, as Jordan's king warns Israel creating a 'generation of orphans'"

Scientists recently found a possible mechanism for that increased risk - some air pollution particles Given the significant health risk, the Though it's stronger than previous standards, the EPA proposal falls short of the WHO recommendation. Harold Wimmer, the president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said the proposal ""misses the mark and is inadequate to protect public health.""

He also noted that a stronger rule is needed for the average daily limit - from the current 35 micrograms per cubic meter to 25. The EPA said it is taking public comment that potential change. Wimmer said health organizations are ""united"" on this ask. EPA Administrator Michael Regan defended the proposed rule, and said was crafted after ""a lot of time looking at all of the new science"" and after consultation with the experts within EPA ""as well as our stakeholders.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/19/middleeast/hezbollah-explainer-intl,"CNN Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East. The group, which has its main base on the Israel-Lebanon border, could become a wildcard player in the The conflict that started with Hamas' deadly attacks on Israel - which Israeli officials say killed 1,400 people - has already had broad ramifications in the Middle East, and triggered diplomatic rifts and protests around the world. Following the attacks on October 7, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed more than 5,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. The fallout is palpable on the Here's what else to know about Hezbollah. The origins of the group Hezbollah emerged from the rubble of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, when Israeli forces took almost half of Lebanon's territory. This included Beirut, where Israeli forces, along with right-wing Israel-allied Christian Lebanese militias, laid siege to the western part of the capital to drive out Palestinian militants. Israel's operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to Estimates for the number of deaths at Sabra and Shatila vary between 700 and 3,000. As droves of Palestinian fighters left Lebanon, a band of Shia Islamist fighters trained by the nascent Islamic Republic of Iran burst onto Lebanon's fractious political landscape. The rag-tag group had an outsized and violent impact. In 1983, two suicide bombers linked to the faction attacked a US marine barracks in Beirut, killing almost 300 US and French personnel, and some civilians. A year later, Iran-linked fighters bombed the US Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people. In 1985, those militants coalesced more formally around a newly founded organization: Hezbollah. The group made no secret about its ideological allegiance to Tehran and received a steady flow of funds from the Islamic Republic. This helped propel Hezbollah to prominence. It became a participant in Lebanon's civil war, which ended in 1990, and led a fight against Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon, ultimately driving them out in 2000. A terror designation In Lebanon, Hezbollah is officially considered a ""resistance"" group tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Yet much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization, largely since Argentina blamed the group for the 1992 attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people, and the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center, killing 85, also in the capital. Both Iran and Hezbollah denied responsibility for those attacks. In 2011, the pro-democracy Arab Spring protests spiraled into proxy wars that spread through much of the Middle East. Hezbollah was an active participant, fighting alongside Iran-aligned forces in Syria and Iraq. Soon after, it was also designated a terror organization by several Arab countries. But that barely dented the group's power. During the years-long proxy battles, it experienced a meteoric rise, evolving from guerrilla insurgents into a regional fighting force. How Hezbollah relates to Hamas Hezbollah and Hamas haven't always seen eye to eye. The two Islamist groups fought on opposing sides of Syria's uprising-turned-civil war with Hezbollah fighting on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad while Hamas militants supported the predominantly Sunni opposition. Hezbollah is a group from the Shia branch of Islam, while Hamas is Sunni. When the Syrian war wound down in most parts of the country toward the end of the last decade, Hamas and Hezbollah set their differences aside. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly praised the growing alliance between the two groups. Hamas' leaders have met with Nasrallah several times over the last year, and the Gaza-based group's deepening connections with Tehran are widely known. A growing regional power isolated at home While Hezbollah fought battles further afield, troubles began brewing on their home turf in Lebanon. Repeated cycles of economic and political crises over the last two decades have dealt a blow to the group's popularity outside of its Shia support base. The group became beleaguered by wider economic problems that it proved powerless to address. It served as a bulwark against Lebanese protests demanding change from a political elite widely accused of corruption, and even dispatched supporters to beat peaceful demonstrators. Hezbollah has also been largely successful in quashing a judicial investigation into the Beirut port blast that laid waste to large parts of the city in August 2020. But that may prove immaterial to the group's goals. Hezbollah is arguably Iran's most effective non-state partner. And while its regional influence expands, it may only become a more formidable nemesis to its long-time foe, Israel. Why Hezbollah could become embroiled in the Hamas-Israel war It is still unclear whether Hezbollah will intervene in the Hamas-Israel war on behalf of the Palestinians. On the one hand, it shares Hamas' ultimate goal of destroying the Jewish state. On the other, Hezbollah has everything to lose. Israel remains the most sophisticated army in the Middle East by far, boasting some of the most advanced weapons in the world, with US support. Moreover, its war with Gaza offers a cautionary tale. In response to Hamas' wide-scale and lethal surprise terror attack, Israel has killed more Gazans than it has in any other war with the blockaded coastal strip. This has sent a chilling message to Lebanon, still reeling from the devastating economic crisis of 2019, which has left much of the nation in disrepair. Israel may also be hesitant to try its luck with the Iran-backed group. A war with Hezbollah in Israel's north could ignite a third front in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which separates Israel from Iran-aligned forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military. While Hezbollah's arsenal may be no match for Israel's, it does boast precision guided missiles, which are far more sophisticated than the shoddy Soviet-era rockets they used in their most recent conflict with Israel in 2006. Nasrallah claims his forces consist of more than 100,000 units, comprising active fighters and reservists. Should Hezbollah get involved in the war, it would open up a multifront conflict, propelling the Middle East into uncharted territory with unpredictable consequences.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/26/politics/us-strikes-facilities-syria,"CNN The US carried out airstrikes targeting two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria on Thursday, according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, following a series of drone and rocket attacks against US forces in the region. The US assessed that the airstrikes against the facilities linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated groups did not result in any casualties, according to a Friday statement from Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. The strikes, carried out by an F-15 fighter jet and a pair of F-16 fighter jets using precision-guided munitions, targeted a weapons and ammunition storage facility in Abu Kamal near the border between Syria and Iraq. The strikes destroyed the facilities, according to Ryder. Austin on Thursday described the strikes, which were ordered by Biden sent a letter to Congress on Friday evening detailing what he called ""necessary and proportionate"" strikes, writing that they ""were intended to establish deterrence and were conducted in a manner to limit the risk of escalation and avoid civilian casualties."" ""I directed the strikes in order to protect and defend our personnel, to degrade and disrupt the ongoing series of attacks against the United States and our partners, and to deter Iran and Iran-backed militia groups from conducting or supporting further attacks on United States personnel and facilities,"" Biden wrote. The two targeted facilities had been previously occupied by members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated militia groups, a senior military official said. ""We know that there were people on the target at various points during the day,"" the official said during a briefing with reporters following the attack, emphasizing: ""Again, we know that they were not civilians. The people that occupy these locations are Iranian-aligned militia groups as well as IRGC personnel."" A senior defense official called Iran ""the center of gravity"" for the attacks on US forces in the region, saying that ""Iranian fingerprints are all over this."" ""Tehran and Iranian senior leaders are funding, arming, equipping, training and directing a whole plethora of militia groups across the region, and they have escalated attacks against US forces since October 17, which is why we took self-defense action tonight,"" the official said. The Biden administration has Earlier Thursday, the US announced it is deploying The US strikes follow a growing number of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17. As of Thursday evening, when the Syria strikes were announced, On Friday, the US military shot down a one-way attack drone near Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq, according to a US defense official. It marked the 20th attack and the first since the US announced it had carried out the strikes in Syria. ""At approximately 0700 EDT on 27 October, US forces engaged a one-way attack drone a few kilometers from Al-Assad Air Base, Iraq, and successfully shot it down without further incident,"" the official said. On Wednesday, Biden issued a strong warning to Iran about its proxies attacking US forces in the region. ""My warning to the ayatollah was that if they continued to move against those troops, we will respond, and they should be prepared."" Biden also said the presence of US troops in Iraq and Syria is focused on the campaign to defeat ISIS and is not related to the ongoing conflict in Israel. But Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian did not attempt to tamp down the tensions Thursday at an emergency session of the UN General Assembly, stating that the US ""will not be spared from this fire"" if the war in Gaza doesn't end. Earlier this week, the minister had said that Iran had received two messages from the US, though he would not say how or when the messages were delivered. The first message said the US was not interested in a wider expansion of the conflict, he said, while the second urged Iran and its partners to have self-restraint. The last known US strike against Iranian-backed militias in the region occurred in March, when the military struck a facility it said was used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It followed a similar series of drone and rocket attacks against US facilities in the region. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Thursday that the US ""will always reserve the right to self-defense"" and that if the US chooses to retaliate for the drone and rocket attacks, it would be ""at a time and place of our choosing."" In the face of an increased threat of attack, the Defense Department is rushing additional air defenses to the Middle East.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/15/success/nissan-ariya-electric-suv-reveal/index.html,"CNN Business The Nissan Ariya, the company's first all-electric SUV, will be able to drive up to 300 miles on a single charge and features a high-tech interior, with almost no buttons or knobs, according to the automaker. The vehicle was unveiled during an online event Wednesday. Nissan became one of the first major car companies to offer an all-electric car when it introduced the Leaf in 2010. At the time, Nissan had big plans So far, things haven't turned out the way. Last year, electric vehicles made up just 2.6% of all cars sold globally, according to the International Energy Agency. Besides a new and improved Leaf, the only other electric vehicle Nissan offers widely is the eNV, a plug-in version of the Nissan NV van, which isn't sold in the U.S. Nissan executives have said the company will come out with The Ariya crossover SUV will become Nissan's second electric vehicle available in the US. It's bigger and roomier than the Leaf, a compact car, and has a design somewhat like Nissan's Murano SUV. The most noticeable difference is the front ""grille"" design. Electric cars don't require nearly as much incoming air as gasoline-powered car, so the front grille is purely a design feature. The Ariya's grille has a large sunken area with a subtle pattern that's supposed to resemble a traditional Japanese kumiko design. It also has a slightly redesigned Nissan logo that lights up. Inside, the Ariya has a particularly roomy interior thanks to the lack of an engine under the hood. Things that usually impinge on interior space, like the air conditioning equipment, are located under the hood instead. In place of buttons and switches most so-called secondary controls - for things like climate control and the stereo - are handled through ""capacitive haptic switches,touch-sensitive icons that light up on the dashboard. The Ariya's large flat battery pack is mounted under the SUV's floor, which allows the vehicle to have a completely flat floor, an arrangement also found in a number of other electric models including the Tesla Model Y. The Ariya will be available with Nissan's ProPilot Assist driver assistance technology that The electric SUV will be available in front- or all-wheel-drive and with a choice of two battery pack sizes. The base model will have a 63 kilowatt-hour battery pack. The Ariya will be able to go from a stop to 60 miles an hour in about 5 seconds, Nissan chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta said in an online meeting with journalists. That performance is similar to Nissan's 370Z sports car. The Ariya will go on sale in Japan in the middle of 2021 and in thnited States later next year. Prices in the US will start at about $40,000. That's a few thousand dollars less than competitors like the","Nissan unveils its first electric SUV, the Ariya"
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/23/politics/iranian-militias-israel-hamas,"CNN The US has intelligence that Iranian-backed militia groups The militia groups have already launched multiple drone attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria. But the There are ""red lights flashing everywhere,"" a US official in the region told CNN. Officials said that at this point, Iran appears to be encouraging the groups rather than explicitly directing them. One official said Iran is providing guidance to the militia groups that they will not be punished - by not getting resupplied with weaponry, for example - if they continue to attack US or Israeli targets. On Monday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said there is ""a very direct connection between these groups"" and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and he said the US is ""deeply concerned about the potential of any significant escalation of these attacks in the days ahead."" A senior defense official echoed that concern on Monday. ""We see a prospect for much more significant escalation against US forces and personnel in the near term,"" the official said. ""And let's be clear about it. The road leads back to Iran. Iran funds, arms, equips and trains militias and proxy forces all across the region. ... We are preparing for this escalation, both in terms of defending our forces and being prepared to respond decisively."" Iran supports a number of proxy militia groups in countries across the region through the IRGC-Quds Force, and Tehran does not always exert perfect command and control over these groups. How willing those groups are to act independently is a ""persistent intelligence gap,"" noted one source. But, Kirby said, ""we know that Iran is closely monitoring these events and in some cases, actively facilitating attacks and spurring on others who may want to exploit the conflict for their own good,"" he said. ""Iran's goal is to maintain some plausible deniability here, but we are not going to allow them to do that."" Asked by CNN on Monday whether Iran is directing the groups, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, ""Whether they're directing them or they're not, these are militias that they have sponsored and they're responsible for."" A senior State Department official separately told CNN that the US and its partners are ""all on the same page that sending a clear message to Iran - that it should not seek to take advantage of the situation and groups that are under its control or influence should not seek to take advantage of this either,"" and if Tehran does so, ""that could have very escalatory and dire consequences."" ""It's not just a US message; it's a shared message,"" the official said. Qatar has been a key intermediary between the US and its allies and Iran, multiple officials told CNN. In the case of the recent drone attacks on bases housing US forces, ""Iran is certainly more culpable than in the case of the Hamas attack in Israel,"" said another person familiar with the intelligence. CNN previously reported that Iranian government officials appeared caught off guard by the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. Iranian proxy forces have attacked bases housing US troops in the past, and the US has responded with airstrikes against the groups' infrastructure, including as recently as March. But another source said that right now, the Iranians' ""appetite for expanding [the conflict] is high. Their risk tolerance is high."" The US, meanwhile, is actively bolstering its defenses in light of the heightened threats. The US has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and around 900 in Syria as part of the anti-ISIS coalition, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement over the weekend that he was deploying additional air defense systems to the region in response to ""recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces"" across the Middle East. Those include a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system and additional Patriot batteries. Two drones targeting US forces in Syria were shot down on Monday, and troops in Iraq and Syria faced three separate drone attacks last week from suspected Iranian proxy groups, the Pentagon confirmed. Last Thursday, a US Navy warship operating off the coast of Yemen intercepted multiple missiles fired by Iranian-backed Houthi militants that appeared to be heading toward Israel. In Tehran, there does not appear to be a clear consensus about what approach to take to the war between Israel and Hamas. ""I am sure there are different voices in their system advocating different things,"" the senior State Department official said. Another official said that while it is unlikely that Iran would be willing to engage in direct fighting with Israel or the US, directing proxies to attack US assets in the Middle East allows Iran to maintain their influence and reputation while managing escalation risks. In a news conference with his South African counterpart Naledi Pandor in Tehran on Sunday, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said that the Middle East is like a ""powder keg,"" according to quotes published by state-aligned Tasnim news. ""Any miscalculation in continuing genocide and forced displacement can have serious and bitter consequences, both in the region and for the warmongers,"" Abdollahian said, referring to the US and Israel. The Iranian foreign minister also warned the US and Israel that ""if crimes against humanity do not stop immediately, there is the possibility at any moment that the region will go out of control."" ""We're concerned about potential escalation,"" Austin said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""In fact, what we're seeing is a - is a prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region, and because of that, we're going to do what's necessary to make sure that our troops are in the right - in a good position, and they're protected, and that we have the ability to respond.""",Intelligence shows Iranian-backed militias are ready to ramp up their attacks against US forces in the Middle East
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/01/middleeast/israel-court-judicial-overhaul-intl,"CNN Israel's Supreme Court on Monday struck down The court ruled, by eight votes to seven, that a government amendment to the so-called reasonableness law should not stand. The bill had stripped the Supreme Court of the power to declare government decisions unreasonable, and was the first major piece of a multipronged effort to weaken the judiciary to be passed by the Knesset, Israel's parliament, last year. The verdict reopened an emotional and heated debate that had raged in Israel throughout 2023 but was sidelined following Netanyahu's next moves will be watched closely by all sides, with the threat of a constitutional crisis looming should he attempt to push ahead with the controversial change. In its ruling, the court said it rejected the amendment because it would deal a ""severe and unprecedented blow to the core characteristics of the State of Israel as a democratic state."" The law, which came into effect after it was passed in July, took away the court's power to veto government decisions based on them being ""unreasonable."" Vast swathes of Israel's population opposed the change, according to opinion polls, which critics said would erode the independence of the courts and harm Israel's democracy. Its passage caused huge protests - a regular sight in Israel's cities since Netanyahu unveiled his judiciary agenda - and prompted thousands of army reservists to Among those opposing the plans were the two fellow members of Netanyahu's war cabinet. Yoav Gallant, the minister of defense, became the first member of Netanyahu's pre-war cabinet to publicly oppose his plans in March, leading to his temporary dismissal before he was reinstated. And Benny Gantz, the leader of Israel's opposition National Unity party, led protests against the efforts earlier in the year. Following the verdict Monday, Gantz said the court's decision ""must be respected."" ""These are not days for political arguments, there are no winners and losers today. Today we have only one common goal - to win the war together,"" he said. ""After the war, we will be required to regulate the relationship between the authorities and enact a basic law that will also anchor the status of the basic laws."" Israel's allies, including the United States, have previously Netanyahu's allies criticized the court's decision Monday. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called the ruling ""illegal,"" saying it was harming Israeli forces fighting in Gaza. ""This is a dangerous, anti-democratic event - and at this time, above all, a ruling that harms Israel's war effort against its enemies,"" Ben-Gvir said. Minister of Justice Yariv Levin, the architect of the judicial overhaul plans, called it ""the opposite of the spirit of unity required these days for the success of our fighters on the front."" The Israeli prime minister's Likud party said the ruling was ""unfortunate"" as it ""is against the will of the people for unity, especially during wartime."" Opposition leader Yair Lapid said in a post on X that the Supreme Court had his full backing as it ""faithfully fulfilled its role in protecting the citizens of Israel."" ""If the Israeli government again starts the quarrel over the Supreme Court then they have learned nothing,"" he said. ""They didn't learn anything on October 7, they didn't learn anything from 87 days of war for our home."" Reasonableness doctrine The reasonableness doctrine is not unique to Israel's judiciary. The principle is used in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The standard is commonly used by courts there to determine the constitutionality or lawfulness of a given piece of legislation, and allows judges to make sure that decisions made by public officials are ""reasonable."" The prime minister and his supporters have argued that the Supreme Court has become an insular, elitist group that does not represent the Israeli people. They say it has overstepped its role, getting into issues it should not rule on, and the proposed changes would correct that trend. But critics say Netanyahu pushed the overhaul forward to protect himself from his own corruption trial, where he faces charges of The government bill amended one of Israel's Basic Laws, which, in the absence of a formal constitution, act as an informal one. Until Monday's ruling, the Supreme Court had never before struck down a Basic Law or an amendment to one. In their ruling, 12 out of the 15 judges agreed that the court had the authority to nullify a Basic Law in ""extreme cases."" Only eight of the 12 thought this was an extreme case. The debates over Netanyahu's efforts were paused on October 7, with Hamas' attacks on Israel prompting the formation of a war cabinet and seemingly suspending the back-and-forth of Israel's sharply divided politics. But on December 29, a leak of a draft document that pointed to Monday's ruling caused the issue to reemerge. Reacting to the leak, Minister of Justice Levin claimed that ""citizens of Israel expect the Supreme Court not to publish during a war a ruling that is controversial even among its judges."" The speaker of the Knesset, Amir Ohana, added that ""a time of war is certainly not the time to establish a first precedent of its kind in the history of the country."" But the Supreme Court was required to release its ruling by January 12, as two justices hearing the case have retired and are required by law to submit their final rulings within three months of stepping down.","Israel's top court strikes down key part of judicial overhaul, reigniting divisions as war rages"

The kingdom proposed an "" ""For us, the Palestinian issue is very important. We need to solve that part,"" MBS said, adding that he wants to see Israel as a ""player in the Middle East."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin MBS said that if a deal is reached with Israel, his country is willing to work with US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu on Wednesday met for the first time since the prime minister returned to office last December. A senior US official told CNN Wednesday that the two leaders discussed normalization efforts ""in some depth."" ""We have made some progress, but it's difficult and there's some ways to travel with us before we get there,"" the official said, adding that ""it's obvious that a move like this by Saudi Arabia will require a component dealing with the fundamental between Israelis and Palestinians."" Asked by Fox News' Bret Baier what concessions Israel would have to give Palestinians for Riyadh to agree on a deal, MBS declined to answer, saying ""these are part of the negotiations."" If Iran gets a nuclear bomb, 'we have to get one' MBS also sought to strike a conciliatory tone on Iran during the interview, saying Tehran had been taking the issue of mending ties with his country ""very seriously."" ""They are doing their best, so we are investing in that,"" MBS said, adding that the kingdom wanted to see Iran progress. MBS however drew a line at Iran's potential procurement of a nuclear weapon, reiterating his previous threat that it would force the kingdom to pursue the bomb. ""If they get one, we have to get one,"" MBS said. ""But we don't want to see that."" The regional archrivals ended nearly eight years of hostility in a landmark deal to reestablish diplomatic ties that was mediated by China in March. MBS told Fox that the kingdom did not choose China to broker the agreement, but that Beijing had ""chosen"" to do it. Saudi Arabia has been strengthening its ties with China as Washington's rivalry with the Asian nation heats up. During the interview, the crown prince also made a veiled threat to the White House, suggesting that the kingdom could seek other security partners if the US does not meet its requirements as part of the Israeli normalization talks. Riyadh is seeking concessions from the US in exchange for its potential recognition of Israel in the form of security guarantees and help with its civilian nuclear program, CNN has reported. Gulf states including Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been concerned about what they perceive as waning US interest in their security, fears the White House has repeatedly sought to dispel. ""They don't want to see Saudi Arabia shifting their armament from America to another place,"" MBS said. ""We are the biggest buyer of American armored manufacturing,"" he said, adding that Saudi Arabia is ""critical"" to US arms exports.

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/13/middleeast/houthis-iran-us-strikes-war-intl,"CNN The stakes in the Middle East have rarely been higher. Simmering tensions reached new levels on Friday when the The strikes risk further fanning the flames of a wider regionaI conflict that neither the US nor the Houthis' backers in Iran appear to want. Since Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel and the Israeli offensive in Gaza that followed, Iran's so-called axis of resistance -- a network of Shia militias that span four Middle Eastern countries -- has been activated from one end of the region to the other.  It has been a relatively low-rumbling tit-for-tat that has stayed just below the threshold of a full-blown regional war. And it has sharpened US President Joe Biden's Iran's network of armed groups have coalesced around a single stated goal: bringing about a ceasefire in Gaza, where the staggering civilian death toll and wide-scale devastation wrought by Israel's assault has led to allegations of genocide at the United Nations' top court (claims Israel has strenuously denied). It has been a risky venture for which each of the armed groups have paid a hefty price. In Lebanon, Hezbollah has lost nearly 200 fighters since October 8. In Iraq, US strikes have dealt major blows to the infrastructure of Iranian-backed fighters. In Yemen, the damage wrought by the deadly strikes on Thursday is not yet clear, but the US and the UK say they have targeted positions used by the Houthis to launch attacks on the Red Sea, potentially weakening the group's stranglehold over the shipping route. ""These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea - including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history,"" Biden said in a statement. ""These attacks have endangered US personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardized trade, and threatened freedom of navigation."" But the escalation in violence has also brought gains to Iran's proxies, as well as their backers in Tehran. The ""It is clear that the Houthis were grabbing the opportunity of the current war to go through a quite effective rebranding exercise,"" said Rym Momtaz, Consultant Research Fellow for European Foreign Policy and Security, transforming them There are other tactical gains beyond their boosted In Lebanon, the border flareup seems to have turned the country's devastating economic crisis, and the role Hezbollah has played in fuelling it, into a distant memory. With Israel on the backfoot in its border area with Lebanon, from which the vast majority of its residents have fled, Hezbollah has been empowered to push for a negotiated settlement where it aims to retrieve slivers of Israeli-controlled territories claimed by Lebanon. In Iraq, the revived attacks on US troops - and the US' retaliatory strikes on Iranian-backed groups - have prompted the government to renew a push to end America's military presence in the country But stoking tensions only benefits Iran up to a certain point. If these relatively low-level confrontations eventually escalate into all-out war with the US, Tehran's paramilitary partners could face decimation. ""The Iranians are trying to stay out of a war. Their population absolutely does not want a war,"" said Trita Parsi, Executive Vice President of the DC-based Quincy Institute. ""I think they would find themselves in a very similar situation to (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, which is that if there is a war, there will be a rallying around their country and not their leadership."" Parsi warns against downplaying the importance of a ceasefire in Gaza bringing about a de-escalation in the region. The Biden administration, according to Parsi, is ""trying to walk a fine balance in which they maximize the maneuverability of Israel without it leading to a regional war."" ""As long as the war in Gaza goes on, that war is what is fuelling the Houthi attacks, the militia attacks, as well as the tensions between Lebanon and Israel,"" said Parsi, adding that the Houthis temporarily stopped their attacks on the Red Sea during a six-day truce between Hamas and Israel in November. Meanwhile, the escalation is likely to persist, even as both the US and Iran-backed actors seek to calibrate their confrontations and pray that it doesn't spiral. The clashes will also continue to give Tehran leverage, argues IISS's Momtaz, as evidenced by the strikes in Yemen on Thursday. ""That is a strategic challenge that the US is dealing with now,"" said Momtaz. ""They need to restore freedom of navigation and secure international trade in the Red Sea while continuing to make sure that the other fronts don't escalate into a real war.""","A wider war doesn't suit Iran, even as it benefits from rising tensions"

Speaking at the Al-Monitor and Semafor Global Summit, the UAE official however stressed the importance of cementing that involvement so ""that there are no vacuums"" - which, he warned, would only ""give opportunities for other players to move into."" It is important to move from an ""informal"" security arrangement ""to something that's formal,"" he said at a conference in New York, calling for a new, ""ironclad"" security arrangement with the US. The demand for a formal arrangement that would offer Gulf states a security umbrella and bind the US to protecting them in the face of military attacks has become an essential component in ties with the US. Gulf states have over the past few years ""Only a substantive security commitment by the United States would be perceived by regional adversaries as a deterrent to their ambitions to topple the U.S.-led regional order of which Saudi Arabia is the anchor,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst, A security pact is at the heart of Saudi Arabia's talks with Washington over potential normalization of ties with Israel - which, if achieved, would mark a significant foreign policy win for President Joe Biden ahead of the 2024 US presidential elections. Last month, MBS for the first time publicly acknowledged the normalization talks, saying his country was moving ""closer"" each day to reaching a deal with Israel. What a security pact could look like Experts say the Gulf states may be disappointed as the US is unlikely to extend a blanket security agreement that could get it further bogged down in the Middle East's conflicts and require a cumbersome legislative approval process in a Congress where Saudi Arabia remains unpopular due to its human rights record. Discussions over the potential agreement have not been made public, but experts have put forward a number of ideas, from treaties that recognize Gulf security as part of US national interest, to declaring the Gulf nations Major Non-NATO Allies, to a formal security commitment from the US such as those signed with Japan and South Korea. The US entered defense treaties with The Major Non-NATO Ally status is a US designation that provides partners with defense trade and security cooperation benefits. While it is seen as symbol of close partnership with some military and economic privileges, it doesn't entail Among the Gulf states, Bahrain, which hosts the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, was the first to be declared a MNNA in 2002. Qatar, which is home to the US Central Command, was added to the list last year. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are likely asking for a comprehensive treaty, similar to that signed with Japan and South Korea, said Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute of the National University of Singapore and author of "" They may also be asking that Washington ease access to arms sales and potentially increase the US military presence in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, he added, potentially to match the presence in Qatar or Bahrain. It is however unclear if the US would commit to a treaty that would require it to come to the Gulf states' defense in case of attack. ""This can only be conferred through a Senate-ratified treaty,"" said David Des Roches, a professor at the Near East South Asia Center for Security Studies and former Pentagon official who worked on the Middle East. ""In the absence of a true breakthrough (such as Saudi recognition of Israel), it's hard to see the Biden administration presenting any treaty, even a weaker commitment... to the Senate,"" Des Roches told CNN. The president can offer some concessions without Senate ratification, he said, but that won't meet Gulf states' requirements. ""The Saudis and others have seen how a non-treaty arrangement can be undone,"" he said, referring to the Gulf perception that the US is disengaging from the region. ""(They) are unlikely to be satisfied with anything short of a binding treaty commitment."" Between oversight and autonomy Some experts say that any agreement with the US will necessarily impact Gulf states' autonomy over their own defense affairs, as the Biden administration is likely to ask for guarantees that its Arab allies reduce engagement with rivals like China and Russia, both of whom have bolstered ties with the Gulf states of late. The UAE in 2021 suspended a Asked if the UAE is still interested in procuring F-35 jets from the US, Gargash last month Des Roches said that with a new security pact, the US is likely to ask the Gulf states to ""curtail the fielding of any Chinese technology which has the potential to compromise US weaponry in service with Gulf countries."" But Gulf states, he said, ""are likely to regard such restrictions as an infringement on their sovereignty."" Nevertheless, said Samaan, the demand for a new security arrangement with the US shows that Washington remains the Gulf states' first port of call when it comes to security matters, despite the threats about finding alternatives. ""We're back to business as usual,"" he said, where Gulf states are turning to Washington and asking for bigger security packages - even if recent public rhetoric has shown some disconnect between what those states will publicly say and what they really want.",Biden's Gulf allies want an 'ironclad' security pact with the US.

Residents of Gaza are told to ""please pay attention and check this map,"" while following ""instructions of the IDF through various media outlets."" However, CNN analysis shows that IDF instructions have - at times - been imprecise and confusing. Regular IDF updates highlight numbered blocks in orange, urging citizens to evacuate these locations, and move to other areas labeled on the map. But some of the messaging has been contradictory and concerns have also been raised over Palestinians' capacity to access the information due to power and telecommunication outages. Using videos and images shared online, satellite imagery and local news reports, CNN has verified three Israeli strikes on areas where citizens were told to flee. ""Since the beginning of the fighting, the IDF has been imploring the civilian population to temporarily evacuate from areas of intense fighting, to safer areas, in order to minimize the risk posed by remaining in areas of intense hostilities,"" the IDF said in a statement in response to CNN's reporting. The IDF also claimed that they struck the areas identified in this report after ""intelligence indication that these places were safehouses for commanders of the Rafah Brigade of the Hamas terror organization."" ""The IDF continues to operate against Hamas infrastructure and terrorists wherever they are located in the Gaza Strip,"" the statement continued. Strikes in areas civilians directed to On December 2, the IDF's spokesperson for Arab media, Avichay Adraee Multiple images of the same location were shared - each with different locations highlighted. On the map, areas to the north and east of the city of Khan Younis are highlighted orange, and arrows instruct residents to evacuate from these areas to Al-Mawasi - a 5.22 square mile coastal strip designated a safe zone by the IDF - or to Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city. Aid organizations have raised concerns regarding the Al-Mawasi ""humanitarian zone,"" with the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Director-General Meanwhile, analysis shows, strikes continued to hit Rafah. In the three days after Adraee's post, three Israeli strikes targeted locations in Rafah, CNN has found, despite IDF advice stating Gazans should evacuate ""to Rafah."" On the afternoon of December 3, a strike took place in Rafah's El-Geneina neighborhood. Footage, filmed moments after the attack, shows a large smoke plume rising from a location close to Saddam Street in Rafah. Photographs and videos shared on social media, and geolocated to a position matching the plume, show a large Local media reported at least 17 people were killed and dozens injured in the attack, which struck the home of the al-Bawab family. Later that night, another airstrike hit the home of the Al-Jazzar family in the Al-Tanour neighborhood of Rafah. Footage captured in the aftermath of the attack shows individuals desperately searching for survivors in the wreckage. One video shows a man, his legs trapped under rubble, being rescued by Civil Defense teams. CNN geolocated the footage to a house in Rafah's Al-Tanour neighborhood and confirmed the strike using satellite imagery. Journalists in the area told CNN that 18 people were killed in the bombing - among them were journalist Shaima Al-Jazzar and her family. CNN has not been able to independently verify the casualties. CNN was also able to verify reports from the following evening, December 4, that an Israeli strike targeted a public water tower less than 400 meters from the Al-Jazzar family home. Through analysis of satellite imagery, it is possible to confirm the water tower was destroyed between December 3 and 9. There were also reports of at least three other airstrikes on locations in Rafah on December 2, 3 and 5 but CNN was not able to independently verify these attacks. Confusing messaging about safe zones The IDF also issued contradictory messages in the north of Gaza which could have led people wrongly to believe they were in safe areas, CNN analysis shows. On December 2, Adraee Adraee attached two This created confusing messaging where certain ""blocks"" were simultaneously presented as ""safe"" and ""unsafe."" For example, block 720 is not highlighted in the first image, but appears in the orange area in the second image. Block 717, which is partly highlighted in the first image, appears squarely in the orange zone in the second image. Adraee published updated advice on December 3 in which only the image showing the wider shaded area was included. CNN has verified two Israeli strikes which occurred inside blocks which were not highlighted in the first version of the image - so according to its guidance should have been safe - after Adraee shared the contradictory evacuation orders. On the evening of December 3, a The video is shot at night, making it hard to detect any significant landmarks. However, reports also claimed that the petrol station was located next to offices of the Palestinian Civil Defense. With this information, CNN was able to locate a Civil Defense office and a petrol station side-by-side in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood. Satellite imagery of the area - provided by Planet Labs on December 4 - reveals destruction and clear signs of fire at the location of the petrol station, located in block 720, an area that was not highlighted in one of the posted maps. The Palestinian Civil Defense later released a On the same day, local reports claimed that the Al-Salam Mosque in the Al-Tuffah neighborhood had been targeted by Israeli strikes. Satellite imagery of the area does not reveal clear damage to the mosque, but there are signs of bombing in the surrounding area. Although it has not been possible to confirm the exact date of this attack - which hit block 717 - satellite imagery analysis reveals the strike took place between December 2 and 9, in the days following Adraee's post correcting initial map. The IDF says that the maps are reflective of a commitment to ensuring ""all possible precautions to avoid causing loss of civilian life or injury, adopting all available means.""

On the way, she saw refugees being struck by Israeli jets ""just meters away,"" She hugged her son ""so we'd die together."" Khulood eventually made it to the southern city of Khan Younis, but she is now surviving on ""a dry piece of bread,"" as the territory faces a food shortage and no electricity or running water. ""I don't know if the bread will be available tomorrow,"" she said. Around 50,000 women in Gaza are pregnant, 10% of whom are expected to give birth in the coming month, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Those women face a ""double nightmare"" after a ""horrifying week"" of Israeli airstrikes, Dominic Allen, the UNFPA's Representative for the State of Palestine, told CNN Sunday. Gaza residents have faced Israeli airstrikes in several rounds of conflict over the past few years. Between October 7 and 12, Israel dropped 6,000 bombs on the enclave - that's equivalent to the total number of airstrikes on Gaza during the entire 2014 Gaza-Israel conflict, which lasted 50 days. It now appears to be preparing for a ground operation into the enclave. Israel has also imposed what it calls a ""complete siege"" on the territory, blocking supplies of water, electricity, goods and fuel. Human rights organizations have Many Gazans have heeded Israel's call to evacuate from northern Gaza, with hundreds of thousands making their way south. But moving Some have been worried about the safety of the escape routes. CNN has geolocated and authenticated videos from the scene of a large explosion on Friday along a route to south. Fear of what the future holds Nardeen Fares is nine months pregnant with her first child. Following the call by the Israeli military for civilians to flee the 27-year-old traveled Friday with her husband from the al-Rimal neighborhood in Gaza City to Khan Younis - roughly 16 miles away or a 40-minute drive. With her due date rapidly approaching, Fares says she fears what the future holds. ""Right now, there is an exodus... half of the Gaza Strip is moving to Khan Younis,"" Fares told CNN Friday by phone, adding that she is now sharing a 6-bedroom dwelling with more than 80 other people. ""As a woman who is in her last month of pregnancy, God knows when it will happen and what the situation will be like then,"" Fares said. ""Bombardment, no bombardment, you don't know what will happen then."" She's concerned that hospitals in Khan Younis won't be equipped to treat her if she goes into labor given the sheer number of people that are descending on the city. Khan Younis had a population of just over 400,000 before the war. Given the city's proximity to the Egyptian border, it's the destination of choice for many of those fleeing the north. Israel on Sunday said that 500,000 residents are estimated to have left northern Gaza for the south. Ten members of a single family were killed Monday after an Israeli airstrike hit Al Kizan neighborhood, doctors in the city's Nasser Hospital told CNN, adding that 23 other people had been injured. She says she has heard that hospitals in the city are barely operational and medical services are ""almost gone"" amid a fuel shortage. The World Health Organization warned last week that the health system in the entire strip is at a breaking point, adding that the impact would be devastating for the most vulnerable patients, including the injured who need lifesaving surgery, patients in intensive care units, and newborns depending on care in incubators. Allen of the UNFPA said pregnant women in Gaza are ""facing unthinkable challenges,"" saying the stories he has heard coming out of Gaza's are ""harrowing."" ""Imagine going through that process in those final stages and your last trimester before giving birth, with possible complications, without clothing, without hygiene, support, and not sure about what the next day, next hour, next minute will bring for themselves and for their unborn child,"" Allen said. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) 'Brink of famine' Mona Ashour, seven months pregnant, has stayed in the north of the Strip, but not by choice. Her family doesn't have the financial means to travel south, she said in messages relayed to CNN by her cousin Hashem Al-Saudi, adding that even if they could travel, the family of four has no one to stay with in the south. Ashour has reduced her nutrition to the bare minimum as food and water supplies dwindle due to Israel's blockade. She knows this could be affecting her unborn child, and that's causing her a lot of stress. Ashour has two daughters, and the family lives in a house that has a makeshift roof made of tin panels, leaving them exposed to shrapnel from potential Israeli missiles. ""I need a lot of nutritional supplements,"" she said, adding that her husband, who used to work on a daily wage before the war, cannot afford them anymore. The Palestinian Authority's media office said Monday that Gaza is ""on the brink of a real famine as goods in stores are running out, and no aid is coming in,"" adding that over half a million people have been displaced in the enclave. Relief groups and the UN are calling for aid to get into Gaza, some of which has arrived in Egypt's north Sinai but is yet to cross into Gaza through the Egypt-controlled Rafah crossing. After meeting the Egyptian president amid a whistle-stop tour of the region, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the crossing - which is the sole remaining route into or out of Gaza - ""will be open."" He didn't say when. Over the weekend, concrete slabs were placed at the Egyptian side of the crossing, blocking all gates, a Palestinian border official told CNN Saturday. On Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said there has been no progress in efforts to open the crossing, and blamed Israel for its continued closure. Khulood, who fled northern Gaza, said she won't know where to go when it's time for her to give birth. ""I'm scared. For my son, my unborn child and myself,"" she told CNN. ""I don't want to die.

https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/business/motor-trend-car-of-the-year/index.html,"CNN Business Fiat Chrysler Automobiles stole the show at this year's MotorTrend Car, Truck and SUV of the Year Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. Sergio Marchionne, the former head of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles who died earlier this year, was honored as Person of the Year while two of Fiat Chrysler's products -- the Ram 1500 pickup and the Jeep Wrangler -- earned Truck of the Year and SUV of the Year Awards at the event. The Car of the Year Award was given to the new Genesis G70, a compact luxury performance sedan from Hyundai's newly created luxury division. The magazine's writers lauded Marchionne's leadership of both Fiat and Chrysler, noting how he turned each company around as they approached the brink and combined them to create a new industry powerhouse. He was also remembered for his keen and demanding eye for products. The magazine noted Marchionne's reputation for making designers and engineers rework their designs over and over until he felt they were right. His demanding approach was evidenced in the two products that won awards this year, as well as in the Alfa Romeo Giulia which was named Car of the Year Last Year, according to the magazine. Only vehicles that are completely or substantially redesigned for the model year are eligible for these awards. The vehicles are tested side-by-side, then judged based on six criteria: safety, efficiency, value, advancement in design, engineering excellence, and performance of intended function. The Ram Truck was tested at Fiat Chrysler's own Arizona proving grounds where temperatures regularly reached ""well into triple digits,"" according to the magazine. MotorTrend's editors were impressed with the truck's ride quality, thanks to its sophisticated suspension, as well as its nicely appointed interior with tools and storage bins for a variety of uses. Also, its unique mild-hybrid system aids both fuel economy and performance, the magazine noted. The Ram beat General Motors' new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks, both of which were finalists, for the award. Trucks are huge profit makers for these companies and the fight for buyers can be fierce. A head-to-head win against GM's best new trucks gives the Ram pickup real bragging rights that will doubtless be put to good marketing use. ""It's huge for Ram to win, but when you drive the product and test it like we did, it wasn't close at all,"" said MotorTrend editor-in-chief Ed Loh. The Jeep Wrangler, while also a completely new design, retains the unmistakable Wrangler look dating back 70 years to the original military Jeeps. The new Wrangler provides a better on- and off-road ride and steering characteristics, the magazine noted, without sacrificing any capability. Like the Ram, it's also available with a new mild hybrid system that uses batteries to store excess power that can be used to assist with acceleration. The Wrangler is the most famous product from what is generally regarded as Fiat Chrysler's most valuable brand by far -- especially after Ferrari was spun off as a separate company. The Wrangler is central to Jeep's image for rugged off-road performance. Engineers and designers were faced with the challenge of staying true to that while making the new Wrangler as palatable as possible for those who drive it regularly on paved roads and highways. The new Wrangler is good enough that it actually makes a perfectly viable daily-use alternative to a more car-like crossover SUV, said Loh. Hyundai's winner, the Genesis G70, is intended to compete directly against compact luxury performance cars like the BMW 3-series and Audi A4.  It marks the first time a Korean brand has won the Car of the Year award. Hyundai and its corporate sibling Kia have made great strides in recent years in improving the driving enjoyment of their cars. Now, they can credibly take on the best German brands, said Loh. ""It hits all the right notes: Punchy powertrains and an agile chassis that's a ton of fun, sporty exterior styling with strong graphics, and a well-appointed interior,"" said MotorTrend international bureau chief Angus MacKenzie.",Fiat Chrysler steals the show at MotorTrend Car of the Year Awards
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/17/cars/automaker-car-loan-deals/index.html,"CNN Faced with plunging demand and a country in lockdown, automakers are offering never-before-seen deals to A number of car companies, including Fiat Chrysler With loans that long and no interest at all, monthly car payments can be very low. That's assuming, of course, your credit score is good enough to qualify. But, experts warn, don't get so fixated on that very enticing interest rate that you forget to consider all your options. It may not be the best deal for you. Consider the risks There are some risks with taking these very long car loans. The main one: That you'll still be making payments long after the new car smell has gotten lost behind a forest of cardboard pine tree air fresheners. You might not like the car so much by then, even if you loved it when you bought it. Also, your needs might change, said Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with Autotrader.com. A lot can happen in seven years. ""If you're going to buy a small car how would you know what your life is going to be like in that amount of time,"" she said. You might need a bigger car, maybe even an SUV or minivan, before then. Also, new cars with fancy new technologies could start to look appealing a few years down the line. Maybe you want to go electric some time before 2027. Then there's a fundamental math problem. The longer you stretch out your loan, the longer you'll be ""underwater"" on your new car. That means you will owe more money on the car than the car is worth. All new vehicles lose value the minute you purchase them. The drop in value is steepest at the beginning - right after it changes from a new vehicle into a used vehicle - then tapers off to a gradual decline over the years. The amount you owe on the vehicle, on other hand, declines at the same rate each month as you make each payment. With a longer loan and smaller payments, that slope will be shallower. That increases the amount of time during which you'll owe more money than your car is worth. ""It puts the transaction in a bit of a negative light in terms of 'Oh man, I've got this car and it's not even worth as much as my loan',"" said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com. ""It's just not a good feeling."" If you're happy with your car or crossover and plan to keep driving it, that's not really a problem. It's only a problem if your needs change or you just want to get a different car. Instead of having a trade-in that will help you pay for that new car, you'll be trading in a rolling mound of debt. Any car dealer will be happy to bundle the remaining balance into your new car loan. That will, of course, make your next round of new car payments bigger. Consider all your alternatives Keep in mind, 0% If your credit score is good enough to qualify for a zero-interest loan, it's almost certainly good enough to qualify for other low-interest loans. Before you start shopping, check what kind of interest rate you could Also, don't assume you'll qualify for one of those Finally, don't forget to negotiate the price of your new car or truck. Sometimes car shoppers get so dazzled by a headline-making deal that they forget to haggle on the price of the car. Dealers have a strong incentive to clear out the cars on their lots, said Tyson Jominy, an industry analyst with J.D. Power and Associates. Before the coronavirus lockdowns started, dealers had, on average, about an 80-day supply of inventory. Each of those vehicles that sits unsold costs a dealer about five dollars a day in interest, he said. Just be careful not to rush into a decision, said Jeff Bartlett, an automotive editor with Consumer Reports. It's a long term purchase so make sure you're clear on what the future holds for you.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/22/world/air-pollution-climate-change-health/index.html,"CNN New air quality guidelines published on Wednesday by the World Health Organization could prevent millions of deaths globally each year, the UN agency said. Fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream and can contribute to asthma, cardiovascular disease and other respiratory illnesses. The In 2016, around 4.1 million premature deaths -- more than half of the total deaths attributable to air quality issues -- were associated with fine particulate matter. If the new 2021 air quality guidelines had been applied then, there could have been a nearly 80% reduction in PM 2.5-related premature deaths, or 3.3 million fewer deaths, according to the UN agency. The guidelines, which are designed to help governments craft air quality regulations, also include other major health and climate-damaging pollutants, both outdoor and indoor, such as PM 10 -- particulate matter larger than PM 2.5 -- as well as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. The report comes as world leaders meet in New York for the ""These guidelines reinforce the need for urgent action that would benefit the health of all, including vulnerable populations,"" Jarosinska told CNN. ""This creates a triple-win scenario for the benefit of air quality, climate action and health, and is one of the elements postulated by WHO Manifesto for a healthy recovery from Covid-19."" The latest guidelines also support recent research that found air pollution is most likely a contributing factor to health burden caused by Covid-19. Fine particulate matter comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, wildfires and agriculture, and is linked to a number of health complications including People with these underlying medical conditions are at greater risk of developing the most severe outcomes from Covid-19 infection, the research showed. Researchers have already seen a particularly strong connection between the rise in Covid-19 cases and air pollution from wildfires. A Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who studied the health impacts of wildfire smoke, said the new guidelines could have been more ambitious than just reducing air quality threshold levels, calling the scope of the new update ""a bit underwhelming."" ""There are a lot of evidence that's been produced in the last few years showing that even at the lowest levels of air pollution, including PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide, there is still a huge impact at the population level,"" Benmarhnia told CNN. Global assessments of ambient air pollution alone suggest hundreds of millions of healthy years of life lost, with low and middle-income countries the hardest hit. Still, many countries don't meet the WHO's recommended guidelines. In India, where the air in vast parts of the country is often clogged by smoke from industries, recent research showed people could achieve In the US, people of color and low-income communities suffer disproportionately from air pollution. A These same communities also face the greatest impacts of the climate crisis. Some air pollutants including methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- as well as the components of soot and urban smog are short-lived climate pollutants, which have been linked to the near-term warming of the planet. They are described as ""short-lived"" because they persist in the atmosphere for as little as a few days to months. Despite this, Benmarhnia said the new guidelines could have widened the scope and included more types of sources of emissions in the context of tackling the climate crisis. Still, he adds it gives governments an opportunity to identify more pollution sources and push for more robust policies on their own based on these guidelines. ""This is just one tool, among many others, and it should not be taken for granted,"" he said. ""It should be some kind of advocacy tool to show that we need to reduce more and more exposure to air pollution."" The new guidelines reflect the conclusions of the major ""Much of air pollution comes from the same sources that are driving climate change, mainly from burning of fossil fuels,"" Jarosinska said. ""Therefore, addressing air pollution goes hand in hand with the global climate action -- efforts to improve air quality will contribute to climate change mitigation. In turn, climate change mitigation efforts also improve air quality."" With clearer insights on pollution or emissions sources, WHO is also calling on world leaders to phase out fossil fuels, particularly coal and biomass-fuel combustion. The disparities in air pollution exposure have been stark and are increasing worldwide due to large-scale urbanization and economic development that has recently been largely reliant on burning fossil fuels unsuitable for the planet. And as the world's top leaders gather in the chambers of the UN General Assembly this week to address the warming planet ahead of the critical UN climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, the new air quality guidelines underscore the need for countries to rapidly reduce emissions for healthier air and to mitigate the climate crisis. Benmarhnia said it's also important for leaders to note that the new update is not a ""one size fits all"" solution since countries are not made equal in terms of air quality and the different climate disasters they face. ""Registering inequalities in terms of exposure but also in terms of susceptibility impacts associated with air pollution is important,"" he said. ""Hopefully, the next guidelines will be a little bit more comprehensive in taking into account the heterogeneity of sources of emission and the composition of particulate matter in the context of climate change.""","Millions of deaths could be avoided under new air quality guidelines, WHO says"

Black carbon -- the dark, dusty pollution that comes from Take bright, white snow and sprinkle some black pollution on it, and it's a recipe for melting. And ""(Antarctica) is currently one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet,"" said Alia Khan, a snow and ice scientist at Western Washington University. ""Snow is already melting due to impacts of climate change, but this is an exacerbating factor on snow melt."" The researchers sampled snow around tourist sites and research-heavy locations from 2016 to 2020 and found the black carbon found in those samples was considerably more abundant than levels measured elsewhere on the continent. The research found the highest levels of soot were measured near the Argentine research station in Hope Bay on the Trinity Peninsula, near the northern most part of Antarctica. ""(Tourist) ships in Antarctica generally use less-polluting marine diesel, and some vessels are supplementing fuel with battery power,"" the study said. But the researchers note that their results show there's more to be done to reduce pollution as tourism continues to increase. Roughly 74,000 tourists visited Antarctica during the summer of 2019-2020, the researchers reported, a 32% increase from 2018-2019 and more than twice as many as a decade ago. Khan said this study was important not just to understand what's happening in Antarctica, but because global climate models -- which scientists use to predict environmental changes decades and centuries in advance -- need a better grasp on the impact of snow albedo on the climate system. ""The snow albedo effect is one of the largest uncertainties in regional and global climate modeling right now,"" Khan told CNN. ""That's one of the motivations for the study, to quantify the impact of black carbon in Antarctica due to local emissions from research and tourist activities on regional snowmelt, which is important for quantifying the role of black carbon in the global loss of snow and ice."" Marilyn Raphael, a geography professor and director of UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, explained that messing with the Antarctic could throw our planet's delicate balance out of whack. ""[Antarctica] is sitting there pretty much silently all year. But, if it weren't there, in the state that it is meant to be, the balance that we have in the climate system -- the balance that we enjoy in the Northern Hemisphere -- will no longer be,"" Raphael said. Tuesday's study comes alongside an alarming record in Antarctica: the area of ocean covered by sea ice around the continent will Antarctica's sea ice is also important to maintain a balance in atmospheric circulation, Raphael said. This circulation drives the winds and is the means by which energy is transported into or out of the continent. ""If the atmospheric circulation changes, the global climate changes,"" she said. As waters get warmer and sea ice depletes, some Antarctic creatures are finding their homes more and more unlivable. Penguin colonies in Antarctica, for example, rely heavily on krill in their diets, and the krill rely on sea ice. Scientists have seen a ""Everything we do has consequences,"" Raphael said. ""We need to educate ourselves about those consequences, especially in systems that we know relatively little about. We have to be careful that we don't upset the climate balance.""

News agency WAFA also reported his death and that of his family. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were not aware of their forces operating where Hattab and his family were killed. ""Based on a review of operations in the area, the IDF is not aware of any military activity conducted by our forces in the vicinity of the location in question,"" the IDF said in a statement to CNN Saturday. CNN could not independently confirm the source of the blast at the house. Palestine TV has not published evidence linking it directly to an Israeli strike. Hattab's death sent shockwaves through his newsroom, with Palestine TV journalist Salman Al Bashir making an emotional on-air report that reduced a television anchor to tears. ""We can't bear this anymore. We are exhausted, we are here victims and martyrs awaiting our deaths, we are dying one after the other and no one cares about us or the large scale catastrophe and the crime in Gaza,"" he said.

The strikes began after Hamas militants rampaged through Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 Israelis and capturing over 220 hostages. Israeli warplanes have since hit large residential areas, schools, and hospitals in Gaza, sparking outcry in the region and beyond. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has repeatedly told Gazans to move to the south of the enclave, but that area has also been pummeled with deadly strikes.

Shoppers can search inventories and test drives are usually much more generous than you'll find at typical used car dealers. Hertz will even bring the car to you for a test drive if you live within 75 miles of one of their rental locations. Shoppers can also ""rent to own"" a car. But is the car in good shape? The idea of buying a used rental car makes some people uneasy. The car may have had a brutal life. Renters have little incentive to treat a car gently, the thinking goes. Rental cars also often drive more miles in a year than cars owned or leased by an individual. On the other hand, rental car companies have an incentive to maintain the cars well to preserve as much value in them as possible and to make sure their customers don't have issues with them. Potential buyers should take advantage of the long try-out periods to get the car inspected by a mechanic and make sure it has no hidden issues, said Jon Linkov, an editor with Consumer Reports. Rental companies do offer ""certified"" used car programs and promise thorough inspections. But it's still always better to get an independent inspection, Linkov said. Shoppers should also He also recommends buying from one of the major rental car companies rather than a smaller operation. That's because smaller rental car companies may be selling cars that were already used when they bought them. Check out your financing options Shoppers should also research their financing options before buying, Linkov said. Again, that's always a good practice regardless of where you're buying the car. The rental companies often have good financing options for customers with excellent credit - Avis, for instance, is offering 0% down and no payments for 45 days - but you might do even better on your own Hertz and Avis Budget Group did not return requests seeking answers to specific questions about their operations.",Want to buy a used car?

The nation is a military partner of the US, having served alongside American forces six times, and has been the recipient of some of the most advanced weaponry Washington has sold in the Middle East. Dubbed the The drill is the latest in A UAE official told CNN Monday that ""such joint exercises are part of the UAE's ongoing efforts to strengthen international cooperation across various fields"" and ""are designed to support efforts to enhance international peace and stability."" The UAE holds joint and multilateral training exercises ""with various international partners across the world, including with countries in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and Asia,"" the official added. ""Relations with China serve as a useful signaling device for the US,"" Hasan Alhasan, a research fellow for Middle East Policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told CNN. ""To communicate to the US that the defense and security partnership might not be meeting their expectations."" But there is a ""triangular dynamic"" to the Gulf-China-US relationship, he said, adding that it is unlikely that Gulf states are oblivious to the ""second-order ramifications"" of their growing ties with China, referring to the possibility of upsetting Washington. The Chinese ministry of foreign affairs told CNN Tuesday that Beijing was developing ""mutually beneficial and cooperative relations with Middle Eastern countries"" and would ""not seek geopolitical interests."" ""We have no intention to fill a so-called 'vacuum'. And we will not build exclusive circles,"" the ministry said, adding that China ""will continue to develop friendly relations in all fields with Middle Eastern countries"" as well as ""play a positive and constructive role in promoting peace and stability"" in the region. Obama's pivot to Asia Experts say that China first saw an opportunity in the Middle East during former US President Barack Obama's For Saudi Arabia and the UAE, those fears materialized when they each faced The perceived security vacuum left by the US ""created an opening that was not there before,"" said Mohammed Baharoon, director general of the Dubai Public Policy Research Center, known as B'huth. China's growing presence in the Middle East, he added, is a ""direct response to the growing significance of the region, and lack of viable solutions"" to the Gulf's security concerns. The US' strategy to alienate Iran over 30 years, he said, didn't pay any dividends. The Gulf states were incapable of filling the vacuum on their own, so they became more autonomous and began relying on China, John Calabrese, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told CNN. ""The perception among those countries, (is) that the United States has been either unable or unwilling... to fulfill its declared commitments to serve as the security guarantor,"" Calabrese said. Saudi Arabia has been keen to note that the US isn't its only international partner. Asked by CNN's Becky Anderson in October whether the kingdom was siding with Russia in its war with Ukraine, Saudi ambassador to the US, Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, said the government has a policy of engaging with "" Washington has denied that it is pulling back from the Middle East and has affirmed its commitment to helping protect its allies, especially from Iran and its proxies. Saudi Arabia may be putting that commitment to the test now. It is now reportedly demanding that the Biden administration extend security guarantees in the form of a formal agreement in exchange for Riyadh recognizing Israel. Alhasan said that Saudi Arabia will likely factor in a possible change in the US administration next year before ""striking any grand bargain"" with Washington, over fears that it might be discarded upon the arrival of a new government. A global arms player China's wish to become a global arms player is no secret. President Xi Jinping has said that building a strong military is a key component of the nation's new era of ""rejuvenation."" The US is watching closely. But analysts say it will take time for Beijing to challenge both US technology and military outreach, especially in the Middle East where it has traditionally played a small military role. ""China presents an alternative and an option (for Gulf states),"" Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, told CNN. ""China is interested in challenging and undermining US traditional influence in the region, but it does not have either the capacity or the willingness to replace the US in the region,"" she said. The US and Europe remain the Middle East's top arms suppliers. Four of the top 10 importers of US arms are Gulf Arab states: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE. But Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also made purchases from China. Last year, China and Saudi Arabia agreed to co-manufacture drones locally in the kingdom. The UAE has bought advanced trainer jets from China. Some of these purchases were driven by ""The point is that Gulf states are interested in diversifying and localizing their defense procurements,"" Alhasan said, even if there is a ""baseline preference for US equipment."" The cost of ties with China With the Gulf states' increasing engagement with China, it remains to be seen how willing they are to provoke Washington and what price they'd accept to abandon the budding ties with Beijing. The relationship has a twofold function for Gulf states, analysts say. It allows them to benefit economically, diplomatically and militarily, while building leverage with a US that is anxious about China's growing influence in the region. But not everyone agrees that ties with China are up for negotiation. ""This is not a honeymoon,"" Baharoon said, adding that there will neither be a ""marriage"" nor a ""divorce"" between the Gulf states and China. ""However, the partnership with China is growing and expanding... it continues to be economically dominant."" Saudi Arabia and the UAE, he said, aren't bound by the ""ideological polarity"" of the US-China relationship, adding that it would not be in their interest to join a pact against China, Russia or Iran. Sun of the Stimson Center said that China and Gulf states ""have shared goals and agendas beyond the US."" ""Even without the US, China will remain a key buyer of Gulf oil and a critical economic partner,"" she said.

Ramping up security guarantees for Saudi Arabia would likely face stiff resistance from some members of Congress, who have called on the Biden administration to downgrade Washington's relationship with Riyadh. Still, President Joe Biden has placed importance on normalizing ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, as has Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who believe better relations between the two nations could help increase security in the Middle East.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/18/business/ford-electric-mustang-mach-e-hands-free-driving/index.html,"CNN Owners of Ford's Mustang Mach-E electric SUV will be able to add hands-free highway driving technology to their vehicles late next year. In SUVs with this technology, drivers will be able to remove their hands from the steering wheel and pull their feet away from the brake and gas pedals while the vehicle essentially drives itself on selected major highways. The Mach-E will go on sale later this year, and the hardware to enable hands-free driving will be offered as an option. The software to enable the functionality, called Active Drive Assist, will be sold separately by the fall of 2021, Ford said. Drivers will either be able to install it at home through a download or at a Ford dealership. Ford had announced the Mach-E would eventually have this capability The hands-free driving functionality will be very similar to Drivers have a tendency to ""over-trust"" these sorts of driver assistance technologies and stop paying attention after about seven minutes of using a system like this, said Darren Palmer, Ford's director of electric vehicles. That makes driver monitoring technology important. No data will be stored from the driver monitoring camera, he said. It will be used only for moment-to-moment monitoring of the direction of the driver's gaze. Ford's Active Drive Assist is different from Tesla's Autopilot technology because Autopilot is not designed to allow drivers to let go of the steering wheel for long periods. The Tesla system also does not have a driver monitoring camera. Instead, Autopilot relies on sensing at least a slight tug from the driver's hand on the steering wheel to indicate that the driver is involved in driving. If the Tesla system does not sense a hand on the steering wheel for a period of time, Autopilot will stop working. In 2018, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took legal action against a company that sold Many other automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW and Nissan, offer systems generally similar to Tesla Autopilot that also do not encourage drivers to remove their hands from the steering wheel. Ford's Active Drive Assist system will not execute highway lane changes, according to Ford. That is something that Tesla's and some other systems can do and that GM has announced future Super Cruise systems will be able to do. The Active Drive Assist system will work on more than 100,000 miles of divided highways in the United States and Canada, the company said. The system can be updated to allow use on more miles of highway over time. The system incorporates various driver assistance technologies, such as adaptive cruise control, which automatically follows traffic ahead at a set distance, and automatic lane keeping, Ford said. The driver will be alerted when he or she enters a highway on which the system can work. The status of the various driver assistance systems, including Active Driver Assist, will be indicated in the narrow computer screen directly in front of the driver which serves as the gauge cluster. Engineers carefully researched how to clearly indicate to drivers the status of the systems, Ford executives said. Once the system is engaged, drivers will be able to immediately take back driving control by just using the steering wheel, said Chris Billman, director of customer experience for Ford's drive assistance technologies. ""We wanted to make sure you could take over without making it feel like you're wrestling control from the car,"" he said. Some other systems, like Tesla's Autopilot, require a firm tug in the steering wheel to return control to the driver. Ford did not provide pricing information for the hardware or software. The company plans to make the technology available on other Ford models later, executives said.",Ford's electric Mustang will offer hands-free driving technology next year
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/09/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-war-explained-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN The Israeli military has told all civilians in Gaza City Evacuating would involve moving more than 1.1 million people from the north to the south of the besieged enclave, amid constant airstrikes - a task that the United Nations says is dangerous and unfeasible. Israeli war planes have been pounding Gaza for a week, leveling entire neighborhoods, including schools and mosques. Israel says it strikes Hamas targets and that the group has used civilians as human shields. Israel's assault has killed at least 2,670 people in Gaza, and injured more than 9,600 others. Nearly 1 million Palestinians in Gaza have been forced from their homes, the UN has said. Here's what we know so far. What happened? Militants from Gaza fired thousands of rockets towards Israeli towns on October 7, before breaking through the heavily fortified border fence with Israel and sending militants deep into Israeli territory. There, Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 The attacks were unprecedented in tactics and scale as Israel has not faced its adversaries in street battles on its own territory since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. It has also never faced a terror attack of this magnitude that has taken the lives of so many civilians. While Hamas has kidnapped Israelis before, it has never before taken dozens of hostages at once, including children and the elderly. A senior Hamas official in Lebanon told a Russian state-backed channel that the group had been preparing for the attack for two years. Hamas called the operation ""Al-Aqsa Storm"" and said that it was a response to what it described as Israeli attacks on women, the desecration of the They said the bodies of some 1,500 Hamas fighters had been recovered inside Israel since Saturday's assault. How has Israel responded? In response to the attack, Israel has declared war and launched ""Operation Swords of Iron,"" striking what it says are Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza. It has also blocked supply lines of basic necessities to the Gaza population, including fuel and water. Between October 7 and 12, Israel dropped 6,000 bombs on the densely inhabited territory - that's equivalent to the total number of airstrikes on Gaza during the entire 2014 Gaza-Israel conflict, which lasted 50 days. Children make up ""between 30% and 40% of the wounded"" in Israel's airstrikes on Gaza, British-Palestinian surgeon Ghassan Abu-Sittah told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. The IDF has told civilians in Gaza to leave their residential areas immediately for their safety, but some say there is nowhere safe to go. All crossings out of Gaza have been shut. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said on Monday that he had ordered a ""complete siege"" on Gaza, blocking delivery of electricity, food, fuel and water. Energy Minister Israel Katz has said supplies will remain cut off until hostages being held by Hamas are freed. Israel on Wednesday formed an emergency government and war management cabinet. On Friday, Israel's military told the 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to evacuate their homes immediately. CNN has geolocated and authenticated five videos from the scene of a large explosion The videos show many dead bodies amid a scene of extensive destruction. Some of those bodies are on a flat-bed trailer that appears to have been used to carry people away from Gaza City. They include several children. There are also a number of badly burned and damaged cars. It's unclear what caused the widespread devastation; the explosion occurred on Salah al-Deen Street on Friday afternoon. IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN in an interview on Sunday that the Israeli military did not strike the convoy on Salah Al-Deen street. What's the situation in Gaza now? A humanitarian crisis in Gaza is rapidly spiraling amid warnings that peosple are at risk of starvation as Israel tightens its chokehold on the territory. The Gaza Strip is one of most densely populated places on earth, with some 2 million people crammed in 140-square-mile territory. The enclave lies on Egypt's western border and has been under blockade since Hamas seized control in 2007. The Israeli air, naval and land blockade on the territory, as well as the Egyptian land blockade, continue today. The enclave's only power station stopped working on Wednesday. Hospitals are expected to run out of fuel, leading to ""catastrophic"" conditions, the Palestinian Health Ministry warned. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that hospitals are at ""breaking point."" On Thursday, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned hospitals in Gaza ""risk turning into morgues"" as they lose power. Airstrikes have hit at least 88 education facilities and killed 12 UN personnel, according to the UN. The Palestine Red Crescent has warned of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" as there are ""no safe areas"" to evacuate civilians to, after Israel told half the population to migrate south. It described the Israeli evacuation call as ""shocking and beyond belief."" Human rights groups have meanwhile warned of possible war crimes being committed by Israel in Gaza. Amnesty International on Friday urged Israel to ""immediately"" lift its blockade on the enclave, saying the ""collective punishment"" of civilians for Hamas' terrorist atrocities amounts to a war crime. Since Israel shut its two crossings with Gaza, the only corridor through which Palestinians or aid can pass in and out of the territory is the Rafah Crossing, which connects the south of the enclave to Egypt. But it's unclear whether that crossing is open. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Saturday that the crossing is open but aerial bombardment has rendered the roads on the Gaza side ""inoperable."" Aid flights from Jordan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the World Health Organization, and the Red Cross have arrived in Egypt, but the supplies have not yet made it through the crossing. Shoukry said Egypt has tried to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza but has not received the proper authorization to do so. Hamas said on Friday that 13 Israeli hostages held in Gaza have been killed by ""random"" Israeli bombings on the enclave over the past 24 hours. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it could not confirm or deny the claim. Hamas also called on Gazans not to leave their homes, accusing Israel of engaging in ""psychological warfare"" by sending messages telling Palestinian civilians and employees of international organizations to evacuate to the south. ""Displacement and exile are not for us,"" Hamas said. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on Friday said it had relocated its central operations center and international staff in Gaza to the south of the besieged enclave. What is Hamas? Hamas is an The group, like most Palestinian factions and political parties, insists that Israel is an occupying power and that it is trying to liberate the Palestinian territories. It considers Israel an illegitimate state and has called for its downfall. Unlike some other Palestinian factions, Hamas refuses to engage with Israel. In 1993, it opposed the Oslo Accords, a peace pact between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that saw the PLO give up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The Accords also established the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas presents itself as a It has over the years claimed many attacks on Israel and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Israel. Israel accuses its archenemy Iran of backing the group. Hamas rules Gaza, the small strip of land bordering Israel and Egypt that has changed hands several times over the past 70 years. The vast majority of its population are How did the two sides get here? Tensions between Violence has been particularly acute this year. The number of Palestinians - militants and civilians - killed in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces since the year began is the highest in nearly two decades. The same is true of Israelis and foreigners - most of them civilians - killed in Palestinian attacks. Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas' control in 2007 after a brief civil war with Fatah, a rival Palestinian faction that is the backbone of the Palestinian Authority. After Hamas seized control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. Human Rights Watch has called the territory an ""open-air prison."" More than half of its population lives in poverty and is Hamas and Israel have fought several wars. Before Saturday's operation, the last war between the two was in 2021, which lasted for 11 days and killed at least 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel. Saturday's assault occurred 50 years almost to the day since the 1973 war, when Israel's Arab neighbors launched a surprise attack on Israel on What happens next? Israel is now on a war footing and has amassed more than 300,000 reservists along the Gaza border for a potential ground operation. It has said that it will exact a heavy price on Hamas for its attack and plans to retrieve Israeli hostages from the territory. Israel has dealt with hostage situations before, but never at this scale. In the past, militants have mostly demanded the release of prisoners held in Israeli jails in exchange for captured Israelis. In 2011, Israel traded 1,027 Palestinians for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and in 2004, it released more than two dozen Lebanese and Arab prisoners - including two senior Hezbollah officials - for Elhanan Tannenbaum, an Israeli businessman and army reserve colonel, as well as the bodies of three IDF soldiers. In 2008, Israel released five Palestinian prisoners, five Lebanese prisoners and returned the bodies of nearly 200 Arab fighters in exchange for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers. Hamas has captured at least 150 hostages. Their presence in Gaza will undoubtedly complicate any Israeli military operation there. The militant group's armed wing said Monday it would begin killing civilian hostages and broadcasting the act if Israel targets people in Gaza without warning. It isn't clear if it has acted on those threats yet. The IDF has said that it plans to take control of the Gaza Strip. Its spokesperson, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said the aim is to ""end the Gaza enclave"" and ""control the entire enclave."" When asked whether it had stopped the ""knock on the roof,"" which is the Israeli military's warning for civilians before it bombs a building. Hecht responded that Hamas did not ""knock on the roof."" ""When they came in and threw grenades at our ambulances they did not knock on the roof. This is war. The scale is different,"" Hecht said. Senior Hamas member Saleh al-Arouri told Al Jazeera Arabic on Saturday that Hamas is ready ""for all options, including a war and an escalation on all levels."" ""We are ready for the worst-case scenario, including a ground invasion, which will be the best for us to decide the ending of this battle,"" al-Arouri said. Could this lead to a wider regional conflict? Hamas' operation was carried out in a sophisticated and coordinated manner and would have taken a significant amount of planning. Speculation has been rife that the group may have received assistance from abroad, which, if proven, could raise the specter of a wider regional war. Israel says Iran supports Hamas to the tune of some $100 million dollars a year. The US State Department in 2021 said that the group receives funding, weapons, and training from Iran, as well as some funds that are raised in Gulf Arab countries. ""Of course Iran is in the picture,"" one US official told CNN. ""They've provided support for years to Hamas and Hezbollah.""A senior Biden administration official said on Saturday that it was too early to say whether Iran was directly involved in the attack, but that Washington will be tracking the matter ""very closely."" But President Joe Biden on Wednesday issued a stark warning to Iran to ""be careful"" around its actions in the region. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi spoke to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh by phone last Sunday and later congratulated the Palestinian people for their ""victory"" over Israel. On Monday, however, Iran's mission to the United Nations said the Islamic Republic was ""not involved in Palestine's response,"" referring to the Hamas attack. ""It is taken solely by Palestine itself,"" it said. On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said in Beirut that ""Lebanon's security is Iran's security,"" in an apparent warning to Israel not to strike Lebanon or the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group that operates there. He said that Western officials had asked him if new fronts could open against Israel, adding that it's ""probable"" that members of the ""resistance"" against Israel could enter the war ""with the continuation of Israeli war crimes."" The warning came a day after the Iran-allied Syrian regime said that Israel struck Damascus and Aleppo airports, rendering them non-operational. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has meanwhile been shuttling around the region, visiting Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jordan. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also arrived in Israel on Friday. The US has ordered t Israel may also face the threat of new fronts opening in the war. Of its immediate neighbors, it is only at peace with Jordan and Egypt, and is officially in a state of war with Lebanon and Syria. Israel has said it is ready in case there are attacks from those two countries. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has praised Hamas' attack and said it is in contact with Palestinian militant groups ""at home and abroad,"" its Al Manar channel said. The group claimed responsibility for targeting three Israeli sites in an area known as Shebaa Farms using missiles and artillery. The area is considered by Lebanon as Israeli-occupied. Israel responded by firing artillery. On Monday, the IDF said it killed a ""number of armed suspects"" who infiltrated into Israel from Lebanon and that soldiers were searching the area. Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati said on Monday that his country doesn't want to be drawn into the conflict. The IDF said Wednesday a report was received regarding a suspected ""infiltration from Lebanon into Israeli air space."" It did not provide further details and it was unclear whether the infiltration involved aircraft, drones, gliders, balloons or people.",Israel is at war with Hamas. Here's what to know

""What we're seeing in 2022 is good snow, generally, in some places - but at the same time, not consistent,"" Touton told CNN. ""You're seeing record events, followed by record dry months. Now add to that low reservoir level, because we didn't get a lot of inflow into our reservoirs last year."" The bigger picture is stark. The West's megadrought is the region's Western water experts echoed the concern that the term ""drought"" may be insufficient to capture the region's current hydrology. ""Aridification"" ""Are these temporary conditions? We don't know; the science is suggesting they're not,"" Kuhn said. ""It puts Reclamation in a tough situation, because they're learning how to deal with a changing climate. Operating these systems under deep uncertainty is not what they were designed for."" Competing for water The Bureau of Reclamation, situated in the Department of Interior, has a big role to play in how the West manages its declining water resources. Established in the early 1900s, Reclamation built some of the West's largest reservoirs and dams. It works with states, Native American tribes, farmers and other stakeholders to manage water, generate electricity from hydroelectric dams and prepare for drought. Touton is overseeing the bureau at a time when competition over the remaining water resources is intensifying. Last summer, the federal government declared a But a megadrought of this proportion had already been planned for on the Colorado River - a complex, negotiated priority system that favors some water shareholders ahead of others based on need and historical dependence. ""We've never been in these conditions before,"" Touton said. ""But with the partnerships that we've had in the basin for decades, there was always a concern that it could get there. And it was planned for and, unfortunately, that's what we're seeing now."" The bureau is due to receive $1.66 billion per year for the next five years from the Touton said that as Reclamation repairs some aging reservoirs and water facilities, it will also look at new water sources - including capturing stormwater when it rains and treating it to use later. John Fleck, a Western water expert and professor at University of New Mexico, said that for Reclamation, the challenge of repairing aging water infrastructure pales in comparison with drought contingency planning with states, tribes and farmers. The Colorado River basin ""has a fundamental problem with overallocation of the water,"" Fleck told CNN. ""These rules that were written down on pieces of paper over 100 years ago promised more water to users in states than the river can actually provide."" 'A moment of opportunity' Even in years with decent snowpack, the climate-fueled megadrought has meant the parched ground soaks up what moisture there is faster. That means intense competition for lower levels of water used for drinking, agriculture and electricity generation. As CNN has reported, the first group of people impacted by Colorado River water cuts will be farmers in Arizona - but municipalities in the state could also see reductions depending on far the river levels fall. ""The vast majority of this water is used for irrigated agriculture across the basin; there's just no way around the footprint of irrigated agriculture shrinking,"" Fleck told CNN. Kuhn said that in-home water use ultimately doesn't account for much of the overall usage, as many cities re-treat and recycle water from appliances. Los Angeles, for example, is working on a plan to The bigger problem is how to sustain agriculture and lawns. ""The future of the river is going to be about grass, it's not going to be about indoor plumbing,"" said Kuhn. ""The action is outdoors. It's crops and grasses."" Last summer, Nevada banned nonfunctional grass that uses up too much water, and some cities are looking at planting native plants and grasses that don't need constant watering. Fleck said that even though the drought is anxiety-inducing, it also creates opportunities for the federal government, states and stakeholders to have a realistic conversation about how to save water. ""When the reservoirs are full, people blow it off,"" Fleck said. ""When they are draining, that's when these opportunities arise. This creates a moment of opportunity; there are hard decisions to be made.""",Exclusive: Experts say the term 'drought' may be insufficient to capture what is happening in the West

Nearly a week after Israel first began moving tanks, bulldozers, infantrymen and combat engineer units into Gaza, Israel Defense Force spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Thursday that Gaza City has been surrounded. The IDF's engineering corps is working to locate and neutralize underground infrastructure, explosives and other threats so that troops can move freely, he said. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency meanwhile highlighted the civilian toll of the ongoing conflict, after agency chief Philippe Lazzarini announced that Israeli warplanes had hit several UN-run schools that had been sheltering civilians. More than 20 people were reportedly killed in the attacks, he said. ""Over the last few hours, I received reports that three of our schools sheltering about 20,000 people have been hit. This reportedly has led to the deaths of more than 20 people in Jabalya, and also one person at the beach camp,"" he said. An UNRWA statement later said a fourth school-turned-shelter had been hit. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Force (IDF) for comment. Chaos of the aftermath could be seen in a five-minute video posted to Telegram, which showed bloodied bodies strewn across the floor and people screaming at the UNRWA-sponsored Jabalya Elementary school. The agency's fuel stocks - crucial for moving aid and powering medical services - are also ""completely completed"" after weeks of an Israeli blockade on essential supplies entering Gaza, Lazzarini also said. UN independent experts have previously warned that the import blockade, which prevents fuel, water and food from entering in sufficient quantities, likely violates international law.

Three hundred and forty one foreign nationals left the enclave on Thursday, an Egyptian border official told CNN, following in the steps of the injured Palestinians and foreign nationals who were allowed to cross into Egypt on Wednesday - the first sanctioned exodus since Israel's siege and blockade began. In total, Egypt is preparing to facilitate the evacuation of nearly 7,000 foreign citizens in Gaza from more than 60 countries via the Rafah Crossing, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, has proposed an immediate ceasefire including the exchange of prisoners and ""opening of the political path to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state."" In a recorded video statement on Wednesday, Haniyeh said he had presented a ""comprehensive vision"" to end the war with Israel, but claimed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was ""deceiving"" his people by convincing them they could defeat Hamas in Gaza. 'Must be investigated as war crimes' Israel's weeks long bombardment of Gaza has killed at least 9,025 people and injured over 22,000, according to the latest figures released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawn from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. The civilian casualties have continued to rise as Israel strikes large residential areas, schools and hospitals in Gaza, in what it says are military target strikes. Amnesty International The devastation wrought by the strikes, which are part of Israel's Jordan on Wednesday became the latest country to recall its ambassador to Israel, following Chile and Colombia, due to the strikes on Gaza.

Israeli fighter jets on Thursday hit the vicinity of the Al Quds hospital in Gaza City where doctors say up to 14,000 displaced people are sheltering, according to the director of the hospital. The strikes that began Wednesday evening continued into Thursday morning and were ""getting closer to the hospital,"" Dr Bashar Mourad told CNN by phone. A strike on Wednesday strike in Jabalya killed at least 80 people and injured hundreds more, according to Dr. Atef Al Kahlout, the director of Gaza's Indonesian hospital. He told CNN more bodies were being dug out of the rubble, and the majority of casualties were women and children. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Wednesday attack targeted a Hamas command and control complex and ""eliminated"" Hamas terrorists ""based on precise intelligence."" ""Hamas deliberately builds its terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians,"" the IDF added in a statement. An earlier strike in the same camp also caused catastrophic damage, with survivors and eyewitnesses describing of apocalyptic scenes and family members buried under rubble. ""It felt like the end of the world,"" one eyewitness said. ""Children were carrying other injured children and running, with grey dust filling the air. Bodies were hanging on the rubble, many of them unrecognizable. Some were bleeding and others were burnt,"" Mohammad Al Aswad told CNN by phone. The IDF said the first strike killed several Hamas members, including Ibrahim Biari, whom it described as one of the Hamas commanders responsible for the October 7 attack on The United Nations Human Rights Office said on social media that the attacks on Jabalya, which is Gaza's largest refugee camp, ""could amount to war crimes"" given ""the high number of civilian casualties and the scale of destruction."" Nearly half of all hospitals in Gaza are out of service due to bombardments and fuel shortages, including the leading cancer hospital in the strip, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah. It warned Gaza's largest hospital Al Shifa would be forced to stop operating in less than a day. Meanwhile, the main generator for the Gaza Indonesian Hospital - one of the few remaining hospitals serving the northern part of the coastal enclave - went out of service Wednesday night, Dr. Atef Al Kahlout, the head of the hospital, told CNN Thursday, deepening fears for patients in intensive care. The hospital is considered a backbone in providing health services in northern Gaza and the outage has affected ventilation systems in the operating rooms, the hospital's only oxygen station, and the hospital morgue refrigerators, Al Kahlout said. Heading into Gaza through the Rafah crossing on Wednesday were 55 humanitarian aid trucks from the Egyptian Red Crescent containing food, water, medicines and medical supplies. A total of 272 aid trucks have crossed into Gaza so far - a drop in the ocean of the assistance needed - but no fuel has been allowed to enter, it said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/16/middleeast/israel-palestinian-evacuation-orders-invs,"CNN When Palestinians in north Gaza heeded the warnings issued in the Israeli military's phone calls, text messages, and fliers advising them to head south, they thought they were fleeing to potential safety. The Israeli Defense Forces issued the guidance Friday, telling all civilians in north Gaza to evacuate to areas south of Wadi Gaza ""for your own safety and the safety of your families"" as the IDF continues ""to operate significantly in Gaza City and make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians."" However, some Palestinians who followed the evacuation warnings and fled their homes in search of safety suffered the very fate they were running from: Israeli airstrikes killed them outside of the evacuation zone. The killings underscore the reality that evacuation zones and warning alerts from the Israeli military haven't guaranteed safety for civilians in the densely populated Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have In the early hours on Friday,  Aaed Al-Ajrami and his nephew, Raji, received a phone call from an Israeli military official - warning him to get everyone he knows and head southwards immediately, the nephew told CNN. Despite following the instructions and successfully fleeing south of the evacuation zone, Aaed's family was killed by an Israeli airstrike the next day. An audio recording of the phone call obtained by CNN reveals the details of the brief conversation - which included the IDF's instructions to flee south of the evacuation zone and no guidance on how to get there. Raji said once they realized who was calling, they recorded the conversation so they could share it with other family members. ""All of you go to the South. You and all your family members. Gather all of your stuff with you and head there,"" the officer told them. Aaed wanted to know what road would be safe to take and what time they should leave. ""It doesn't matter which road,"" the officer replied. ""Do it as fast as you can. There is no time left."" Aaed heeded the warning. By sunrise on Friday, he headed south with his family and relatives to stay with friends in Deir Al Balah, a city roughly eight miles south of Wadi Gaza and outside the evacuation zone. The next day, an Israeli airstrike in the area destroyed parts of the building where Aaed's family sought refuge - killing him and 12 other members of his family, including seven children. His nephew Raji, 32, was staying in a different building nearby when he heard the explosion and feared the worst. He rushed to the scene after receiving a call telling him that his uncle's family members were amongst the victims. ""The destruction was massive,"" Raji said.  ""We started digging people out who were hit by the explosion, some of them were still alive ... the gunpowder smell was very strong, the dust was everywhere."" ""These people all thought that they were finally safe and that nothing would happen in the area,"" Raji said. ""You can follow the orders so that you aren't exposed to danger, but the danger will still reach you wherever you are."" In response to CNN's query about the airstrikes in Deir Al Balah and other areas outside of the evacuation zone, an IDF statement said it's ""operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities."" While an estimated 500,000 Palestinians have fled northern Gaza for the south since Friday, many others are unable to make the journey south of the evacuation zone and are stuck in northern Gaza. Yara Alhayek, 22, told CNN that her family living in the north had nowhere to seek refuge if they headed south. ""We couldn't leave because there is no safe place to go to ... it's really dangerous if we leave our house, it's really dangerous if we stay in our house, so we have no idea what to do.""

Hearkening back to the days when its cars were also known for performance and excitement, the auto maker announced the return of its two-seat sports car, the Toyota Supra, at the Detroit Auto Show Monday. The newest version of the Supra, developed in cooperation with Germany's BMW, was test driven by Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda on various racetracks around the wold, including Germany's challenging Nurburgring. Toyoda is a certified race car driver known for his love of speed and it has been part of his mission to return some excitement to the brand. ""I think it reflects on his personality that this thing exists at all,"" said John Pearley Huffman, a contributing editor for Car and Driver, who has been writing about the new Supra for the magazine's next issue. The Supra name originated as a designation for a special high-performance version of the sporty Celica, the Celica Supra, in the 1970s. Later it became a separate model under its own name, offering a higher level of performance. The fourth generation of the Supra, sold in the 1990s, is considered the most desirable today, with one selling recently for more than $120,000 on vintage and classic car site BringaTrailer.com. Besides its innate speed and handling, which rivaled more expensive European cars of the time, enthusiasts fell in love with the 90s Supra Jack Hollis, head of marketing for Toyota, feels that customers are going to take to the new Supra in the same way.

""But we've been through this a bit."" What he means by ""this"" is a roller coaster of sea ice extent over the past couple of decades, swinging wildly from ""There's a link between what's going on in Antarctica and the general warming trend around the rest of the world, but it's different from what we see in mountain glaciers and what we see in the Arctic,"" he added. Satellite data that stretches back to 1978 shows that the region was still producing record-high sea ice extent as recently as 2014 and 2015. Then it suddenly plunged in 2016 and has stayed lower-than-average since. ""That kind of drop is pretty much unprecedented in the record,"" Marilyn Raphael, geography professor and director at UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, told CNN. ""Antarctic sea ice does vary from year to year, but that was a bigger variation than what normally happens."" Scientists say the recent shift doesn't yet necessarily signify a change in the long-term trend. But Raphael said the sea ice is retreating earlier now, which can be concerning. ""There are two parts of me that answer this - the scientist part says, 'wait a little bit longer and see.' That's my cautious part,"" Raphael said. ""Then the other part of me says, this is unusual variation in the ice. The degree is unusual, and it could be that that's a sign that climate is changing, and that's the speculation part."" The rate of sea ice loss in the Scambos said because continents are warming rapidly, snow cover is melting earlier than usual and exposing the dark surface of the ground, which absorbs more heat, causing the Arctic to melt faster. In contrast, the Antarctic stays covered in ice, which reflects sunlight and keeps the surrounding air cooler. Despite the complex climate signals in Antarctica's record low sea ice, scientists point out that the increasing warming trend in the polar regions amplifies the consequences of the crisis globally. ""Polar regions really have a way of making these small changes a bigger deal,"" Scambos said, ""either through sea-level rise, which is the main cause for concern from Antarctica, or through warmer climate generally, because the Arctic is sort of the air conditioner for the places where most of us live in the Northern Hemisphere."" He adds it would take more than a decade of a persistent downward trend in order to link the dwindling sea ice in the Antarctic to climate change, even though temperature conditions in many parts of Antarctica are already exhibiting a warming trend. But on the continent itself, some From their camp in the middle of the Antarctic to their stations on the coast, researchers flew over the Scambos said they could see ""massive cracks in this ice shelf, places where the ice is tearing apart."" He said it's an example of how the climate change impact in one very specific location could have consequences for the entire planet. ""The trends have rearranged a little bit because fundamentally over the last four decades, Antarctica has just been pushed around by the changes in ocean temperature and wind,"" said Scambos. ""The thing about Antarctica and sea ice is it is very unconstrained, sort of at the mercy of wind patterns, storms, snowfall, and ocean temperatures - all these things have an impact."" He said that the only rational way to tackle climate change is to rapidly adapt to the impacts and slash the planet-warming emissions that are the root cause of the crisis and have thrown our planet's most pristine places, such as the Antarctic, into a downward spiral. Recalling his time in West Antarctica, Scambos said he looked in the horizon with the cracking ice shelf holding back the Doomsday glacier in the background, and saw sobering signs of what's likely to happen in the future.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/china-nuclear-arsenal-military-power-report-pentagon/index.html,"CNN  In 2020, the US estimated that China had nuclear warheads numbering in the low-200s and expected the stockpile to double within a decade. Just two years later, China has reached that mark and could have some 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035 if they continue to expand their stockpile at the current pace, according to the 2022 China Military Power report released Tuesday. ""What we've seen really in the past couple of years is this accelerated expansion,"" said a senior defense official. The world's most populous country is using its burgeoning military as one of its tools to create an international system that favors its world view, posing the ""most consequential and systemic challenge to US national security,"" according to the report, and the larger nuclear capability is a far cry from what China used to call a ""lean and efficient"" nuclear deterrent. Beijing's investment in its nuclear triad - sea, land and air-based nuclear launch options - is cause for concern in Washington. ""We see, I think, a set of capabilities taking shape and new numbers in terms of what they're looking to pursue that raise some questions about what their intent will be in the longer term,"" the senior defense official said in a briefing to reporters about the latest report. China also conducted 135 ballistic missile tests in 2021, the report said, which is more than the rest of the world combined. (The tally excludes ballistic missiles used in the war in Ukraine, the report noted.) The official also offered new details about the Chinese test of a hypersonic missile in July 2021 that flew around the world before hitting its target, an accomplishment that drew attention to the lagging pace of US hypersonic weapons development. The official said the Chinese system flew 40,000 kilometers and demonstrated the longest flight of any Chinese land attack weapon to date. The Chinese military, formally known as the People's Liberation Army, is also developing space and counterspace weapons, the report said, viewing the advanced technology as a way to deter outside intervention in a regional military conflict. China has a standing army of nearly 1 million soldiers, the largest navy in the world by number of ships, and the third largest air force in the world, according to the report. The 2022 National Defense Strategy, released last month, identifies China as the pacing challenge for the United States, a point often reiterated by the Pentagon's top leaders. ""China is the one country out there that geopolitically has the power potential to be a significant challenge to the United States,"" said Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley at a news conference earlier this month. ""Based on their population, their technology, their economy and nano and a bunch of other things, China is the greatest geopolitical challenge to the United States."" Tensions between Beijing and Washington frequently revolve around Taiwan, a democratic, self-governing island. China sees the island as a fundamental part of its sovereign territory, including the South China Sea, and defense officials have previously said it intends to have the capability to use military force to take Taiwan by 2027. In the latest report - officially called the Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China - the US does not anticipate an imminent invasion of Taiwan. Instead, the report said, the US has seen Beijing ramp up diplomatic, economic, political and military pressure on Taiwan. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Since the visit, China has crossed the center line of the Taiwan Strait more frequently, the defense official said, a move they would only use infrequently in the past. In addition, there is more naval activity around Taiwan and a large number of Chinese aircraft flying into Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone. ""Even though we don't see an imminent invasion, that's sort of an elevated level of intimidating and coercive activity around Taiwan,"" the official said. Two weeks ago, President Joe Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping Biden also focused on the need for maintaining open lines of communication between Beijing and Washington. China cut off several contacts and meetings with the US following Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who met his Chinese counterpart in Cambodia last week, also emphasized the need for communication, according to a readout of the meeting. The report also looked at the relationship between Russia and China. The two countries issued a joint statement on February 4, signaling a desire for ongoing partnership and cooperation. Beijing and Moscow have ""complementary interests"" in terms of their national security and a shared approach to international relations. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine just weeks later has complicated the relationship in ways that may not be fully clear yet. ""Of course it's going to be an area of keen interest for us and other observers in Europe and elsewhere,"" the official said. ""We've seen the PRC kind of continue to support Russia diplomatically and to amplify a lot of their propaganda and disinformation. And so those are areas of particular concern.""","China could have 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035: Pentagon report"

Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. Even with Biden's new commitment, US allies contribute more to the effort. For instance, the European Union transfers around EUR25 billion a year (the equivalent of $29.3 billion). Biden's larger climate agenda, which includes billions of dollars to boost renewable energy and a new clean electricity program to decarbonize the US power sector, is currently making its way through Congress.

Kremlin officials said Russia had not been invited to the talks but was monitoring them, state media reported. While the summit yielded little more than a pledge to hold more discussions in the future, Ukraine hailed China's attendance as a diplomatic victory. Beijing had steered clear of a previous round of talks in Denmark in June, but has deepened ties with Saudi Arabia in recent years. China was given a prominent seat at the table in Jeddah. In photos published by Saudi Arabia's state news agency, Saudi national security adviser Musaed bin Mohammed Al-Aiba was sat between his US counterpart, Jake Sullivan, and Chinese Special Representative on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui. Li ""had extensive contact and communication with all parties on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis ... listened to all sides' opinions and proposals, and further consolidated international consensus,"" China's foreign ministry told Reuters in a written statement. ""All parties positively commented on Li Hui's attendance, and fully backed China's positive role in facilitating peace talks,"" the statement said, adding that Beijing would continue to work to strengthen dialog based on its 12-point proposal for Ukraine. CNN has reached out to the ministry for comment.

Beijing and Riyadh have been keen Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has coordinated oil output with Russia - both nations are members of the OPEC+ group of crude exporters - despite objections from the West and accusations that Riyadh was ""siding with Moscow"" in some of its oil cuts. In a statement from the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), Saudi Arabia stressed the importance of ""benefiting from views and positive suggestions"" made during the meeting. Russia mostly scoffed at the talks, describing them as ""Western efforts to mobilize the global south to support Zelensky's formula"" and saying such efforts were ""doomed to fail."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov however noted that the participation of BRICS countries such as China and India was potentially useful, as they may ""convey common sense to the Western patrons of Kyiv."" Russia would be discussing the outcome of the talks with its BRICS partners, Ryabkov added.

The project has divided politicians, analysts and Europeans for years, and has been beset by delays, previous German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's announcement was the strongest concrete response yet from the West to Russia's military action in eastern Ukraine. But it puts Europe in an uncomfortable position -- Russia could simply turn off its other gas taps that power most of the continent and leave millions of people in the dark and cold. Natural gas is the fuel that can power water heaters, furnaces, stoves and ovens. Germany already receives Russian gas through Nord Stream 1, a similar pipeline that also runs under the Baltic Sea. But as Russia stepped up its military action in Ukraine overnight, the pressure on Germany to stop the project in its tracks dialed up. Whether or not Germany officially scraps Nord Stream 2 in the long term, Russia's actions in Ukraine make the project politically dead. Fears that Russia would use Nord Stream 2 as a geopolitical weapon to push its interests -- and expansionism -- in Europe are now proving well-founded. But loading the weapon with actual gas will weaken Europe's position even further. The project was already running into political problems. Germany's new coalition government has a strong Greens presence that opposed the increased reliance on natural gas - a fossil fuel that is now contributing Nord Stream 2 was set to add Now Europe -- Germany in particular -- has an opportunity to use this moment to move away not just from Nord Stream 2 but its growing reliance on fossil gas altogether. Germany is one of few developed nations that opposes nuclear power and is in the process of shutting down its few reactors. Without it, it has become highly dependent on gas, and will need a radical rethink to speed up energy generation from renewables. Considering the environmental concerns around dealing with the radioactive waste that nuclear energy brings, its role in the future energy mix across Europe as a whole has its limitations. A rapid scale-up of renewables -- solar, wind and hydropower -- offer security in both energy and climate protection. Moving subsidies away from fossil fuels to renewables would be an easy first step. In the short term, Europe can scramble gas from other countries - unlikely enough to replace Russia, but perhaps enough to get by - and deal with the immediate Russian threat. But the forever problem of the climate crisis will keep churning and will ultimately be deadlier and costlier than military confrontation is likely to be.",The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is on the scrap heap because of the Ukraine crisis.

Deep cuts already in place The company rents cars under the brands Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly, a discount brand outside the United States. The company has already made deep cuts to stem its losses. It has notified 12,000 employees in North America that that they were losing their jobs, and another 4,000 are on furloughs. Its US workforce stood at 38,000 employees at the start of the year, with about a quarter of them represented by unions.

The lenders The company had a total of 568,000 vehicles and 12,400 corporate and franchise locations worldwide at the start of this year. About a third of those locations are at airports. A significant portion of Hertz's nonairport business is renting cars to people who are having their vehicles repaired after accidents. But with so many people out of work or working from home, the miles being driven and the number of car accidents are down significantly. Mounting losses and debt Hertz posted annual revenue of $9.8 billion last year, a company record, and its rental car revenue is comparable to that of rival Avis Budget Group Hertz had $18.8 billion of debt on its books as of March 31, up $1.7 billion from the end of last year. Most of that debt, $14.4 billion, is backed by its vehicles. That includes the debt for which it missed the payment in April the prompted this latest crisis. It had only $1 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of the end of March, A storied history Hertz was founded in Chicago just more than a century ago by Walter Jacobs, who sold the company in 1923 to John Hertz, who renamed it and expanded the fleet to 600 cars. He began the nation's first national rental network in 1925 and opened its first airport location at Chicago Midway Airport in 1932. Hertz has had a number of high-profile corporate owners, including RCA, United Airlines Its primary shareholder today is activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 38% of its shares outstanding. He continued to increase his stake in the company all the way through mid-March. Those shares, which increased the size of his stake by 26%, have lost more than 60% of their value in the two months since his most recent purchases. The problems at Hertz and the rental car business overall are particularly bad news for the world's automakers. Rental car companies are traditionally a major purchaser of new cars.

As of early March, it had sold 41,000 cars out of its US fleet and another 13,000 out of its European fleet.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/09/middleeast/hamas-attack-strategy-israel-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN The The multi-pronged attack saw as many as 1,000 assailants infiltrate Israeli territory, kill hundreds of soldiers and civilians, and take dozens of hostages back into Gaza. It was like Israel ""Things will change forever,"" said Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv. There is nothing in Israeli history that compares to this attack, he said. ""Hamas will no longer be Hamas that we knew years ago,"" Michael, who previously served as the deputy director general and head of the Palestinian desk at Israel's Ministry for Strategic Affairs, told CNN. Hamas said the attack was retribution for what it described as attacks on women, the desecration of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the ongoing siege of Gaza. Here's what we know about the group: What is Hamas? An The word ""Hamas"" is itself an acronym for ""Harakat Al-Muqawama Al-Islamiyya"" - Arabic for Islamic Resistance Movement. The group, like most Palestinian factions and political parties, insists that Israel is an occupying power and that it is trying to liberate the Palestinian territories. It considers Israel an illegitimate state. Unlike some other Palestinian factions, Hamas refuses to engage with Israel. In 1993, it opposed the Oslo Accords, a peace pact between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that saw the PLO give up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The Accords also established the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas presents itself as an The group has over the years claimed many attacks on Israel and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and Israel. The US State Department in 2021 said that Hamas receives funding, weapons, and training from Iran, as well as some funds that are raised in Gulf Arab countries. The group also receives donations from some Palestinians, other expatriates and its own charity organizations, it said. In April, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant suggested that Iran provides Hamas with some $100 million annually. What was Hamas' strategy in carrying out the attacks? By undertaking such a devastating strike, the group's primary goal would have been to dramatically shake up the status quo, experts say: Israel maintains a tight siege on Gaza and continues to occupy the West Bank, and the goal of an independent Palestinian state is nowhere in sight. One objective would be to put the Palestinian issue back on the regional and international agenda, said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and director of its Program on Palestine and Israeli-Palestinian Affairs. ""People had moved on (from the Palestinian issue),"" Elgindy told CNN. ""The new game in town is Saudi-Israel normalization, and this new regional integration."" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Elgindy said that, to some extent, Hamas has succeeded in its aim of bringing attention back to the Palestinian cause. The group may also be trying to shatter any conceptions about its military capabilities, analysts say. Hamas had delivered ""a blow to Israel beyond what it is used to,"" and was also putting its capabilities on display, said Omar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs who focuses on Palestinian affairs. Its shock tactics are a declaration that it ""must be taken more seriously,"" Rahman said. The Israeli military said Monday that Hamas had taken ""dozens"" of hostages and Hamas has said it has abducted The large number of hostages ensures that ""this is not a short-lived military tit-for-tat that will die down and be forgotten,"" Rahman said, ""but that it has longer-term political implications."" As part of its campaign against Israel, Hamas produced slick propaganda videos documenting its assault on Israel step-by-step. In some videos, its fighters wore bodycams to film the operations as they broke through Israeli fortifications and were seen dressed in commando-style uniforms. That's key to the group's propaganda war, analysts say, which serves a number of objectives. On the one hand, it is to ""instill fear"" among the Israeli public and imply that their leaders can't keep them safe, Elgindy said. ""That is going to come as a shock because Israelis take enormous pride in their military and their intelligence capabilities."" On the other hand, it is also for domestic Palestinian consumption. Hamas has been long caught in a political war with the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank and engages in security coordination with Israel. This is meant to show Palestinians that ""while over there, Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president) ... is basically asleep at the wheel, we are the true resistance, (and) are actually doing something,"" Elgindy told CNN of Hamas. Can Hamas survive Israel's response? Hamas' large-scale offensive shows that the group knows that the coming war may be an existential one, experts say. Michael, of the INSS, speculates that Hamas may have been trying to provoke an all-out war with Israel, and may have been promised regional backing by its allies should it take place. ""Hamas... has had a very clear strategy which is based on the organizing rationale of a multi-front conflict,"" Michael told CNN, adding that Hamas sees Gaza, Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Arab citizens of Israel who support Hamas, and southern Lebanon as potentially supporting its campaign. A senior Hamas official, Saleh al-Arouri, over the weekend said the militant group was ready for the ""worst-case scenario, including a ground invasion."" He said",What is Hamas and why is it attacking Israel now?
https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/15/us/us-sea-level-rise-report-noaa-climate/index.html,"CNN A new report provides an alarming forecast for the US: The interagency The implications of that forecast are enormous. ""This report is a wake-up call for the US, but it's a wake-up call with a silver lining,"" NOAA chief Rick Spinrad said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""It provides us with information needed to act now to best position ourselves for the future."" The projected sea level rise will lead to a significant increase in the frequency of coastal flooding even on sunny days, scientists report. Every inch of sea level rise also amplifies hurricane storm surge, coastal erosion and wetland loss - impacts which US coasts are already well familiar with. ""Decades ago, powerful storms were what typically caused coastal flooding,"" NOAA reports. Today, due to sea level rise, ""even common wind events and seasonal high tides regularly cause [high-tide flooding] within coastal communities, affecting homes and businesses, overloading stormwater and wastewater systems, infiltrating coastal groundwater aquifers with saltwater, and stressing coastal wetlands and estuarine ecosystems."" The report didn't set out to quantify how expensive these events would get in the future or how they would impact the economy. But Nicole LeBeof, the director of NOAA's National Ocean Service, noted that millions of people live along the coast, and the rest rely on products that enter the country through ports on the coast. ""What I will say is that the magnitude of these impacts, direct and cascading, will be high,"" LeBeof said at a news conference. ""Forty percent of the US population lives within 60 miles of our coastlines. There will be highly variable impacts along those coastlines, but there's no denying that a large portion of our economy and revenue and tax base are right there, front and center."" Catastrophic sea level rise Beyond 2050, the amount of sea level rise the US will experience is highly dependent on how much the world cuts fossil fuel emissions and limits global temperature rise. Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University and co-author on the report, said sea level rise is becoming ""increasingly sensitive to the amount of warming"" the planet is experiencing. For example, if global warming can be held to around 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, NOAA estimates sea level rise in the US could be limited to 2 feet by the end of the century. If temperatures are allowed to skyrocket, that forecast increases to 7 feet. Part of the reason that range is so large is the uncertainty over future changes in the world's largest ice sheets and how they will respond to rapid temperature rise. Faster melting of the Ben Hamlington, the sea level change team lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a co-author on the report, pointed to the ""We know where these different events could be triggered that would lead to rapid sea level rise, potentially,"" Hamlington told CNN. ""For right now, it's important that we build in that uncertainty into our scenarios, that possibility of that happening, and that's what we've done."" William Sweet, oceanographer at NOAA's National Ocean Service and the lead author on the report, said it's important that this report gives decision-makers a range of plausible outcomes beyond 2050. ""Considering the knowns and unknowns are very important for certain types of decision making,"" Sweet said. ""Those that are very risk averse, who really can't stand to be wrong, need to know these types of outcomes."" Storm surge and 'sunny day' flooding The report serves as an update to the federal government's The frequency of high-tide flooding has grown substantially in the past two decades, the report shows. ""We already are seeing once-rare tidal flooding events becoming increasingly frequent,"" Kopp said. ""So today along the Jersey Shore, flooding events that used to happen in the 1950s every year or two are now happening for several days a year on average."" Twenty years ago, New York City would experience these ""sunny day"" flood events around five days a year; that frequency has now shot to 10 to 15 days. In Miami, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, the frequency ballooned from two days in 2000 to five to 10 days in 2020. Researchers say these increases will continue to accelerate and spread to other coastal cities in the next few decades. And sea level rise has already made tropical cyclones and hurricanes A And as water piles up along the coast, rivers and streams that drain into the ocean can also be blocked, which forces water back upstream and extends the flooding farther inland. In 2021, Hurricane Ida's powerful storm surge All of these impacts worsen considerably with an additional foot of sea level rise through 2050. ""Today's disruptive, sunny day high tide flooding is a growing problem in many communities, but that will become damaging flooding in 30 years time due to this increase of a foot or more in many East and Gulf Coast communities,"" Sweet said. ""So what is now disruptive will become outright damaging to our infrastructure and to our commerce unless action is taken."" Limiting the worst Even if the world can slash fossil fuel emissions in the coming decades and put a cap on global warming, the report emphasizes that the sea level rise projections are essentially locked in through 2050. Oceans will continue to climb due to the warming that humans have already caused. And because tens of millions of people in the US already live in coastal areas at risk of flooding -- with more people migrating to the coasts each year, partly due to ongoing land development -- researchers say there will be a drastic rise in human exposure as well as the country's critical infrastructure. ""We need to collectively as a country understand that there's only so much sea level rise that can occur until real problems start surfacing in our communities,"" Sweet said. ""We need to recognize that it's largely an elevation issue at this point when storm surge flooding becomes replaced by tidal flooding."" But we can limit the worst long-term outcomes by reducing fossil fuel emissions, researchers say. The high-end forecasts for 2100 can be avoided if fossil fuel emissions are slashed. ""The next 30 years are pretty well in our headlights right now,"" Sweet said. ""We can give actionable information, but beyond that, emissions matter."" ""It's collectively in our hands to determine what our future scenario will actually be."" ","US sea levels will rise rapidly in the next 30 years, new report shows"

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/10/politics/us-intelligence-search-evidence-iran-direct-role-hamas-attack-israel/index.html,"CNN The US intelligence community is digging through its stores of data and tasking the nation's spy agencies to hunt for fresh clues to determine whether Iran played a direct role in Even as the US believes Iran is ""complicit"" in the attack, given its ""We're looking to acquire further intelligence,"" Sullivan told reporters at the White House. ""But as I stand here today, while Iran plays this broad role - sustained, deep and dark role in providing all of this support and capabilities to Hamas - in terms of this particular gruesome attack on October 7, we don't currently have that information."" Privately, multiple intelligence, military and congressional officials with access to classified intelligence tell CNN the same thing that Sullivan said publicly: No direct evidence has been found indicating Iran was directly involved. ""Waiting to see if we get a smoking gun in the intel,"" said one military official. Israeli intelligence is also going back and examining previous evidence, a senior Israeli official told CNN. ""I doubt that Iran had no knowledge whatsoever,"" the official said. ""We've seen meetings and we've seen the close coordination between them."" US and Israeli intelligence had no advance warning of the attack - something US officials say is stunning given the scale of the assault - and now, the Biden administration is treading cautiously. 'Where else would it have come from?' Iran has for years been Hamas' chief benefactor, providing it with tens of millions of dollars, weapons and components smuggled into Gaza, as well as broad technical and ideological support. Hamas maintains a degree of independence from the Iranian regime. Tehran doesn't have advisers on the ground in blockaded Gaza, according to former security officials and other regional analysts, and it doesn't command the group's activities. But the unprecedented scale of the weekend's attack - combined with analysts' broad belief that Iran sees the attack as a net positive for its interests in the region - have fueled questions of whether Hamas could have pulled off such a sophisticated operation without direct Iranian assistance. ""We spend a lot of time and resources worrying about what Iran is doing and how to counter what Iran is doing,"" a State Department official said. ""This certainly opens up a new chapter in that discussion."" In 2022, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said publicly that the group had received about $70 million from Iran that year and that it used the money to build rockets. A State Department report from 2020 found that Iran provided about $100 million annually to Palestinian terrorist groups, including Hamas. Former US officials say there is little question the massive stockpile of weapons used in Saturday's attack was acquired and assembled with help from Iran. ""Hamas didn't build the guidance system and those missiles in Gaza,"" said retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the former commander of US Central Command. ""They got them from somewhere. And the technology assistance to put it together certainly came from Iran - where else would it have come from?"" Still, the Biden administration has for days stopped short of attributing a role in the tactical planning and execution of the attack to Tehran, and current and former US intelligence analysts who spoke to CNN cautioned that past Iranian support to the group isn't enough evidence to prove its direct involvement. ""Even if they didn't give the instruction, you see it in the support,"" said Zohar Palti, the former head of the Political-Military Bureau at Israel's Ministry of Defense. ""Is Hamas a complete Iranian proxy that does everything Iran wants? No. But the relationship is much closer than it was even three years ago."" Tehran has denied any involvement in the attack, even as it has lauded it publicly. Israel has also expressed caution publicly. ""We have no evidence or proof"" that Iran was behind the attack, Maj. Nir Dinar, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, told Politico on Monday. ""We are 100 percent sure that the Iranians were not surprised."" Disrupting Saudi, Israeli negotiations Privately, some US officials believe it's likely Iran had at least some involvement in the planning of the attack. But those personal assessments are largely based on the belief that Iran would likely look for any opportunity to disrupt the Other analysts say it's equally likely that Iran would have wanted to maintain its distance from any Hamas operation against Israel -- even if it was aware of the attack in advance. It is not in Iran's interest to have more direct involvement, said Norm Roule, the former national intelligence manager for Iran at the CIA. ""Iran identifies regional proxies and then provides them with the political, financial and security support to dominate their particular geography,"" Roule said. ""Iran encourages military operations, but its proxies manage those actions."" It's possible that Iran provided some operational and planning support in advance of the attack, but that it told Hamas, ""You're on your own once it happens,"" said Mike Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute who specializes in Iran-backed proxy groups. ""This looks like Hamas learned some very significant new tricks from someone else and that may well have been the Iranians,"" Knights said. ""But that doesn't necessarily mean that Iran is up for broadening the war."" An evolving relationship The relationship between Iran and Hamas has evolved over the years. In the early days of the Syrian civil war a decade ago, Hamas and Iran found themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. For years, the two had a fraught relationship driven by two different Islamist ideologies: Sunni Muslim Hamas and Shia Muslim Iran. But Hamas saw Iran's influence expanding in the region, especially as America's shrinking role in the Middle East created a power vacuum for Tehran to exploit, according to Michael Milshtein, the former head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs in the Israeli military's intelligence directorate. More recently, Tehran has stepped up the training assistance it provides Hamas inside Iran, according to a former Western defense official. ""Iran was being more proactive in logistics and training of these people,"" the former official said. ""They've gone full on in last few years ... with explicit desire to destabilize"" the region. According to Knights, the closest relationship that Shia Iran now has with any Sunni group is Hamas. Tehran has ""provided Hamas with precision loitering munitions drone systems that it has not even provided the Iraqi militias, (with) which it has had relationships since the 1980s."" ""This suggests a level of actual operational arming, training, equipping that we've only previously seen with Lebanese Hezbollah, and then with the Houthis in Yemen,"" Knights said. But Hamas is not a proxy of Iran, Milshtein said. Unlike terror groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas maintains a large degree of independence from Tehran, even as the assistance has dramatically expanded. ""Hamas became comfortable getting close to Iran,"" Milshtein said, but the relationship remains largely based on military cooperation. Hamas received Iranian weapons and military technology, and learned from the Iranians about planning operations. But the power to make a decision remained with Hamas' leadership. ""Everything we have seen in the last four days, we can't say it's an Iranian plan or an Iranian effort,"" Milshtein said. ""It's a Hamas plan that got Iranian help."" Searching for a motivation US intelligence officials are also working to understand Hamas' immediate motivation for launching the attack. Unlike the Palestinian Authority, the militant group does not recognize Israel and is committed to the destruction of the Jewish state. Broadly, the more than 2 million residents of the Gaza Strip live in crowded and substandard conditions, partly as a result of a yearslong Israeli blockade and recurring airstrikes on the densely populated enclave. McKenzie and others said Hamas was likely motivated by its own parochial cause more than it was by any interest in disrupting normalization talks. ""I think the Hamas calculation is very little on normalization,"" McKenzie said. ""I think it's less the larger geostrategic things in the theater. ""It's the Hamas-Israeli relationship, not the larger, 'What does this mean to Saudi Arabia?'""",US intel agencies hunt for evidence of Iranian role in Hamas attack on Israel
https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/14/us/west-megadrought-climate-wastewater-recycling/index.html,"CNN The West is in its worst drought in centuries, scientists reported Monday. A study published in The Burning fossil fuels is having a direct impact on water availability in the West, which for the past two decades has been characterized by dry weather, with You don't have to look further than Los Angeles in December for an example. With nearly 10 inches of rain, it was the second-wettest such month on record for the city, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But the dreams of drought remediation were dashed when it became clear the jet stream did not have more lined up in the new year. Last month, less than a tenth of an inch of rain fell in Los Angeles, making it the eighth-driest January on record for the city. Halfway through February, things are only getting worse. This year is off to a record-dry start. Fluctuations like these are becoming ""There's good documentation that, in fact, there is less rainfall. What seems to be happening according to most of the climate scientists is we're getting longer, drier periods,"" said David Feldman, professor of urban planning and public policy at University of California at Irvine, and director of Park Williams, a climate scientist at UCLA and the study's lead author, said it will take several years of above-average rain and snowfall to cut through the megadrought. ""It's extremely unlikely that this drought can be ended in one wet year,"" he said. A rainy day saved for later Officials in Los Angeles are acutely aware of the water fluctuations and are working to capture every drop possible. Los Angeles County has dug several large, open dirt basins - known as spreading grounds - to absorb rainfall and recharge underground aquifers. The basins also take in water diverted from dams. ""When we know that we're going to get significant storms in the LA area, we obviously work really closely with LA County flood control,"" said Anselmo Collins, senior assistant general manager of the water system for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. ""If they happen to have a lot of water stored in their flood control dams, they can release that water ahead of time; give it an opportunity to percolate and make room in those dams and the reservoirs to be able to collect the water that's coming in at the same time."" The water's slow journey of filtering down through the soil into the aquifers also cleans the water, Collins explained. ""When we pump it later on, we treat it again, and then it goes into our water distribution system, and it will get treated again,"" said Collins, noting LADWP's rigorous water treatment program. ""When you talk about water, it's something very personal to people ... it's something you put into your body."" Ultimately, Los Angeles is working to become less dependent on imported water. Currently, as much as 90% of water used in Los Angeles is imported from Northern California, the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Colorado River Basin. The plan, which is in progress, calls for 70% of the city's water to be locally sourced by 2035. ""One of our major focuses is on recycled water and, in fact, this is a goal that the city of Los Angeles has, to recycle 100% of all wastewater,"" said Traci Minamide, chief operating officer of Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment. ""That will help us provide a local source of water that's sustainable and consistent."" And she does mean 100% of all wastewater. ""The recycled water is coming through the wastewater collection system, across our whole network of 6,500 miles of sewers. It's coming from all the residents and commercial businesses,"" Minamide said. ""It's all the stuff and then breaking it out and then cleaning it up after that."" Minamide explained the water is treated to a very high purity - better than distilled water, she said - before it is supplied for groundwater infiltration, which is later pumped up, treated and used for drinking water. LA Sanitation and Environment is already treating and supplying up to 12 million gallons a day to the aquifers, but Minamide said they are planning to boost the figure to more than 200 million gallons a day. ""Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant is one of the largest treatment plants in the country and that water right now is being treated and discharged. We're just losing it out to Santa Monica Bay,"" Minamide said. ""There's an opportunity for us to treat that water in a very advanced fashion under regulations, to a point where it can actually be used to help the water supply system."" Sanitation and Environment also has other dry weather diversion projects aimed at capturing runoff on the city's streets, cleaning up water and then offering it for irrigation locally. In other parts of town, the landscape is designed for the ground to absorb the water right where it is into aquifers and some renovations are required to factor in water conservation, for example, switching to permeable pavers instead of asphalt. A 'political and social' question As climate change continues to pound the region, leading to less rain and more excessively hot days, Los Angeles is using innovations to manage the city's water needs down the line. ""Whether we will in fact manage it is a political and a social question, not a technical one. The technologies are there,"" said Feldman. While some projects slated to store much more water are years away, experts say it might have been harder to get legislation passed if residents weren't on board. A couple of decades ago, voters might not have been willing to pay more in taxes to recycle water and capture rainfall when conserving water wasn't a hot topic. However, now it seems the will is there. Minamide pointed to data which shows more people are concerned about being wasteful. ""Despite the increase in the population over the past 20 years of roughly a million, we have seen our water use, and then our wastewater commensurately, actually go down,"" Minamide said. So people are saving water, but more could be done. ""I'd like to see for us to get smart on our end uses of water. Don't use as much water for outdoor landscaping,"" offered Feldman. ""Think about ways of replacing and more efficiently using our appliances."" In fact, the largest hurdle may be getting people to change how they think about water. ""Water isn't free,"" Feldman said. ""Somebody has to go and acquire the water, treat it, distribute it to our homes and then treat the wastewater after it leaves our homes. We need to think about water as a precious commodity.""","The West's megadrought is worst in 1,200 years. Los Angeles is taking wastewater recycling to the extreme"
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/10/middleeast/israel-incursion-gaza-analysis-wedeman-intl/index.html,"CNN ""Get down!"" the medic in the front seat hissed as our ambulance approached the Israeli checkpoint. I could see through the front window tanks by the side of the road, nervous Israeli soldiers raising their guns as we approached. This was January 2009 and the CNN crew had caught a ride with a convoy of ambulances going from Rafah in the southern This was what Israel had dubbed After a brief exchange with the medics in the lead ambulance, the soldiers waved us through without inspecting the ambulances. It was the deepest Israeli ground operation into Gaza since the withdrawal from the Strip in 2005. Then, Israeli troops largely avoided the most built up and crowded areas, particularly Gaza's eight crammed refugee camps.  They were well aware that entering into the narrow alleys of camps like al-Shati, one of the most crowded, would be risky. Their focus was on controlling the periphery of urban areas. Israel's tactics have always been to move fast, control as much territory as possible, but avoid street-to-street, house-to-house fighting where a weaker opponent can take full advantage of the terrain. Entering urban areas in Gaza, however, would bring in an entire new element to the fight. At the moment Israeli forces are engaged with In March 2008, I went to Gaza to cover an Israeli incursion into the north, this time dubbed ""Hot Winter,"" yet another attempt to stop rocket fire from Gaza. At the time, Hamas was in full control of the Gaza Strip, having expelled the rival Fatah faction the previous year. But when I arrived in the area where Israeli forces were trying to advance, it wasn't Hamas fighters but rather gunmen from the PFLP who were running street battles with Israeli troops. They ducked in and out of alleyways, sprinted across streets with rocket propelled grenade launchers and Kalashinkov assault rifles. The young men were almost giddy with excitement. They finally had a chance to fight Israeli troops on their own ground. Eventually, the Israelis pulled out. The rocket fire continued. Going back to the summer of 1982 when Israel invaded Lebanon in pursuit of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Israeli forces made it all the way to Beirut then stopped on the outskirts, establishing a siege much along the lines announced Monday by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. It was clear even back then that entering Beirut, particularly the Palestinian refugee camps, would be a deadly mission for all. During the siege that followed, Israeli warplanes and artillery pummeled West Beirut, but ground troops stayed out of Beirut proper. In the end, under American pressure, a deal was worked out whereby Palestinian fighters would evacuate Beirut and Lebanon to Yemen, Tunisia and elsewhere. It was only after they left that Israeli troops took control of the western part of the city. Soon afterwards in September 1982, with Israel in control of West Beirut, the Israeli military, under the leadership of then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, allowed their right-wing Christian Lebanese allies, the Kataib, to enter Sabra and Shatila refugee camp and slaughter over a thousand civilians who no longer were able to defend themselves because the men of fighting age and their weapons had left as part of the US-brokered deal with the PLO. The What awaits it is a Hamas that has shown, despite the cruelty vividly displayed in its Saturday attack, a level of military capability far beyond what was previously thought. It is probably well prepared for the next phase in this war. Over the past week, Israel has launched hundreds of punishing strikes on Gaza, turning some areas into wastelands of shattered concrete and twisted metal. In the process, over 2,200 Palestinians - including many civilians and over 700 children - have been killed. And this is just the initial phase of this war. If it comes, the ground operation will be far bloodier and more destructive. Israeli forces will also have to be mindful that spread around Gaza are more than a hundred captive Israelis - soldiers and civilians, including women and children - held hostage by Hamas. And although no one outside Hamas knows where they're being held, it's likely they're in the most difficult areas for Israeli forces to access, possibly in crowded refugee camps. As eager as Israel's leaders may be to deal a fatal blow to Hamas, it will come at a very high price. To all.",What would an Israeli ground assault in Gaza look like? Here's what I've seen before
https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/24/middleeast/saudi-iran-media-protests-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN A top Iranian military official issued a warning to Saudi Arabia last week as his government continued to face off against protesters at home. ""You are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable, it is better to be careful,"" he said at the sidelines of a military drill. Major General Hossein Salami, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was referring to what state news outlets called a "" Then, on Thursday Iran  Now in their sixth week, protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the As the protests rage, Iran is turning up the heat on its adversaries, mainly the United States and Riyadh hasn't publicly commented on the protests. The kingdom's foreign minister refused to give his view when asked to during an interview with Al Arabiya news channel on October 12. ""Saudi Arabia has a fixed policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of states,"" Iran and Saudi Arabia severed ties in 2016 and both parties have backed opposite sides in proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Last year, they began direct talks in an attempt to improve relations. Baghdad has hosted five rounds of talks so far, the last of which was held in April. At the heart of Iran's most recent accusations against Saudi Arabia may be Iran International, a Persian-language news channel that broadcasts from London. The channel has become one of the go-to sources for many Persian speakers looking for news on the protests. It has been at the forefront of covering the demonstrations, getting breaking news and exclusive footage of the events on the ground. Its Twitter account has over a million followers. Founded in 2017, Iran International has previously come under scrutiny by the Iranian government. Some say it is due to their coverage of the protests at home, which in recent weeks have rocked the Islamic Republic. Salami didn't name the channel in his warning, but government-backed Iranian media last week accused Saudi Arabia In 2018, Iran International released a statement denying connections to any government, including Saudi Arabia or Iran after The Saudi Arabia did not comment on the Guardian report. The Saudi government did not respond to CNN's request for comment. ""We have heard these accusations before most often promoted by those in whose interests it is to deny a free press,"" a spokesperson for Volant Media told CNN. ""Iran International and its sister channel, Afghanistan International, are editorially independent television channels owned by Volant Media, a company based in London owned by a Saudi Arabian/British citizen; it has no state backing or affiliation,"" added the spokesperson.   Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a media conglomerate with ties to the Saudi ruling family, has run the Persian language website of the UK's Independent newspaper since 2018. Its account on Instagram, where many Iranians get their news, has over 600,000 followers. CNN's parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which has a partnership with Saudi Research and Media Group, a Saudi joint stock company. Saudi Arabia has for years accused Iran of doing the same with its own Arabic-language news channels: targeting Arab audiences with propaganda. State-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting runs Al Alam TV, an Arabic news channel that has interviewed Saudi opposition figures and has been blocked by Arab states. Iran-backed Hezbollah's Al Manar channel has also been blocked. ""It's about time Iran gets a taste of its own medicine,"" said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst. ""Iran has spent decades inciting and funding instability in the Arab world so having them pay the price of such behavior themselves is certainly a source of satisfaction to a lot of people,"" he told CNN. The channel ""is making an impact on public behavior in Iran and they are nervous about their domestic situation,"" added Shihabi. Analysts say that Iran's tight grip on domestic media outlets and its lack of freedom of expression have created ""fertile ground"" for anti-establishment platforms such as Iran International to flourish. ""It is not so much the broadcasters themselves, but the situation in Iran has provided the possibility for broadcasters outside of Iran to gather a certain degree of popularity in the Iranian context,"" said Gholam Khiabany, a reader in media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London.  Iran International stood out from other Western-backed Persian language news outlets ""by taking the side of the disenchanted, oppressed, voiceless people,"" while competitor Persian channels in the West were focused on bringing balance by giving the Iranian government a voice, he told CNN. ""They have a vision, of course - they don't do it for God,"" said Najafizada, referring to the shareholders. ""That vision is democracy."" Just two days after Salami's first warning, however, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran's supreme leader, was quoted saying that the two countries should reopen their embassies to facilitate a rapprochement, according to the ""We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,"" he was cited as saying by ISNA. ""The embassies of the two countries should reopen in order to solve our problems in a better way.""  Business owners and factory workers in Iran's Kurdish region went on strike over the weekend as anti-government protests continued.

The Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw said shopkeepers were on strike in Bukan, Sanandaj and Saqez, as well as Marivan.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/14/world/antarctic-thwaites-glacier-climate-warming/index.html,"CNN As the rapidly heating planet alters the landscape of the Satellite images taken as recently as last month, which Antarctica's Thwaites glacier is known as the ""Doomsday glacier,"" due to the serious risk it poses during its melting process. It has dumped billions of tons of ice into the sea, and its demise could lead to irreversible changes throughout the planet. The glacier, which equals the size of Florida or Great Britain, already accounts for about 4% of annual global sea level rise, loses roughly 50 billion tons of ice each year, and is becoming highly vulnerable to the climate crisis. The fall of the ice shelf could bring the impending collapse of Antarctica's critical glacier. If the Thwaites collapsed, the event could raise sea levels by several feet, researchers say, putting coastal communities as well as low-lying island nations further at risk. But Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, and a leader of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, said it will still be decades before the world will see real acceleration and an additional uptick in sea level rise. ""What is attention-getting about Thwaites is that the change will proceed with fairly dramatic, measurable results within the next few decades,"" Scambos told CNN. For now, the glacier is being held back by a critical floating ice shelf. ""What's most concerning about the recent results is that it's pointing to a collapse of this ice shelf, this kind of safety band that holds the ice on the land,"" Peter Davis, oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN. ""If we lose this ice shelf, then the glacier will flow into the ocean more quickly, contributing towards sea level rise."" Warming ocean waters play a key role in driving the rapid deterioration. A The observations show the critical ice shelf keeping the Thwaites together is loosening its grip on the underwater mountain, or the seamount, which acts as a reinforcement against the ice river from flowing into the warm ocean. Researchers also found the so-called ""ice tongue"" of the Thwaites Glacier is simply now a ""loose cluster of icebergs,"" which no longer influences the stable part of the eastern ice shelf. Warm water also threatens the so-called ""grounding zone,"" where the ice meets the seabed. Davis and his team used hot water to drill access holes from the surface of the ice shelf and deep into the ocean cavity underneath. In doing so, they discovered not only are the ocean waters in the grounding line warm, by polar standards, but it is also salty, priming the landscape for further erosion. Peter Washam, a research associate at Cornell University, who is also involved with the research, said the physical features of the grounding zone shows signs of chaos, such as warm water, rugged ice, and a steep, sloping bottom that allows the water to rapidly melt the ice sheet from below. ""In the coming years, we expect the Thwaites grounding line in the region to slowly retreat up the seabed slope that it currently rests on as the warm ocean eats away at its underside,"" Washam told CNN. His team used an underwater vehicle called Icefin that makes it easier to study ice and water around and beneath ice shelves. The bottom line, according to Davis, is Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier is rapidly deteriorating. The warm ocean water is slowly erasing the ice underneath, causing water to flow faster, fracturing more of the ice, and bringing the looming threat of a collapse even closer. ""From the satellite data, we're seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,"" he said. ""It's slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it's going to fracture into lots of different pieces."" Scambos said while the process is extremely slow-moving and real impacts won't be felt until several decades later, it is nearly impossible to stop it. ""This is a geologic process, but happening at almost a human-lifetime scale,"" he said. ""As a disaster for people alive today, it is extremely slow-moving. The best path is to try to slow the forces that are pushing the ice in this direction."" And as the ramifications of the climate crisis spread around the globe, the researchers say expanding scientific research to understand changes in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions is critical to planning mitigation strategies such as coastal defenses in vulnerable communities. ""We can't really do anything to stop this from happening,"" besides slowing it down, Davis said. ""The way that we've gone with our carbon emissions so far has caused these changes to occur -- and essentially, we're taking the consequences of what we've been emitting over the last couple of decades, if not longer.""","The ice shelf holding back the 'Doomsday glacier' could shatter within the next five years, scientists warn"

The current price is  The Russia standoff could drive prices up further, but the hike in California also has a climate change element to it. Isidore notes there are changes on the West Coast in part due to a switch to renewable fuels. That change, necessary to transition away from fossil fuels, is pushing California prices faster than the country's as a whole. The nationwide average gas price is $3.51 a gallon. ""California is the proxy for what will happen with the energy transition,"" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, tells Isidore. ""A number of refineries have closed permanently. ... Getting people away from fossil fuels might be the right thing to do, but it is not without pain."" When I asked Isidore about gas prices in California, he pointed out that if Biden does want to meet his goal of half of auto sales in the US being electric vehicles, the White House should be thrilled by high gas prices. As gas prices were rising in California, 10% of its car sales were EVs through the first 11 months of 2021 - three times the national average, Isidore said.  Having failed so far  The federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon pays into a trust fund that finances US highways. The tax was first imposed in the 1930s and it has been set since 1993. It was not raised to pay for the bipartisan infrastructure bill to improve the nation's roads and bridges, which Congress passed last year.  Press secretary Jen Psaki did not mention it when she was asked what steps Biden could take to combat price increases due to the Ukraine situation. She noted Biden has already tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move experts said is mostly symbolic. The other tool Biden has is pressure on other countries. ""He has also engaged, we have engaged with oil-producing countries around the world,"" Psaki said. ""That's something we will continue to do because, clearly, we need to ensure that the supply out in the global market is meeting the demand.""   Even if a gas tax holiday would bring prices down, it would require 60 votes in the Senate - and that seems unlikely. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the Dr. No of the Democratic caucus, has already thrown cold water on the idea.

Mike Crapo of Idaho told reporters. That leaves Biden fearing further hikes, unable to control them and very likely to pay his own political price for the pain Americans feel at the pump.

California - facing back-to-back dry years and record-breaking heat waves that pushed the drought Climatologists were cautiously elated as they watched snow pile as high as some roofs. But they still were going to need much more to make headway on the drought, said Andrew Schwartz, the lead scientist and station manager at the University of California, Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Laboratory. ""We are really concerned about the upcoming months not having as many storms,"" Schwartz told CNN at the time. That's exactly what happened in January, which is expected to go down as the driest on record for many parts of the state. Climatologists are now worried about the severity of the drought in the months to come. On Thursday, 66% of California was in severe drought, the Precipitation ""flatlined"" last month, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Statewide snowpack, which had been at 160% of normal in December, is down to around 90% due to the lack of new accumulation and some midwinter melting, he said. Schwartz's snow lab - where the 17 feet of snow fell in December - got just 9 inches in January. Twenty out of the state's 30 major climate stations reported their top five driest Januarys on record. Last month is expected to be the driest January on record - since at least 1895 - across the central and southern Sierra Nevada, much of the San Joaquin Valley and parts of the Sacramento Valley and Central Coast, Swain said, based on preliminary data. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will release the final statistics in the coming days. ""It's extremely fortunate that October and December 2021 were very wet months in California, as otherwise this extremely dry January and start to February would have produced pretty dire consequences,"" Swain said. The Climate change has also increased the potential for dramatic swings in weather. In California, this has led to extended periods of extreme drought with short bursts of high precipitation. Scientists say the chances of sudden transitions, also known as weather whiplash, will become more common in the coming decades. ""A big part of what we're seeing is natural variability of the climate system, but anthropogenic climate change has enhanced those natural drought signals,"" Schwartz said. ""That is why we're seeing consecutive years of extreme drought mixed with higher precipitation amounts from the storms that do occur."" Warmer temperatures are also eating into the state's high-elevation snowpack, which serves as a natural reservoir that eases drought, storing water through the winter months and slowly releasing it through the spring melting season. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada accounts for 30% of California's fresh water supply in an average year, according to the California Department of Water Resources. The state's major man-made reservoirs, which are replenished by rainfall and spring snowmelt, are at levels around 75% of average for this week. Ideally, they would be above 100% to ensure there's enough water for the dry months to come, Schwartz said. ""We still need about 8 feet of snow here at the lab to hit our season average and then any additional snow will go towards relieving the drought,"" Schwartz said. ""At this point, we're looking at needing several above-average precipitation winter seasons to really pull us out of the drought."" Although the drought is not as severe right now as it was over the summer, it could ""potentially reintensify if rain and snow do not return in the coming weeks,"" Swain said. Still, the precipitation outlook for the rest of the winter and the coming spring is drier than average, Schwartz and Swain said. ""It's not looking like we'll see any relief from our dry weather pattern anytime soon,"" Schwartz said.",17 feet of snow sparked hope for quelling California's drought.

Li received a warm reception during his final stop in the Russian capital -- where he previously But across Europe, officials stressed a different point -- the need for a peace that sees Russia withdraw its invading troops and Ukraine's legal territory restored -- and their interest in seeing China throw its weight behind that vision, which it has yet to do. Instead Li, according to readouts from Beijing, called for building ""consensus"" toward peace talks and strengthening Europe's own ""security architecture"" -- a veiled reference to China's view that Europe should not protect itself through institutions like NATO, which include the United States but not Russia. ""The basic problem is that China does not want Russia or Putin to appear to have failed ... (and) a settlement that requires Russia to relinquish territories taken in the invasion would be a defeat for Russia,"" said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London. As such, that's ""not on the table for China,"" Tsang said. ""But Ukraine cannot accept anything that does not involve the restoration of its territories,"" and the EU is unwilling to see Russia ""appearing to get away with"" territorial gains from its invasion, he added. A ""just"" peace China -- which That stance has horrified much of Europe, and Li's tour comes as China has been attempting to repair relations there. A vaguely-worded 12-point position paper on It also said the ""sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity"" of all countries must be upheld. But crucially the paper did not call for the withdrawal of Russian troops to end hostilities, instead advocating a ceasefire -- a point Western critics have said is tantamount to allowing Russia to solidify its illegal territorial gains. Critiques of China's stance on how to end the conflict and its close relationship with Russia were implicit in summaries provided by European officials of their meetings with Li, where they urged Beijing to align more with their views. ""Any attempts to equalize the status of Russia -- the aggressor in this conflict, and Ukraine -- the victim, are not acceptable,"" Polish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Wojciech Gerwel told Li. ""Any meaningful way to end Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine must be consistent with the UN Charter in its entirety,"" EU Deputy Secretary-General for Political Affairs Enrique Mora said in his meeting with the Chinese envoy. Frederic Mondoloni, who heads Political and Security Affairs of France's Foreign Ministry, told Li Paris was convinced China could play a role in a ""just and lasting peace"" -- in particular on Ukraine's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" while emphasizing that Moscow held ""full responsibility for the unleashing and continuation of the war."" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, too, underlined Kyiv's own ""peace formula,"" which includes an unequivocal call for the withdrawal of Russian troops and the return of their internationally recognized borders when he met Li earlier this month. When asked about Li's tour on Friday, Mao Ning a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said China's efforts toward peace talks have ""received broad understanding and support in the international community.""  But while Beijing has insisted it remains neutral on the war, its close positioning with Russia and contentious relationship with the United States -- whom it has accused of fueling the conflict by supporting Ukraine's defense -- have also raised questions over the intentions behind its push for peace. Over the weekend, Kuleba addressed a report in the Wall Street Journal that cited Western officials saying Li pushed his European interlocutors to urge an immediate ceasefire, which by extension would leave parts of Ukraine in Russia's control. ""I immediately contacted my colleagues in the capitals (Li) visited, and all of them confirmed there had been no talks or negotiations about recognizing as Russia those territories (it currently controls) in Ukraine,"" Kuleba said in a video message on his Facebook page. ""No one will do anything against us behind Ukraine's back, because we have built trusting relationships with all our key partners,"" he added. When asked about the news report in a press briefing Monday, Mao from China's Foreign Ministry denied the Wall Street Journal's characterization of Li's meetings and pointed instead China's own readouts from the meetings. While China may have limited sway when it comes to changing views on the conditions of peace, observers say Meanwhile, there remains hope that China could use its relationship with the Kremlin to push Putin toward peace -- a view that most recently was ""The visit is of value for the Europeans because they can use Li to deliver a message directly to the leadership in Beijing -- and potentially to Moscow. Li has a direct line to Xi Jinping, and he might be better equipped to get through to Xi than the personnel of Chinese embassies in Germany, France, or Poland,"" said Moritz Rudolf, a fellow and research scholar at the Paul Tsai China Center of the Yale Law School in the US. ""The crucial question is what message from Europe -- Kyiv, Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, and Brussels -- Li will deliver in Moscow and Beijing,"" he said.","China says it wants peace in Ukraine, but is it only on Russia's terms?"
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/04/middleeast/saudi-ukraine-peace-forum-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN  Yet, the desert kingdom's king-in-waiting, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - MBS for short - thinks he can help. Last fall he had a role in the release of Western foreign fighters captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine. Now he is Ukrainian officials say the venue is a boon for them ""that completely destroys the narrative of Russia"" that Ukraine is only supported by ""countries of the collective West."" They expect as many as 40 nations to be represented, including the US and India. In the days ahead of the summit, the Ukrainians set out their intent. ""Our goal in Saudi Arabia is to develop a unified vision of the formula and to work out the possibilities of holding the future That Moscow will only ""monitor"" and not attend risks the summit becoming a desert snowflake, momentarily awesome and inspiring, but blink and it's gone. Even so Ukrainian officials are pinning their hopes on it, ""to unite the world around Ukraine."" The White House is sending National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. US State Department officials are billing it as ""Ukraine in the driver's seat,"" an opportunity to find a ""potential diplomatic resolution to the war"" and for nations who might otherwise not hear directly from Kyiv to talk face-to-face with Ukrainian officials. The first session of this series was quietly hosted by the Danes in June, and gathered 15 nations, many from the global south whom to varying degrees are sympathetic to Putin's argument the war was ""necessary,"" that NATO forced him to invade Ukraine. That summit produced no major headlines, nor a discernable drift to Ukraine's prerequisite for peace that Russian troops exit Ukraine. So what is different this time? For one, Saudi Arabia, unlike Denmark, has not overtly taken a side in the war. More significantly MBS has leverage. Like the roads that led to Rome in its day, Saudi Arabia is increasingly at the confluence of President Biden came in July last year, Biden was able to build on their shared diplomatic achievement, a In spring this year, Saudi Arabia and China announced a confidence-building peace plan with Iran to repair their hostile relationship. So far it has worked. Iran's proxies in Yemen, the Houthis, have stopped attacking Saudi with Iranian-made ballistic missiles. The two nations have reopened diplomatic missions in their respective capitals and come fall will likely extend their newfound cooperation into commerce. What MBS wants most is a stable oil market and stronger trade relations throughout the Gulf. Disagreements in the region alone are dangerous. The war - between oil-rich, nuclear-armed Russia and Ukraine - could be catastrophic. If he can tame that tiger, he can better plan how to deliver his otherworldly and insanely His ambition is what drives him every day. In his ideal world, Saudi Arabia would be a dominant geopolitical player. Part of Biden's pitch to MBS when they met last year was: Don't cut oil production, it hurts my citizens at the gas pumps at home, and by the way, helps Russia fund its war in Ukraine by driving up oil prices. So what did MBS do a few months later? Cut oil production. Saudi officials say they are reading the oil markets correctly and only changed production to suit their own ""national interests."" That point didn't go down so well in Washington. Yet today the cardinal law of diplomacy would say MBS has potential leverage over Russia. If the Saudi potentate can raise oil prices he could also lower them. Not to say that he will, but he could, and Putin will know that too. The sort of diplomacy MBS is involved in is reimagining the role of Gulf Arabs. Stakeholders with real clout, not the rivals at each other's throats of yesteryear. It's a work in progress, but he sees where he wants to go and part of that involves one of the Middle East's thorniest issues: Saudi's rapprochement with On that, Saudi negotiations with the US are underway, and reportedly include domestic energy nuclear power plants, F-35 fighter aircraft and security guarantees for the desert kingdom. The US wants compromises from the Saudis, and vice versa. All of this of course is way outside the scope of the Jeddah peace summit and Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine. Yet it shows where there are a lot of pieces in flux, a cornucopia of potential quid pro quos, and growing possibilities of what can be achieved. Not least, as Ukraine's biggest backer, US appreciation that Saudi stepped off the diplomatic sidelines to help Zelensky. There are other areas beyond Iran where China and Saudi interests align, not least their mutual concerns about the risks to their economies of an untamed war escalating out of control on the edge of one of their biggest markets, Europe. Without China's economic support, Russia's economy and its ability to wage war in Ukraine could crumble. To a lesser extent some of the global south nations who may be around the table in Jeddah also help prop up Putin's war by buying gas, oil and other commodities he can no longer sell in Europe. It is exactly these countries the Ukrainians most want to impress with President Volodymyr Zelensky's 10-point peace initiative in Jeddah. Although it was published in December last year they think it has been rubbished by Russian propaganda and hope to reverse the damage. Only last week Putin ignored his own illegal invasion and blamed Ukraine for a lack of peace when African Union representatives at a Kremlin-sponsored Africa conference in St Petersburg pressed him to seek a ceasefire. In a typical Kremlinesque inversion of logic and reality, he told them that ""in order to start the process an agreement is needed from both sides,"" that ""a ceasefire is hard to implement when the Ukrainian army is on the offensive."" Countering Putin's revisionist lies will likely keep Ukraine's representatives in Jeddah extremely busy, with officials saying they plan to meet individually and collectively with other delegates about ""each point of the [10-point] Peace Formula.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/15/world/us-saudi-china-relations-intl/index.html,"CNN With a grandiose diplomatic flourish While the United States has angered its Gulf allies by apparently dithering over morality, curbing arms supplies and chilling relations, Saudi Arabia's King-in-waiting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, has found a kindred spirit in China's leader Xi Jinping. Both are bold, assertive, willing to take risks and seemingly share unsated ambition. Friday's announcement that Riyadh and Tehran had Beijing's claim that ""China pursues no selfish interest whatsoever in the Middle East,"" rings hollow. It buys more oil from Saudi Arabia than any other country in the world. Xi needs energy to grow China's economy, ensure stability at home and fuel its rise as a global power. His other main supplier, Russia, is at war, its supplies therefore in question. By de-escalating tensions between Saudi and Iran, Xi is not only shoring up his energy alternatives but, in a climate of growing tension with the US, also heading off potential curbs on his access to Gulf oil. Xi's motivation appears fueled by wider interests, but even so the US State Department welcomed the surprise move, spokesman Ned Price saying, ""we support anything that would serve to deescalate tensions in the region, and potentially help to prevent conflict."" Iran has buy-in because China has economic leverage. In 2021 the pair signed a trade deal reportedly worth up to $400 billion of Chinese investment over 25 years, in exchange for a steady supply of Iranian oil. Tehran is isolated by international sanctions and Beijing is providing a glimmer of financial relief. And, in the words of Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last year, there's also the hope of more to come as he sees geopolitical power shifting east. ""Asia will become the center of knowledge, the center of economics, as well as the center of political power, and the center of military power,"" Khamenei said. Saudi has buy-in because war with Iran would wreck its economy and ruin MBS's play for regional dominance. His bold visions for the country's post fossil-fuel future and domestic stability depend on inwardly investing robust oil and gas revenues. US influence on the wane It may sound simple, but the fact the US couldn't pull it off speaks to the complexities and nuance of everything that's been brewing over the past two decades. America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have burned through a good part of its diplomatic capital in the Middle East. Many in the Gulf see the development of the war in Ukraine as an unnecessary and dangerous American adventure, and some of Russian President Vladimir Putin's territorial claims over Ukraine not without merit. What the global West sees as a fight for democratic values lacks resonance among the Gulf autocracies, and the conflict doesn't consume them in the same way as it does leaders in European capitals. Saudi Arabia, and MBS in particular, have become particularly frustrated with America's flip-flop diplomacy: dialling back relations over the Crown Prince's role in the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi (which MBS denies); then calling on him to cut oil production swiftly followed by requests to increase it. These inconsistencies have led the Saudis to hew policy to their national interests and less to America's needs. During his visit to Saudi last July, China steps up On Beijing's part, China's Gulf intervention signals its own needs, and the opportunity to act arrived in a single serving. Xi helped himself because he can. The Chinese leader is a risk taker. His abrupt ending of austere Covid-19 pandemic restrictions at home is just one example, but this is a more complex roll of the dice. Mediation in the Middle East can be a poisoned chalice, but as big as the potential gains are for China, the wider implications for the regional, and even global order, are quantifiably bigger and will resonate for years. Yet harbingers of this shake-up and the scale of its impact have been in plain sight for months. Xi's high-profile, red-carpet reception in Riyadh last December for his first overseas visit after abandoning his domestic ""zero-Covid"" policy stirred the waters. During that trip Saudi and Chinese officials signed scores of deals worth tens of billions of dollars. China's Foreign Ministry trumpeted Xi's visit, paying particular attention to one particular infrastructure project: ""China will deepen industrial and infrastructure cooperation with Saudi Arabia (and) advance the development of the China-Saudi Arabia (Jizan) Industrial Park."" The Jizan project, part of China's belt and road initiative, heralds huge investment around the ancient Red Sea port, currently Saudi's third largest. Jizan lies close to the border with Yemen, the scene of a bloody civil war and proxy battle between Riyadh and Tehran since 2014, sparking what the United Nations has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Significantly since Xi's visit, episodic attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Jizan have abated. There are other effects too: the plans to upscale Jizan's container handling puts Saudi in greater competition with the UAE's container ports and potentially strains another regional rivalry, as MBS drives to become the dominant regional power, usurping UAE's role as regional hub for global businesses. Xi will have an interest seeing both Saudi Arabia and the UAE prosper, but Saudi is by far the bigger partner with higher potential global economic heft and, importantly, massive religious clout in the Islamic world. Rivals share common ground on Iran policy Where the UAE and Saudi align strongly is eschewing direct conflict with Tehran. A deadly drone attack in A once shaky ceasefire in Yemen now also seems to be moving toward peace talks, perhaps yet another indication of the potential of China's influence in the region. Beijing is acutely aware of what a continued war over the Persian Gulf could cost its commercial interests - another reason why a Saudi/Iran rapprochement makes sense to Xi. Iran blames Saudi for stoking the massive street protests through its towns and cities since September. Saudi denies that accusation, but when Iran moved drones and long-range missiles close to its Gulf coast and Saudi, Riyadh called on its friends to ask Tehran to de-escalate. Russia and China did, the threat dissipated. Questions remain over nuclear weapons Tehran, despite US diplomatic efforts, is also closing in on nuclear weapons capability and Saudi's MBS is on record saying he'll ensure parity, ""if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible."" Late last week US officials said Saudi was seeking US security guarantees and help developing a civilian nuclear program as part of a deal to normalize relations with Israel, an avowed enemy of Iran's Ayatollahs. Indeed, when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel late January, concerned over a rising Palestinian death toll in a violent year in the region, potential settlement expansions and controversial changes to Israel's judiciary Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Blinken about ""expanding the circle of peace,"" and improving relations with Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia. But as Saudi seems to shift closer to Tehran, Netanyahu's mission just got harder. While both Saudi and Israel strongly oppose a nuclear-armed Iran, only Netanyahu seems ready to confront Tehran. ""My policy is to do everything within Israel's power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons,"" the Israeli leader told Blinken. Riyadh favors diplomacy. As recently as last week the Saudi foreign minister said: ""It's absolutely critical ... that we find and an alternative pathway to ensuring an (Iranian) civilian nuclear program."" By improving ties with Tehran, he said, ""we can make it quite clear to the Iranians that this is not just a concerns of distant countries but it's also a concern of its neighbors."" For years this is what America did, such as brokering the Iran nuclear deal, or JCPOA, in 2015. Xi backed that deal, the Saudis didn't want it, Iran never trusted it, Biden's predecessor Donald Trump's withdrawal confirmed Iran's fears and sealed its fate, despite the ongoing proximity talks to get American diplomats seated at the table again. Iran has raced ahead in the meantime, massively over-running the bounds of the JCPOA limits on uranium enrichment and producing almost weapons-grade material. What's worse for Washington is that Trump's JCPOA withdrawal legacy tainted international perceptions of US commitment, continuity and diplomacy. All these circumstances perhaps signaled to Xi that his time to seize the lead on global diplomacy was coming. Yet the Chinese leader seems to accept what Netanyahu won't and what US diplomacy is unable to prevent: that sooner, rather than later, Iran will have a nuclear weapon. As such, Xi may be fostering Saudi-Iran rapprochement as a hedge against that day. So Netanyahu looks increasingly isolated and the Israeli leader, already under huge domestic pressure from spiking tensions with Palestinians and huge Israeli protests over his proposed judicial reforms, now faces a massive re-think on regional security. Pieces of regional puzzle shifting The working assumption of American diplomatic regional primacy is broken, and Netanyahu's biggest ally is now not as hegemonic as he needs. But by how much is still far from clear. It's not a knockout, but a gut blow, to Washington. How Xi calculates the situation isn't clear either. The US is not finished, far from it, but it is diminished, and both powers are coexisting in a different way now. Earlier this month, the Chinese leader made unusually direct comments accusing the US of leading a campaign against China and causing serious domestic woes. ""Western countries led by the United States have contained and suppressed us in an all-round way, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our development,"" Xi told a group of government advisers representing private businesses on the sidelines of an annual legislative meeting in Beijing. Meanwhile, Biden has defined the future US-China relationship as ""competition not confrontation,"" and he has built his foreign policy around the tenets of standing up for democracy. It is striking that neither Xi, nor Khamenei, nor MBS are troubled by the moral dilemmas that circumscribe Biden. This is the big challenge the US president warned about, and now it's here. An alternative world order, irrespective of what happens in Ukraine.",China has shattered the assumption of US dominance in the Middle East

Italy-based ""We are very proud to say that we are the only company providing the snow-making systems for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"" Michael Mayr, TechnoAlpin Asia area manager, told CNN. Mayr said it is the first time a single company has been tasked with providing all the snow for the Winter Games. But there's a critical component to making snow that some of the Beijing sites also lack: temperatures cold enough to freeze water. In Beijing itself, which will host a few outdoor events, nearly all February days for the past 30 years have been above freezing, according to a recent Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, which are higher elevation venues, are cooler, with average high temperatures that peak above freezing and lows that fall to around -10 degrees Celsius at night. ""There have been recent technological advances that allow for the generation of snow when it is above freezing,"" explained Jordy Hendrikx, the director of the Snow and Avalanche Laboratory at Montana State University. ""This is not your 'light fluffy' snow that you might think of - it is much denser and not very soft."" Ice makers 'on steroids' Traditionally, snow-making has relied heavily on snow guns and temperatures at or below freezing. To accommodate warmer temperatures and lower elevations, a different approach needs to be taken. To work around Mother Nature, TechnoAlpin told CNN that it began shipping a full arsenal of snow guns, fan-driven snow generators and cooling towers to Beijing in 2018. Among those machines was a new piece of technology used at a training center for China's athletes: the ""Think of it like a very sophisticated version of the ice maker in your refrigerator,"" said Hendrikx. ""But then on steroids."" Making snow demands significant resources, namely energy and water. ""Obviously we need more energy the warmer it gets,"" Mayr said.

The International Olympic Committee estimated that 'This is dangerous' Athletes have also expressed concern about the hazards of competing at high levels on artificial snow. French cross-country skier Clement Parisse, the bronze medal winner at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, told CNN that while it's not uncommon to have to compete on human-made snow, it tends to become very slick and icy, which presents added challenges. And Laura Donaldson, a freestyle skier from Scotland who competed in Salt Lake City in 2002, was extremely critical of artificial snow. ""If freestyle super pipes are formed from snow-making machines in a poor season, the walls of the pipe are solid, vertical ice and the pipe floor is solid ice,"" Donaldson told researchers for the Slippery Slopes report. ""This is dangerous for athletes, some have died."" The IOC does not face these challenges alone. Artificial snow is being used as a tool to extend ski seasons in competitions and at resorts across the globe, many of which are threatened by the warming temperatures of the climate crisis. These challenges will continue to drive the snow sports industry toward artificial snow when Mother Nature doesn't produce it.

A But the threat is not distributed evenly, nor is it being approached everywhere with Using new flood risk data from First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research group, CNN ranked the top 10 congressional districts where critical infrastructure is most at-risk to flooding. Six out of 10 of the House lawmakers that represent those districts voted against the recently signed bipartisan infrastructure law, which contains around $50 billion to help make particularly vulnerable communities Those same six lawmakers also voted against President Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan, which has yet to pass the Senate and includes more than $500 billion in climate and green energy provisions. If passed, it would be the The votes were split along party lines, with Democrats voting in favor of the bills and Republicans voting against. Nine of the lawmakers represent low-lying coastal areas in Louisiana, Florida and Texas. One of the lawmakers represents a district in California at-risk to flooding from atmospheric rivers. While Republicans have widely continued to cast doubt on the science of climate change, Democrats are more keen than ever to point to the connection between the climate crisis and deadly extreme weather, which costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year. Here's how lawmakers who represent America's most at-risk districts voted on the two critical climate bills and where they stand on the climate crisis.  In addition to storm surge from hurricanes, the Miami-area district is particularly susceptible to    ""Climate change is real, and the evidence is right here in Miami,"" Salazar's Salazar's  Ida in August was the latest major hurricane to make landfall in the Louisiana 1st.

However, when asked by CNN's Rene Marsh in November ""For years, he's pushed to preserve and increase the annual offshore oil and gas revenue sharing dollars that Louisiana receives for coastal restoration and hurricane protection ... which has provided over $400 million to Louisiana in the last four years alone,"" Lovell said, calling the funding ""critical for protecting our coastal communities from powerful Gulf storms.""  The most devastating example of flooding in Garcia's district came in 2017, when    ""While we must prepare for worse hurricanes in the future, we also need to be planning on how to reduce greenhouse gases that drive climate change and ultimately greater storm intensity,"" Garcia said in a 2020 statement on her website. Garcia did not respond to CNN's questions for this story.  For example, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Donalds' district in 2017 and    ""They're not tied together and I think putting them together as I believe is the wrong approach,"" he said in an interview. ""If you pulled out the resiliency projects, infrastructure projects of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, (and) you put on the House floor for a vote, it would pass overwhelmingly. It will pass overwhelmingly in the Senate."" ""I think with where we are with respect to climate is not so much for Congress to act. Every developed nation in the world has to come to an area or a place where we can agree this is the best path forward,"" Donalds said. ""I think it's an urgent 'Congress-must-get-out-of-the-way' matter, so our economy and our energy suppliers can actually get to a place where we can have sustainable energy, which is more efficient and actually protects our climate, our planet.""  Southeast Texas is experiencing one of the highest rates of sea level rise in the country, And the sea level rise exacerbates hurricane storm surge.

Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that drought months are becoming the new normal, with rainy months becoming fewer and farther between. Climate researchers say two major factors contributed to this summer's severe drought: the lack of precipitation and an increase in evaporative demand, also known as the ""thirst of the atmosphere."" Warmer temperatures increase the amount of water the atmosphere can absorb, which then dries out the landscape and primes the environment for wildfires. ""As we're getting these very extreme heat waves, it's just making the drought even worse, even though drought is initially caused by the lack of precipitation,"" Julie Kalansky, a climate scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, Based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index, July 2021 was the driest month on record in California since records began in 1895. June, July and August were three out of the states five driest months on record. The index, also known as the PDSI, takes into account precipitation, runoff and how much moisture is evaporating out of the ground. It is used widely by scientists and researchers and is and a key factor that informs the weekly report of the US Drought Monitor. On the PDSI scale, anything below -4.0 is considered ""extreme drought."" California's PDSI this summer ranged from -6.7 in June to -7.07 in July. This summer tied the Dust Bowl summer in 1936 for the hottest on record in the US. It was also the hottest summer on record in California, where the persistent heat pushed The prolonged drought California is experiencing began in 2012. Since then, wet months have been rare, with just two notable wet periods: Winter 2016-2017 and Spring 2019. Before this year, 2014 held the record for the most extreme drought conditions, with June and July that year facing similar circumstances as today. Scientists Justin Mankin, assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College and co-lead of NOAA's Drought Task Force, ""The longer-term fate of this particular drought is murky, even though we expect more droughts to look like this one in the years to come,"" he said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/11/weather/infrastructure-flood-risk-climate-first-street/index.html,"CNN As a massive investment to repair roads and adapt to climate change faces an uncertain fate in Congress, a new report finds much of the country's infrastructure is already at risk of being shut down by flooding. And as the planet heats up, the threat is expected to grow. Today, one-in-four pieces of all critical infrastructure in the US -- including police and fire stations, hospitals, airports and wastewater treatment facilities -- face substantial risk of being rendered inoperable by flooding, according to a new report released today by the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research and technology group that assesses the threat posed by flooding across the country. The report also found nearly 2 million miles of road -- 23% of US roadways -- are already at risk of becoming impassable due to flooding. To provide what First Street says is the fullest picture to date of community-level flood vulnerability, the researchers examined five categories across the Lower 48 and the District of Columbia: Critical infrastructure; social infrastructure, including museums, government buildings and schools; roads; commercial properties; and residential properties. The report used estimates of operational flood risk from official governing bodies to determine the amount of inundation it would take to knock different types of facilities or services offline. The researchers then overlaid the kinds of flood events that can be expected in an area at least once every two years to gauge community risk. First Street's past reports have focused on the ""Even if your home is safe and secure from a specific intensity of flooding, if flooding is becoming more common and destructive in your community, your property value may be threatened too,"" said Hamed Moftakhari, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the University of Alabama, who was not involved with the First Street report. Where flood risk is greatest today If there is a ground zero for flood danger in the US, it is Louisiana. The state is home to six of the top 20 most at-risk counties in the country. Cameron Parish in southwest Louisiana is the most vulnerable county in the US, followed closely by Orleans Parish, which includes New Orleans. Jeremy Porter, First Street's head of research and development, said while New Orleans has adapted its infrastructure and levees to hold off stronger storms, continued sea level rise and more destructive hurricanes could eventually overwhelm the city's current defenses. ""It's going to have to continually be updated as the environment changes in the future,"" Porter said. ""The infrastructure that's in place today isn't going to protect New Orleans in five, 10, 15 years. That's only going to get worse as sea level rises, as storms not only become more frequent but become stronger."" In both Cameron and Orleans Parish, the report finds more than 94% of all critical infrastructure -- including police and fire stations, which are critical to emergency response operations after disasters like hurricanes -- are at risk of being knocked offline. Florida is also home to some of the most flood-prone counties in the country, but flood risk isn't confined to coastal areas. Many areas in Appalachia, like McDowell County in West Virginia and Johnson County in Kentucky, are also among the most at-risk because of the growing threat of heavy rain, the First Street researchers said. As the planet warms due to human-caused climate change, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, which makes extreme rainfall events dumping massive amounts of water in short periods of time more likely. Flooding is already the most common and costly disaster in the US, ""Because of the impacts of climate change, there are communities across the US that are going to have tough decisions in the years to come because of sea level rise and intensity of storms,"" Maurstad told CNN. ""It's not just the coast of Louisiana.""

The But some of Cassidy's fellow Republicans in the House and Senate disagree. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who represents three out of the report's top five communities in the US with the most flood risk, Louisiana's lone Democratic member of Congress, Rep. Troy Carter, told CNN in a statement he wants to see the infrastructure bill passed. ""I remain hopeful that our Louisiana delegation will not throw the bipartisan history of infrastructure negotiations out the window,"" Carter told CNN. ""I'm grateful that Sen. Cassidy stands with me in this effort. I don't plan to return to my constituents empty-handed."" Spokespeople for Scalise and Rep. Clay Higgins -- a Republican who represents Cameron Parish -- didn't return CNN's requests for comment on how they would prefer help flood-prone communities in their districts. It's going to get worse The threat of flooding is growing rapidly in the United States. A series of devastating floods this summer killed dozens of people and caused billions of dollars in damages from And as global warming melts ice sheets, Over the next 30 years, the number of residential properties at risk of flooding is expected to grow from 12.4 million today to 13.6 million by 2051, the report says. For critical infrastructure and commercial properties, the number of vulnerable facilities are projected to grow by 6% and 7% respectively over the next three decades. Geographically speaking, the report found flood threats will increase most along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, but significant increases in vulnerability are also projected across large portions of the Pacific Northwest.","25% of all critical infrastructure in the US is at risk of failure due to flooding, new report finds"

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/04/americas/worlds-biggest-iceberg-a68a-intl/index.html,"CNN One of the world's largest icebergs is on a collision course with a South Atlantic island oasis, potentially threatening a rich The ""A68a"" iceberg, which broke off from If the 4,700 square kilometer (1,815 square mile) mass - greater than South Georgia itself - stays on its current path and reaches the island's shores, scientists fear it could have a devastating effect on its wildlife populations for years to come. Professor Geraint Tarling, Senior Biological Oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), told CNN that the iceberg could block seals and penguins from being able to access their normal feeding grounds at a time of year that is crucial for the colonies' growth. ""If they have to make massive detours around the iceberg to make the same trip they normally would, they likely won't be able to get back in time (to feed their young),"" Tarling explained. And because the iceberg is so huge, it could remain stuck on the island's doorstep for years, potentially leading to catastrophic marine life population failure, he added. Currently traveling at a speed of around 1 kilometer per hour, A68a could reach the British Overseas Territory in as little as three to four weeks if it travels in a straight line, Tarling said - though he explained that it was likely to take a more circuitous route. South Georgia and the neighboring South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) are home to approximately 5 million seals of four different species. Its surrounding waters serve as an important habitat for migrating whales and diverse fish populations, As the iceberg moves closer to shore, it will ""scour"" the seafloor, killing off the diverse marine life that plays a critical role in balancing the global climate. That's because that marine life acts as a carbon sink. But if that wildlife is disturbed, the carbon will release into the water and ultimately into the atmosphere, Tarling explained, with the potential to ""upset the balance for years to come."" Scientists who have followed the A68a since it ""calved"" away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf more than three years ago say they are surprised by how intact it has stayed throughout its journey north. Adrian Luckman, a glaciologist and professor of geology at  Swansea University told CNN that the ""area-to-thickness ratio of A68a is approximately the same as a few sheets of copier paper stuck together, so it is remarkable that it has stayed pretty much intact despite over three years of drifting in the Southern Ocean."" It has only been in the last year that the iceberg has picked up considerable pace, even acting as a positive fertilizing force as it makes its way through the ocean. In open water, the iceberg is accumulating significant amounts of dust from the atmosphere that act as essential nutrients that open waters lack. But as soon as that mass hits the island's shallow waters, it will have the opposite effect. Shallow waters are already heavily fertilized and the iceberg's excess fresh water and shading will prevent the growth of marine algae - the fuel that so much of that biodiverse marine life depends on. While icebergs calving from glaciers is a natural process, the rate of melting and calving is getting faster.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/09/weather/thwaites-glacier-antarctica-scli-intl/index.html,"CNN Deep channels discovered under the The findings Ice draining from the gigantic Thwaites Glacier into the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica already accounts for about 4% of global sea-level rise, and scientists say it is highly susceptible to climate change. Over the past three decades, the rate of ice loss from Thwaites, which is about the size of Great Britain or the US state of Florida, and its neighboring glaciers has increased more than five-fold. If Thwaites were to collapse, it could lead to an increase in sea levels of around 25 inches (64 centimeters) - and the researchers are trying to find out how soon this is likely to happen. Scientists from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC) collected data by flying over the glacier in a British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Twin Otter aircraft and mapping the sea floor from the US Antarctic Program icebreaker RV Nathaniel B. Palmer. The cavities hidden beneath the ice shelf are likely to be the route through which warm ocean water passes underneath the ice shelf up to the grounding line, they said. ""Thwaites Glacier itself is probably one of the most significant glaciers in West Antarctica, because it's so large, because we can see it's changing today,"" Dr. Tom Jordan, an aero-geophysicist at BAS who led the airborne survey, told CNN. ""And also, we know that its bed dips down, and it gets deeper and deeper underneath the ice sheet, which means that, theoretically, you can get a process called marine ice sheet instability. And once it starts to retreat, it will just keep retreating."" Jordan said the next phase was to incorporate the data from the channels, some of them 2,600 feet (800 meters) deep, into simulations of how the ice sheet will respond into the future. Before now, he said, the ITGC has not been able to precisely quantify sea-level rise in West Antarctica ""because there was so much uncertainty about understanding the ice sheet processes and how the glaciers will over time respond."" ""I think this is a big step towards helping understand that,"" he added. Jordan said that suggestions of geoengineering and blocking the channels is not logistically feasible at such a remote site. A simpler solution would be to ""tackle climate change."" ""At the end, we will be able to say to governments and policy-makers, this is what's going to happen ... we will actually have a proper, well-constrained estimate of what's going to happen to Thwaites Glacier,"" said Jordan. Once scientists can demonstrate the expected sea-level rise relating to West Antarctica, he said, they will have more evidence when calling for action to mitigate climate change. The team collected data from the glacier and adjoining Dotson and Crosson ice shelves from January to March 2019. Exceptional sea-ice break up in early 2019 enabled the icebreaker to survey more than 2,000 square kilometers of sea floor at the glacier's ice front. The area surveyed had been hidden beneath part of the floating ice shelf extending from Thwaites Glacier, which broke off in 2002, and was then often inaccessible due to thick sea-ice cover.",Antarctica's colossal Thwaites Glacier is melting fast - and scientists may have discovered why

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/18/europe/ukraine-russia-conflict-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,"CNN Russia's multi-pronged After months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia's side of the border, Ukraine's 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a Russia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. Frenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country. The escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow. So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know. How did Russia invade Ukraine? Several areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms. The move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops In late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally. Some of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv. Missile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania. Russia's larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow's attempts. That resistance has been ""stiffer than expected"" and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated. But US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance. The US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin's move. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg And a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia's economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked. The coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine.  Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future - crossing a red line for Russia. Putin has seen NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act"" - a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia. In interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in  In a lengthy That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty. But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet."" In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance. In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe - proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters. Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his  In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?"" The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 - which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine - have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved. Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the Putin previously responded in  President Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country. ""Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,"" Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page. Across the country, residents have been preparing for the worst - packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN. Zelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted ""urgently"" to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground. Delegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin's invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia. Ukraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. ""I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,"" he said Sunday, Tensions between the two countries had been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline - connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany - as a threat to its own security.  After requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would Nord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky's government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.

In a Critics decried the song as an attempt to indoctrinate children and instill in them loyalty for the Islamic Republic.

In videos on social media and seen by CNN, more protests now involve school children. ""There is another layer [to the demonstrations], which is the protests we have been seeing in schools,"" said Tara Sepehri Far, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, adding that it is ""unprecedented"" for Iran. The government has said it is sending underaged protesters to mental health centers. In an interview with a reformist Iranian newspaper, Iran's Education Minister Yousef Nouri last week The mental health facilities act like detention centers, said Hossein Raeesi, an Iranian human rights lawyer and adjunct professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, adding that within the establishments, psychologists and social workers are following a strict government agenda and aren't allowed to work independently with the children. ""They don't provide psychological and psychosocial support for the kids,"" Raeesi told CNN, but rather ""brainwash"" them and often intimidate or threaten them. ""They come out worse than when they entered."" While the official did not say how many students have been detained so far, experts say that a large number of children are at risk as the protests have heavy youth participation. Sepehri Far of Human Rights Watch said authorities are finding it difficult to police underage demonstrators. While it is easy to criminalize adult protesters, violent crackdowns against children risk full-blown anger throughout the country, she added. Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, the deputy commander of the IRGC, placed the average age of those arrested in ""recent riots"" at 15 years old, reported the state news agency IRNA on October 5. The commander attributed the phenomenon to ""neglect of education."" Rights groups say the crackdown on children Between September 20 and September 30, rights watchdog Amnesty International documented the killing of at least 23 children, it said last week, sounding the alarm about an already violent crackdown that is now targeting children. According to Amnesty, ""most of the boys were killed by security forces unlawfully firing live ammunition at them,"" and ""three girls and a boy died after fatal beatings by security forces."" ""Two boys died after being shot with metal pellets at close range,"" it added. The watchdog said it has so far recorded the deaths of 144 men, women and children killed by Iran's security forces between September 19 and October 3. Overall, 16% of deaths are children, said Amnesty, adding that the real number of total deaths is estimated to be higher. CNN cannot independently verify the death toll. On Sunday, video obtained by CNN from the pro-reform activist outlet IranWire showed high school students in Tehran's Narmak area protesting and chanting ""Death to the dictator."" On Friday and Saturday, high school girls were seen taking off their headscarves and protesting in the cities of Ardabil and Sanandaj, video obtained by CNN showed. Iran also witnessed protests in October by high school students in the northern city of Rasht, as well as in Ghaleh Hassan Khan, a town east of Tehran, according to video obtained by CNN. The United Nation's children agency UNICEF has also called for the protection of children and adolescents amid Iran's protests. ""The Iranian authorities' unrelenting brutal crackdown on what many in Iran consider an ongoing popular uprising against the Islamic Republic system has involved an all-out attack on child protesters,"" Nassim Papayianni, Amnesty International's senior campaigner on Iran, told CNN.

OPEC+ member states lined up on Sunday to endorse the steep production cut agreed this month after the White House accused Riyadh of coercing some other nations into supporting the move, Reuters reported. The kingdom's Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman said the October 5 decision to reduce output by 2 million barrels per day - taken despite oil markets being tight - was unanimous and based on economic factors. His comments were backed by ministers of several OPEC+ member states, including the United Arab Emirates.  Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh made a rare appearance in the West Bank refugee camp in Jenin - a militant stronghold where the Palestinian Authority has little control - on Sunday to show support for Palestinians, including militants, killed by the Israeli military.

Forty-nine years ago, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced that it was Dominated by Arab states, OPEC also extended the embargo to other Western states that supported Israel, including the Netherlands, Portugal and South Africa. The embargo came at a time when the oil market was already volatile, rocked by arguments and negotiations between oil-producing countries and oil companies. The OPEC decision included a ban on petroleum exports to the US and other states, but also an oil production cut. The consequences were dire. In just a few months, oil prices quadrupled, going from $2.90 a barrel before the embargo to $11.65 a barrel in January 1974, according to the US federal reserve history. The embargo severely strained the US economy, which at the time had relied heavily on foreign oil imports. The embargo also coincided with the devaluation of the dollar. A month later, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger began talks with Arab states. Negotiations led to the Egyptian-Israeli Disengagement Agreement of January 18, 1974. OPEC lifted the oil embargo in March of 1974.  ",Iran faces dilemma as children join protests in 'unprecedented' phenomenon

During the interview, Lukashenko said, ""no one minds Kazakhstan and other countries having the same close relations that we have with the Russian Federation."" ""It's very simple,"" he added. ""Join the Union State of Belarus and Russia. That's all: there will be nuclear weapons for everyone."" Signed in 1999, the Agreement on Establishment of the Union State of Belarus and Russia Treaty set up a legal basis for a wide-ranging alliance that spanned economic, information, technology, agriculture, and border security among other things between the two countries, according to the Belarus government website. It was not clear how wide Lukashenko's invitation to join the Union State extended, and he offered no other specifics. But his comments on handing out nuclear weapons to like-minded allies are likely to heighten concerns at a time of growing global proliferation and as Moscow threatens the world with its own atomic arsenal as its war against Ukraine falters. On Thursday the Belarusian autocrat said the ""It was necessary to prepare storage sites, and so on. We did all this. Therefore, the movement of nuclear weapons began,"" Lukashenko said, according to state news agency Belta. He also promised the safety of those weapons, saying: ""This is not even up for discussion. Don't worry about nuclear weapons. We are responsible for this. These are serious issues. Everything will be alright here."" Putin has said that Russia would retain control over any tactical nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus  and Belarus has had no nuclear weapons on its territory since the early 1990s. Shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it agreed to transfer all Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction stationed there to Russia. Since invading Ukraine more than a year ago, Putin has used escalating rhetoric on a number of occasions, warning of the ""increasing"" threat of nuclear war and suggesting Moscow may abandon its ""no first use"" policy. In March, Putin said Moscow will Tactical nuclear weapons are Strong condemnations The United States and the European Union, as well as opposition leaders in Belarus, have denounced the move to deploy Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. ""It's the latest example of irresponsible behavior that we have seen from Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine over a year ago,"" said US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday. Miller added that despite the report of the transfer, the US sees ""no reason to adjust our strategic nuclear posture"" and said there are no ""indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon."" The EU called the agreement between Moscow and Minsk ""a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation."" And Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted on Sunday that Lukashenko's words ""directly indicate that the Russian Federation is deliberately 'killing' the concept of global nuclear deterrence and 'burying' the key Global Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons."" ""This fundamentally undermines the principles of global security,"" Podolyak said. ""There can only be one solution: a tough stance of nuclear states; relevant UN/IAEA resolutions; extensive sanctions against (Russian state nuclear energy firm) Rosatom; systemic financial sanctions against Belarus and ultimately against Russia."" Members of the Belarusian opposition also slammed the agreement, with exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya saying in a post on Twitter ""we must do everything to prevent Putin's plan to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus."" ""It directly violates our constitutional non-nuclear status and would secure Russia's control over Belarus for years ahead. And it would further threaten the security of Ukraine and all of Europe,"" she said. Analysts say there are still a lot of unknowns with the transfer.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/11/middleeast/iran-saudi-arabia-normalization-china-analysis-intl/index.html,"CNN When The announcement was surprising yet expected. The two regional powerhouses have been in talks to re-establish diplomatic relations for nearly two years. At times, negotiators seemed to drag their feet, the deep distrust between the two countries appearing immovable. Iran's talks with Saudi Arabia were unfolding at the same time as negotiations between Iran and the United States to revive the 2016 nuclear deal were faltering. The outcomes of both sets of Iran talks seemed interlinked - Riyadh and Washington have long walked in lockstep on foreign policy. But a shift in regional alliances is afoot. Saudi Arabia's relationship with the US has become strained in recent years, while China's standing has risen. Unlike Washington, Beijing has shown an ability to transcend the many rivalries that criss-cross the Middle East. China has forged good diplomatic relations with countries across the region, driven by strengthening economic ties, without the Western lectures on human rights. In retrospect, Beijing has been poised to broker the conflict-ridden Middle East's latest diplomatic breakthrough for years, simultaneously underscoring the US' diminishing regional influence. ""While many in Washington will view China's emerging role as mediator in the Middle East as a threat, the reality is that a more stable Middle East where the Iranians and Saudis aren't at each other's throats also benefits the United States,"" Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Washington-based Quincy Institute, tweeted Friday. Parsi argues that the development should trigger a moment of introspection on Washington's Middle East policy. ""What should worry American decision-makers is if this becomes the new norm: the US becomes so deeply embroiled in the conflicts of our regional partners that our manoeuvrability evaporates and our past role as a peacemaker is completely ceded to China,"" he added. End of a dark era Friday's agreement could herald the end of a blood-drenched era in the Middle East. Riyadh and Tehran have been at ideological and military loggerheads since Iran's Islamic Revolution installed an anti-Western, Shia theocracy in 1979. Those tensions began to escalate into a region-wide proxy war after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq spiraled into civil conflict, with both Iran and Saudi Arabia vying for influence in the petrol-rich Arab country. Armed conflict that pitted Saudi-backed militants against Iran-backed armed groups washed over much of the region in the decade and a half that followed. In Yemen, a Saudi-led coalition military campaign to quash Iranian-backed rebels triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. In Syria, Iran supported President Bashar al-Assad as he brutalized his own people, only to find his forces facing off with rebels backed by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. In Lebanon too, Iran and Saudi Arabia have backed different factions, contributing to a two-decade-long political crisis that has exacted a huge economic and security toll on the tiny eastern Mediterranean country. Diplomatic relations were officially severed in 2016 when Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shia Saudi cleric Nimr al-Nimr, leading rioters in Tehran to torch the Saudi embassy. But a slew of economic problems triggered by the pandemic and costly wars may have eroded the appetite for conflict, and Saudi and Iranian officials say they are eager to turn the page on that dark chapter. The detente appears to go far beyond the resumption of diplomatic relations. Saudi and Iranian officials say they will also work to reimplement a decades-old security cooperation pact and revive an even older agreement on technology, and trade. It's a rare piece of good news for a region still reeling from their rivalry. How that plays out - and whether it can undo the havoc wreaked by the rivalry - remains to be seen. But analysts say that China's growing leverage in the region helped hedge both countries' bets, changing a now-outdated political calculus that once made Western capitals the most likely venue for watershed regional accords. ""China is now the godfather of this agreement and given China's strategic importance to Iran, that holds tremendous weight,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst familiar with the Saudi leadership's thinking, told CNN. ""If Iran were to break this agreement, it will be hurting its ties to China that has put its full prestige into the 'tripartite' agreement.""","Iran and Saudi Arabia signal the start of a new era, with China front and center"
https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/28/china/china-green-olympics-alpine-ski-nature-reserve-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"CNN China has touted its newly completed Olympic ski venue as an example of its commitment to making the But there's just one problem - it was built in the middle of a nature reserve. Chinese organizers say the National Alpine Ski Center in Yanqing, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) from central Beijing, will be According to satellite images and official maps analyzed by CNN, the ski center tears through the former core area of Songshan National Nature Reserve, a park founded in 1985 to protect its dense forests, alpine meadows and rich biodiversity. By the time Beijing won the bid for the 2022 Winter Games in 2015, the boundaries of the reserve had been redrawn to exclude the area where the ski field is now built. The new boundaries cover a larger total area, but critics say that's unlikely to compensate for the loss of wildlife habitat and damage to the site's delicate ecosystem from building the venue. This apparent conflict with Beijing's green narrative comes amid mounting questions about the environmental cost of the Games. Given the city's arid climate, it will rely entirely on artificial snow - which experts warn would be a drain on energy and And such environmental concerns won't end with the Olympics. As the Chinese government looks to turn Yanqing into an international skiing hotspot and build more ski slopes, conservationists fear it could cause further damage to the local ecology. The nature reserve For decades, Songshan National Nature Reserve provided a sanctuary to many protected animal and plant species, including the golden eagle and rare orchids. Under So The discovery sparked an outcry on social media, with many internet users questioning why the Olympics venue had to be built inside a nature reserve. Censors soon moved in, As pressure mounted, Zhang Suzhi, then executive deputy head of Yanqing county, That appears to be what Chinese organizers told the International Olympic Committee, too. In its But it noted that the proposed site is ""part of the same mountain ecosystem"" as the reserve, adding: ""Ski resort development in this area would therefore require substantial ecological studies and mitigation measures to limit environmental impact."" According to Zhang, the Yanqing official, the revised borders expanded the total area of the nature reserve by 31% and added more types of vegetation. ""After the adjustment, the nature reserve is richer in biological resources, more complete in ecosystem, stronger in water conservation and higher in conservation value,"" he But Zhang brushed over a crucial fact: the original core zone - including the highest peak, which experts say has the most biodiversity significance - was no longer part of the protected lands. 'This is really a great pity' Chinese experts and environmental activists say expanding the reserve doesn't compensate for the loss of the original core area. ""This is really a great pity, because (the original core zone) is one of the very few places in northern Beijing that has alpine meadows,"" said a Chinese ecological expert, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions. ""Such a unique ecosystem was why it was included in the original nature reserve in the first place."" And compared to other parts of the reserve, the core area also had a higher rate of wildlife sightings, according to a The Chinese ecologist criticized a lack of transparency in the government's decision-making. ""It did not release any environmental impact assessment for public consultation,"" the ecologist said. When construction of the National Alpine Ski Center began in 2017, environmentalists tried to seek answers. Environmental advocate Shi Dianshuo urged the government to release detailed information on the boundary change. The government rejected his request on the grounds that the information ""involves state secrets,"" according to a notice issued by the Ministry of Environmental Protection posted by Shi online. Unconvinced, Shi took the ministry to court to have the decision overturned. A court date was originally scheduled for February 2018, but a source with direct knowledge of the case told CNN the hearing did not proceed, nor was it acknowledged by the government or mentioned anywhere in state media. Shi declined CNN's request for an interview. To observe the disruptive impact of the ski slopes' construction on wildlife, researchers at the reserve's management office set up cameras throughout the new reserve in 2017 to monitor their activity. ""As the reserve is adjacent to the Yanqing competition zone, human activities have increased dramatically, and road transport and constructions have affected the population size and behavioral rhythm of wild animals in the area,"" the The researchers found that nocturnal animals, such as leopard cats and greater hog badgers, had become much more active during the day - likely to avoid construction work at the ski slopes. In a Pre-Games Sustainability Report released this month, Chinese Olympic officials highlighted conservation efforts during construction of the Yanqing competition zone. They included setting up wildlife corridors and But experts noted that the Songshan National Nature Reserve went entirely unmentioned in the 130-page report. ""Nowhere is the word 'nature reserve' mentioned and nowhere is it said that the core area ... has been declassified and transferred to a new area,"" said Carmen de Jong, a geographer at the University of Strasbourg. ""If you're destroying the upper high-altitude mountain parts, it's no use to try and cue in the lower parts, because you have impacted the very, very sensitive ecosystem,"" she added. The Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment did not respond to CNN's request for comments about the boundary change. One of the world's steepest runs It's clear why Xiao Haituo mountain in the reserve To hold an Olympic downhill event, the proposed ski site must have a vertical drop of The city of Zhangjiakou, for example, is already well developed for winter sports and a popular skiing destination in China. ""If it's just for holding the Olympics, a lot of ski resorts in Hebei are good enough, there's no need to touch the nature reserve at all,"" the Chinese ecologist said. Instead, he suspects, economic considerations may be at play. ""Beijing doesn't want the future winter sports revenue to be diverted to Hebei,"" he said. The Beijing Organizing Committee did not respond to CNN's request for comment over whether it was aware the ski center was built inside the former core area of the nature reserve. In a reply to CNN, the IOC said the development of the Yanqing zone is ""transforming the region - a rural suburb of Beijing - into a major four-season tourism destination, improving lives and boosting the local economy."" The IOC - which has pledged to make the Games climate positive by 2024 - also Saving wildlife Beijing's ambitions for Yanqing are not limited to the Olympics. It has already However, conservationists fear that future development could cause even more damage to the surrounding forests and wildlife. ""The increase in the number of people is what will cause great pressure on the local ecology, which is the biggest concern,"" said a Chinese expert who didn't want to be named due to fear of repercussions. Luo Shujin, a conservation biologist at Peking University, has been studying wildlife around Yanqing for years. She was tracking leopard cat droppings on another mountain in Yanqing in December 2018 when she saw the ski runs gleaming in the sun across the valley. Luo was excited: ""I thought about that famous pictures of a puma walking by the Hollywood sign in L.A., and I asked myself: can we get a picture of a leopard cat walking by the alpine ski course of the Beijing Winter Olympics?"" Due to the pandemic, Luo couldn't access the mountain for more than a year. When she finally returned in 2021, she got the shot she wanted. In the photo, a leopard cat strolls casually into the frame of the It ended up going viral. Conservationists saw it as a sign that within miles of the ski resort, rare wild animals could still thrive. But their future remains uncertain. If Yanqing's ski slopes continue to expand, analysts say it could threaten the surrounding ecosystems - including the existing nature reserve. ""A nature reserve should be protected exactly because it has a fragile ecosystem,"" the Chinese expert said. ""Given how close the skiing venue is to nature reserve, if a large amount of human activities go on for a long time, they are bound to cause great disturbance to the local ecology ... and might even break the balance.""",China claims to be holding the greenest Olympics.

The Olympic flame has made its final journey to the heart of Beijing, lighting up the night sky. Defying a raging pandemic and months of international controversy, the Sealed off from its host city by a labyrinth of high fences, thermal gates and facial-recognition cameras, this is sure to be an Olympics like no other. Politics, protests and Covid protocols have become an unavoidable part of the build-up to these Games, and if anything, events taking place outside the sporting arena throughout the next two weeks will receive as much attention as actions on the ice and snow. How China responds will be a major test for the country's leader Xi Jinping, who is gearing up for an unprecedented third term in power this fall. ""The world is turning its eyes to China, and China is ready,"" Xi said Thursday ahead of the opening ceremony. For China's ruling Communist Party, the Games will offer a moment of national triumph, as Beijing becomes the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. It is also the first major global event inside of China since the country shut its borders two years ago in the wake of the initial coronavirus outbreak. But among the Chinese public, enthusiasm for the Winter Games pales in comparison with 2008, when residents gathered in their thousands across Beijing to watch the Summer Olympics opening ceremony on large public screens, eager to be a part of history. This year, few viewing parties took place in a capital subdued by heavy-handed snap lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions. ""I think the Games are going to be declared a great success by the Communist Party - whether it's gonna be perceived as such by other nations is another issue,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. Defending the bubble In a bid to keep the Games Covid-free - and to prevent the virus from spreading into the wider population - Chinese authorities have constructed a vast network of bubbles, known officially as the ""closed loop,"" that separates the Games from the host city. Already, more than 300 coronavirus cases - about a third of them linked to athletes and team officials - have been detected in Beijing's recent Olympic arrivals, including Inside the bubble, Covid protocol dominates every aspect of life, from daily testing to traveling between venues. The sweeping control requires massive organizational efforts and manpower, but it is also aided by technology - which the organizers have made a point of showing off. At the main media center in Beijing, workers in masks, goggles and face shields work alongside robots that make burgers, mix cocktails, sweep the floor and spray clouds of disinfectant; smart surveillance cameras To those new to China's ""zero-Covid"" approach, the meticulous control is both confusingly convoluted and alarmingly restrictive. Often, Covid prevention makes simple tasks unnecessarily difficult. Walking is rarely an option to get around the ""closed loop,"" even if the destination is just a few blocks away. Instead, participants must take dedicated vehicles. On ""closed loop"" buses, drivers are sealed-off behind a thick transparent screen intended to protect against the spread of the virus - unfortunately, it's also mostly soundproof. Passengers unsure about where to disembark are forced to shout through the screen, or rely on hand gestures. ""In terms of public health measures, this is the most ambitious, most stringent Olympics in history,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a public health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. Throughout the pandemic, the Communist Party has staked its political legitimacy on its ability to contain the virus better than other countries, specifically Western democracies, and as such, is unwilling to take any chances. But Chinese authorities have a fine balance to tread. While overtly stringent measures risk causing unnecessary disruption to the Games, the last thing Beijing wants to see is an outbreak running rampant inside the bubble - or worse, spilling into the capital and beyond. Political controversy The Winter Games' official motto - featured ubiquitously on billboards and banners across the city - is ""Together for a Shared Future."" But in the lead-up to it, the event has only served to spotlight the growing chasm between China and the West. The controversy has been building for months. Rights groups called for a boycott of the Games in protest of China's human rights record, from its treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang - which Washington has labeled a genocide - and its crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong. Beijing's silencing of Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star and three-time Olympian, after she accused a former top party leader of sexual assault has further amplified such calls. In December, the United States announced a diplomatic boycott of the Games, followed by allies including Britain, Australia and Canada. Last week, a coalition of more than 200 organizations called for more nations to join the diplomatic boycott. China has shrugged off the criticism and lashed out at the West for politicizing the Olympics. But that hasn't stopped it from using the event to convey its own political message. As the torch relay got underway in the run-up to Games, state media reported a Chinese soldier who was involved in a deadly border clash with Indian troops was among the chosen few to carry the Olympic flame. The move sparked immediate outrage in India. On Thursday night, the eve of the Games' officially opening, New Delhi said it would join the US-led diplomatic boycotts. ""It is indeed regrettable that the Chinese side has chosen to politicize an event like the Olympics,"" Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Arindam Bagchi said in a televised speech, as he announced the withdrawal of India's top diplomat from the opening and closing ceremonies. What a difference 14 years make As the curtain finally raised on Friday, it became apparent the opening ceremony for the 2022 Games was to be markedly different from that of 2008. Under the cloud of Covid and the international backlash, it was a much more muted affair - with around 3,000 participants as opposed to 15,000 - and far shorter in duration. It also featured a very different guest list. Of the just over 20 presidents, prime ministers, heads of state and royalty attending the event, around half hailed from authoritarian countries. Notably absent were leaders of major democratic powers. That is a far cry from 2008, when then-US President George W. Bush attended the opening ceremony and was seen throughout the Games cheering for Team USA. His father, former President George H.W.

""China is different now, the world is different,"" said Xu Guoqi, a historian at the University of Hong Kong and author of ""Olympic Dreams: China and Sports, 1895-2008."" Whereas the 2008 Beijing Olympics was seen as China's coming-out party on the world stage, ""now, Beijing is claiming 'we are here, we are strong, we are powerful enough, you have to treat us with respect and accommodate the new China,'"" Xu said. In the intervening years between the two Olympics, China has established itself as a rising superpower. Its economy has expanded by three times, ranking second only to the US. Its military might and technological prowess have risen fast and far, as has its global influence. The sense of pride is palpable among the Chinese volunteers working inside the Olympic bubble. Mostly fresh-faced university students, they were born only a few years before the 2008 Olympics, and have grown up witnessing their country's growing prosperity and strength. Several volunteers told CNN this was the first time they had spent the Lunar New Year holiday away from their family. Like the foreign visitors, Chinese volunteers and staff are not allowed to leave the ""closed loop"" until the Games have ended - and not before they have completed three weeks of hotel quarantine. Still, many consider it worthwhile, even for those whose sole duty involves standing in sub-zero temperatures at a bus stop near the ski slopes in the mountains, helping participants navigate a dauntingly confusing transport system. For others, it's a tougher sacrifice. On the Lunar New Year's Day on Tuesday, a mother stood outside the main press center in Beijing, waving to her two young sons behind layers of barricades and fences. ""Mom I miss you. Happy Lunar New Year!"" the younger son shouted as he waved back on the other side, meters away. It was the longest time she had been apart from her family, she said. Working for the Beijing organizing committee inside the bubble, she is not allowed to go home at the end of her work day. Instead, she lives in a designated hotel close enough to see her home. ""It's really hard for me because as a mom I never ... from the birth of them we have been separated for so long,"" she said. ""But it's worth it ... I feel very proud."" She remarked on how different things seemed in 2008. ""(At) that time, everybody felt very excited, and (it was) just a big party,"" she said. ""But this time because of Covid-19 everything is very tough.""",An Olympics like no other: Can sports overcome the controversy of Beijing 2022?

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/10/middleeast/xi-china-saudi-arabia-visit-five-takeaways-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN Years of progressing ties between oil-wealthy Saudi Arabia and China, an economic giant in the east, Xi, who The trip was widely viewed as The United States, which has for more than eight decades prized its strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia, today finds its old partner in search of new friends - particularly with China, which the US worries is expanding its sphere of influence around the world. While Saudi Arabia was keen to reject notions of polarization or ""taking sides,"" it also showed that with China it can develop deep partnerships without the criticism or ""interference"" for which it has long resented its Western counterparts. Here are five key takeaways from Xi's visit to Saudi Arabia. 1) Saudi Arabia and China are aligned on most policy During Xi's visit, Saudi Arabia and China released a nearly 4,000-word joint statement outlining their ""There is very much an alignment on key issues,"" Saudi author and analyst Ali Shihabi told CNN. ""Remember this relationship has been building up dramatically over the last six years so this visit was simply a culmination of that journey."" The two countries also agreed to cooperate on peaceful uses of nuclear energy, to work together on developing modern technologies such as artificial intelligence and innovate the energy sector. ""I think what they are doing is saying that on most issues that they consider relevant, or important to themselves domestically and regionally, they see each other as really, really close important partners,"" said Jonathan Fulton, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""Do they align on every issue? Probably not, but [they are] as close as anybody could be,"" he said. 2) They have big plans for security and oil An unwritten agreement between Saudi Arabia and the US has traditionally been an understanding that the kingdom provides oil, whereas the US provides military security and backs the kingdom in its fight against regional foes, namely Iran and its armed proxies. The kingdom has recently been keen to During a summit between China and countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Riyadh, Xi said China wants to build on current GCC-China energy cooperation. The Chinese leader said the republic will continue to ""import crude oil in a consistent manner and in large quantities from the GCC, as well as increase its natural gas imports"" from the region. China is the And on Friday, the Saudi national oil giant Aramco and Shandong Energy Group said they are exploring collaboration on integrated refining and petrochemical opportunities in China, reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA). The statements come amid global shortages of energy, as well as repeated pleas by the West for The kingdom this year already made one of its largest investments in China with Aramco's $10 billion investment into a refinery and petrochemical complex in China's northeast. China is also keen to cooperate with Saudi Arabia on security and defense, an important field once reserved for the kingdom's American ally. Disturbed by what they see as growing threats from Iran and waning US security presence in the region, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors have recently looked eastward when purchasing arms. 3) Non-interference in domestic affairs is a shared and sacred principle One of the most sacred concepts cherished by China is the principle of ""non-interference in mutual affairs,"" which since the 1950s has been one of the republic's key ideals. What began as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between China, India and Myanmar in 1954 was later adopted by a number of countries that did not wish to choose between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Today, Saudi Arabia is keen to adopt the concept into its political rhetoric as it walks a tightrope between its traditional Western allies, the eastern bloc and Russia. Not interfering in one another's internal affairs presumably means not commenting on domestic policy or criticizing human rights records. One of the key hurdles complicating Saudi Arabia's relationship with the US and other Western powers was the repeated criticism over domestic and foreign policy. This was most notable over the China has had similar resentments toward the West amid international concerns over Taiwan, a democratically governed island of 24 million people that Beijing claims as its territory, as well as human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in China's western The agreed principle of non-interference, says Shihabi, also means that, when needed, internal affairs ""can be discussed privately but not postured upon publicly like Western politicians have a habit of doing for domestic political purposes."" 4) They are not abandoning the petrodollar, just yet During his visit, Xi urged his GCC counterparts to ""make full use of the Shanghai Petrol and Gas Exchange as a platform to conduct oil and gas sales using Chinese currency."" The move would bring China closer to its goal of internationally strengthening its currency, and would greatly weaken the US dollar and potentially impact the American economy. While many awaited decisions on the Analysts see the decision as a logical development in China and Saudi Arabia's energy relationship, but say it will probably take more time. ""That [abandonment of the petrodollar] is ultimately inevitable since China as the Kingdom's largest customer has considerable leverage,"" said Shihabi, ""Although I do not expect it to happen in the near future."" 5) Washington is not happy The US has been fairly quiet in its response to Xi's visit. While comments were minimal, some speculate that there is heightened anxiety behind closed doors. John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator at the US National Security Council, at the onset of the visit said it was ""not a surprise"" that Xi is traveling around the world and to the Middle East, and that the US is ""mindful of the influence that China is trying to grow around the world."" ""This visit may not substantively expand China's influence but signal the continuing decline of American influence in the region,"" Shaojin Chai, an assistant professor at the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, told CNN. Saudi Arabia was, however, keen to reject notions of polarization, deeming it unhelpful. Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud stressed that the kingdom is ""focused on cooperation with all parties."" ""Competition is a good thing,"" he added, ""And I think we are in a competitive marketplace."" Part of that drive for competitiveness, he said, comes with ""cooperation with as many parties as possible."" The kingdom feels it is important that it is fully engaged with its traditional partner, the US, as well as other rising economies like China, added the foreign minister. ""The Americans are probably aware that their messaging has been very ineffective on this issue,"" said Fulton, normally ""lecturing"" partners about working with China ""rather than putting together a coherent strategy working with its allies and partners."" ""There seems to be a big disconnect between how a lot of countries see China and how the US does. And to Washington's credit, I think they are starting to realize that.""",5 key takeaways from Xi's trip to Saudi Arabia
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/14/politics/biden-budget-congress-climate-action/index.html,"CNN After decades of inaction from the United States on climate, President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats face a reckoning. Biden has big climate ambitions, Jonathan Pershing, one of Kerry's senior advisers, recently told lawmakers the US needs to ""walk the talk"" to regain its climate credibility on the world stage. What's not clear is whether the President has the votes in Congress -- even within his own party -- to get it done. As the drought and extreme weather intensify, Democrats view the massive budget bill and its significant climate provisions as their last, best hope to achieve something meaningful on climate as the crisis worsens. In August, global scientists reported the planet is Within the US, pressure is mounting after a series of climate disasters this summer, including ""Scientists have been warning us for years that extreme weather is gonna get more extreme. We're living it in real time now,"" Biden said Monday Touting the budget and infrastructure bills, the President urged people to ""think big."" ""Thinking small is a prescription for disaster,"" Biden said. ""We're gonna get this done, this nation's gonna come together and we are going to beat this climate change."" Congressional leaders have set an end-of-September deadline in the House to pass their massive budget bill alongside a separate bipartisan infrastructure bill. Together, the packages contain hundreds of billions of new climate investments, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer argued will get the US most of the way to hitting Biden's fossil-fuel emissions target of 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. With a razor-thin majority in both the House and Senate, this is Democrats' only shot at passing a substantial climate bill before world leaders meet in November. But there's at least one prominent Senate Democrat who could thwart those plans. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Senate Democrats' key swing vote, wants to pare down the overall size of the bill, and he has said he has Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told CNN negotiations with Manchin are ongoing -- but he was optimistic the West Virginia senator would understand the gravity of a fast-warming climate and its impacts. ""At the end of the day, we're all answerable to the future to get the job done right,"" Whitehouse said. ""I don't think [Manchin] wants to be on the wrong side of that future."" How the bill would tackle the climate crisis After years of inaction in the White House and Congress, Biden's budget bill represents decades worth of policy in a single bill. Experts told CNN it represents a paradigm shift in how to tackle climate change -- moving the entire economy away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy. ""Moving the US economy is equivalent of changing the direction of an enormous ocean liner,"" Josh Freed, founder of the Climate and Energy Program at the center-left think tank Third Way, told CNN. ""It takes time to do but once you have it going in the right direction it can pick up steam and get going quickly."" After re-entering the US into the Paris Climate Accord in January, Biden announced a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. That target could be met in part through federal regulations restricting emissions from vehicles and power plants. A White House spokesperson told CNN the Biden administration sees its climate actions coming both from Congress and executive action. ""We also believe that there exists a number of paths to meeting our emission goals and targets,"" the spokesperson said. ""The Biden climate agenda doesn't hinge on reconciliation or the infrastructure package alone. Rather, it is integrated throughout both -- and it is a key part of everything we do in the whole of government effort launched on day one."" But experts told CNN that Biden needs Congress to pass massive investments in renewable energy, electric vehicles and other green programs to truly make a dent in US carbon emissions. A clean electricity program is Democrats' cornerstone climate initiative in the massive budget bill. It would promote a transition away from fossil fuels by paying electric utilities who increase the amount of renewables and other forms of clean power and penalizing those who don't meet clean targets. Generating electricity from non-fossil fuel sources like wind, solar and nuclear is a critical to Democrats' climate strategy. ""I see the [clean electricity program] as the lynchpin or the foundation piece for this bold action on climate,"" Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, who is a lead proponent of the provision, told CNN. The bill also contains measures to create a job-generating Civilian Climate Corps; tax credits and grants for clean energy, renewables and electric vehicles; new polluter fees for methane and carbon; and consumer rebates to electrify and weatherize homes. What is yet to be finalized is how much funding each program gets. Schumer's office recently put out an analysis showing the bipartisan infrastructure bill and $3.5 trillion budget bill combined could meet the majority of Biden's target to slash emissions by the end of the decade -- putting the US on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. ""When you add administrative actions being planned by the Biden Administration and many states -- like New York, California, and Hawaii -- we will hit our 50% target by 2030,"" Schumer wrote in a letter accompanying the analysis. An uncertain future Democratic leaders have promised a two-track strategy of advancing the budget and bipartisan infrastructure bill together. They want to pass both in the House by the end of September, which will be a monumental task, as moderate and progressive Democrats have already started jockeying over the price tag. While moderates want to see a smaller bill, House progressives want to go bigger and add more money added for climate, and they plan to withhold their votes for the bipartisan infrastructure bill to do it. ""I don't know if $3.5 trillion as a top line is going to be enough to deal with the scale of the crisis,"" Rep. Jamal Bowman of New York recently told CNN. ""I'm considering withholding my vote for reconciliation if it is not big enough and if it doesn't meet the scale of the problem."" With moderates and liberals squaring off, Democratic leaders Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford few Democratic defections in the House, and none in the Senate. ""The stakes are high, the task is enormous, the congressional majorities are quite literally as thin as they could be,"" said Sam Ricketts, co-founder of the climate policy group Evergreen and a former top climate staffer for Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. ""The Biden administration's climate commitments are going to live or die with the success of robust investments through legislative action.""",Biden's spending bill could be Democrats' last hope of achieving meaningful climate action as crisis worsens

Videos posted to social media appeared to show Rekabi being greeted by crowds chanting Her return to Iran comes amid nationwide protests in the country calling for greater freedoms for women, following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in police custody after her arrest for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Consequently, some protesters see her as a symbol of the cause and rights groups have expressed fears for what will happen to her now she is back in Iran. A news website critical of the Iranian regime, IranWire, had claimed that Rekabi would be transferred to prison upon her arrival back in the country. Rekabi herself has suggested - both on her Instagram account and in interviews with state media IRNA - that she had only ""accidentally"" competed without her hijab, which Iran mandates must be worn by women representing the country abroad. However, it is unclear whether Rekabi's comments were made under duress. Her latest comments on Instagram came as the head of the Iranian federation of mountaineering and sport climbing reportedly denied that Rekabi was under house arrest.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/27/world/nato-explainer-intl-cmd/index.html,"CNN As tensions rise between Russia and Ukraine, the role that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plays in the region has come into focus. NATO is a European and North American defense alliance set up to promote peace and stability and to safeguard the security of its members. It was created as the Cold War escalated and is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The aim of the United States-led alliance was to protect Western European countries from the threat posed by the Soviet Union and to counter the spread of Communism after World War II. Here's what you need to know. Which countries are in NATO? Twelve founding countries - the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and eight other European nations - signed the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949, pledging to protect each other by political and military means. Over the decades since, the alliance has grown to include a total of 30 members. In alphabetical order, they are: Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the US. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but has long hoped to join the alliance. This is a sore point for Russia, which sees NATO as a threat and vehemently opposes the move. Amid recent tensions with the West, Russia has asked for But the US and NATO have resisted those demands. The alliance has always had an ""open door policy,"" which states that any European country ready and willing to undertake the commitments and obligations of membership is welcome to apply for membership. Any decisions on enlargement of the alliance must be agreed unanimously. Following the end of the Cold War, NATO made it clear it would welcome expansion to the east and in 1997, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were invited to begin accession talks. Since then, more than a dozen countries from the former Eastern bloc, including three former Soviet republics, joined the alliance. Despite the major geopolitical changes since NATO's foundation, its stated purpose remains the same. The key principle underpinning the alliance is one of collective defense: ""An armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" What does that mean in practice? The principle of collective defense is laid out in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. It guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation. This is crucial for many of the smaller countries who would be defenseless without its allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army. Since the US is the largest and most powerful NATO member, any state in the alliance is effectively under US protection. In reality, the first and only time Article 5 has been invoked was in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US; as a result, NATO allies joined the invasion of Afghanistan. However, NATO has taken action on other occasions too. It put collective defense measures in place in 1991 when it deployed Patriot missiles during the Gulf War, in 2003 during the crisis in Iraq, and in 2012 in response to the situation in Syria, also with Patriot missiles. All three were based on requests from Turkey. Does it have its own army? No. NATO relies on its member countries contributing forces, meaning it is essentially as strong as the individual forces of each nation. It is in the interest of the entire coalition to make sure each country is putting enough resources into its defense. This has been one of the main sticking points in the alliance, with the US and the UK often criticizing other member states for not putting in their fair share. American military spending has always eclipsed other allies' budgets since NATO's founding in 1949. But the gap grew much wider when the US beefed up its spending after the 9/11 attacks. Under the NATO guidelines, each country should be spending 2% of its GDP on defense, but most countries are not reaching that target. Former US President Donald Trump was particularly vocal on this topic, demanding European countries do more and at one point even suggesting they ""repay"" the US for their past shortfalls. According to the most recent estimates from NATO, seven member states, Greece, the US, Croatia, the UK, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Romania and France hit the 2% goal in 2021. Still, this is a significant improvement. In 2014, only the US, the UK and Greece were spending more than 2%. At that time, all member countries that were below the threshold, committed to ramp up military spending to reach the target within a decade. Most are sticking with the promise. How has the organization's remit changed over time? After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO evolved and expanded. Over the years since, its members have served as peacekeepers in Bosnia, fought against human trafficking, and been deployed to intercept refugees in the Mediterranean. The alliance is also responding to the new ways conflicts can unfold, for example by setting up a cyber defense hub in Estonia and, in 2019, recognizing space as a new operational domain. What's it doing about the Ukraine crisis? As Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border in recent weeks, NATO has sought to boost its presence in eastern member states. According to NATO, there are four multinational battalion-size battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, on a rotational basis. These battle groups are led by the UK, Canada, Germany and the US. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is prepared to rapidly reinforce that presence further by sending additional forces and capabilities into the area. The Biden administration has put as many as 8,500 US troops on heightened alert for a possible deployment to eastern Europe. More immediately, several NATO countries have started sending weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. The US has sent two shipments of weapons to Ukraine, including 300 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 800 bunker-busting bombs and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The UK has supplied Ukraine with new light anti-tank weapons, and the Czech government agreed on Wednesday to donate more than 4,000 152-millimeter caliber artillery shells. NATO does not have any troops in Ukraine, and no plans have been announced to send troops from the alliance into the country. But although Ukraine is not a NATO member, the alliance also provides strategic-level advice to the country and has described the relationship as ""one of the most substantial of NATO's partnerships."" Since Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, the alliance has launched a number of projects to support Ukraine's capacity-building in key areas, including cyber defense, logistics and the modernization of the nation's command and control. Since then it has also implemented what it said was the biggest increase in collective defense since the end of the Cold War, ramping up its presence in member states closest to Russia. Why is Germany being criticized? Berlin has come under criticism recently for its policy of not exporting weapons to crisis areas. Germany has so far refused to send arms to Ukraine, promising instead to give Kyiv a field hospital, medical training and 5,000 military helmets. Germany's complicated history means its governments have always been cautious about military spending and the idea of getting directly involved in a conflict is a difficult one to sell there. It has also been criticized for failing to reach the 2% GDP spending target, along with other countries. As Europe's largest economy, Germany is already NATO's third biggest net spender on defense. In 2021, it invested an estimated $64 billion into defense, trailing only behind the UK, which spent $72 billion, and the US which poured $811 billion into its defense - more than twice the total amount spent by all other NATO members. The new German government has committed to increasing spending further to reach NATO's 2% goal, but it has stood firm on the issue of weapons exports. ""The German government has very clearly agreed that we will not send any lethal weapons, or arms deliveries to conflict areas because we do not want to fuel these conflicts further,"" German Defense Secretary Christine Lambrecht said Thursday. Germany hosts more than 30,000 US military forces and their families. It is also one of several NATO countries to host US nuclear weapons on its soil. The UK came to Germany's defense on the issue on Thursday, with British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace saying his country doesn't judge Germany for its decision. ""The advantage of being in NATO is there are 30 allies, so we can all assist Ukraine in our own way,"" he said. ""Obviously, the United Kingdom has taken a view that lethal aid of a tactical defensive nature is something that the Ukrainians need, but we're not sitting in judgement over other countries,"" Wallace said.",What is NATO and when does it act?
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/12/world/iceberg-breaks-off-antarctica-glacier-scn-intl/index.html,"CNN A story about a glacier shedding mass at the edge of the world, threatening to raise ocean levels and potentially contribute to untold environmental change. Sound familiar? That's because it probably is. But if you weren't paying attention before, it probably is worth doing so now. An iceberg has broken off Pine Island Glacier (PIG) on the edge of Antarctica, according to And it's a big one. At more than 300 square kilometers (116 square miles), the iceberg was almost as big ""What you are looking at is both terrifying and beautiful,"" Mark Drinkwater, head of the Earth and Mission Sciences Division at the ESA, told CNN. ""It is clear from these images (that the Pine Island Glacier) is responding to climate change dramatically,"" he added. While icebergs calving from glaciers is a natural process, Drinkwater made it clear that the rate of melting and calving being seen in West Antarctica is greater than anything observed in the satellite record. He pointed to an ""imbalance"" in the glacial system, which meant the impacts of warming temperatures, warmer ocean water and declining of snowfall were not allowing the glacier to replenish itself. Pine Island Glacier, along with its neighbor Thwaites Glacier, effectively act as arteries connecting the West Antarctic ice sheet to the ocean. The region holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by 1.2 meters, or 4 feet, according to NASA. Earlier this month, And only a few days later, the glacier, also referred to as PIG, ""spawned piglets,"" ESA said - in a process known as calving - and ""many large"" icebergs were formed. The largest of them was so big, it was even given a name: B-49. Drinkwater suggested this was due to the continuing instability of the ice shelf, with greater levels of warm water under the glacier causing even greater disruption at the base of it. This phenomenon of calving isn't new for Pine Island Glacier, according to the ESA. Two large rifts in PIG were spotted in 2019 and scientists have kept a close eye on the cracks and changes. But it has been losing ice over the past 25 years. ""Since the early 1990s, the Pine Island Glacier's ice velocity has increased dramatically to values which exceed 10 meters (or 30 feet) a day,"" the space agency said in a ""Its floating ice front, which has an average thickness of approximately 500 meters, has experienced a series of calving events over the past 30 years, some of which have abruptly changed the shape and position of the ice front,"" the ESA said. The changes to the glacier have been mapped by ESA-built satellites since the 1990s, with calving events occurring multiple times since 1992.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/01/politics/iran-missiles-russia/index.html,"CNN Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and The shipment is being closely monitored because it would be the first instance of Iran sending advanced precision guided missiles to Russia, which could give the Kremlin a substantial boost on the battlefield. The last shipment of weapons from Iran to Russia included about 450 drones, officials said, which the Russians have already used to deadly effect in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said last week that they have shot down more than 300 Iranian drones. This new expected shipment would mark a significant increase in Iranian support to Russia's war effort. While the precise timing of when the shipment will arrive in Russia is unclear, officials believe the weapons will definitely be delivered before the end of the year. Drones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since the summer, when the United States and Kyiv say Moscow acquired drones from Iran. In recent weeks these Iranian drones have been used to target critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine. The Iranian drones are known as a ""loitering munition"" because they are capable of circling for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only striking once an enemy asset is identified. They are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance. The US has also alleged that Iran has sent military personnel to Crimea to assist Russian drone attacks on Ukrainian targets. Sending further Iranian weaponry to Russia is a move that will likely cause relations with the US to further deteriorate. On Monday, the US envoy to Iran Rob Malley said the Biden administration is Earlier this month John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said the presence of Iranian personnel was evidence of Tehran's direct engagement in the conflict. ""We can confirm that Russian military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs, using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv,"" Kirby said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles. Malley spoke out strongly against Iran supplying the drones on Monday. ""We know that those drones have been used to target civilians and civilian infrastructure. And we know that Iran, in the face of all of this evidence, keeps lying and denying that it's happening,"" Malley said. On Monday a senior US defense official said they didn't have any information to provide on the suggestion Iran is preparing to send missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. On Tuesday a Pentagon spokesman said the US has ""concerns"" that Russia may ""seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday. ""We do have concerns that Russia may also seek to acquire additional advanced munition capabilities from Iran, for example surface-to-surface missiles, to use in Ukraine,"" Ryder said. Yuriy Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force Command, said on Tuesday that Ukraine currently has ""no effective defense against these (surface-to-surface) missiles. It is theoretically possible to shoot them down, but it is very difficult to do it with the means we currently have."" The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment about the new expected shipment. Iran has previously denied supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, saying it ""has not and will not"" do so. The Washington Post was first to report Iran's plans to send missiles and additional drones to Russia. The US is ""looking at everything that we can do, not just with sanctions"" in order to disrupt the Iranian weaponry from going to Russia, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said last week. He said that the US is ""trying to break up these networks."" But it is unclear if the US will be able to prohibit further shipments from going ahead, even as concerns mount about Iranians sending even more advanced weaponry to Russia. US officials have also said that they are aware of discussions about additional Iranian weaponry to Russia that has not yet been delivered. Last month the US sanctioned an air transportation provider for its involvement in the shipment of the Iranian drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to Russia. The US is also ready to ""target producers and procurers"" contributing to the UAV program, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence said. The question of longevity and sustainability remains because it is unclear how long Iran can or would continue providing weaponry - including more advanced missiles - to Russia.","Iran is preparing to send additional weapons including ballistic missiles to Russia to use in Ukraine, western officials say"
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/31/europe/lukashenko-belarus-russia-nuclear-weapons-intl/index.html,"CNN Russia could place powerful strategic nuclear weapons in Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last week that Moscow would complete the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by the beginning of July. After days of silence, Lukashenko welcomed the move on Friday, announcing he had intensified talks with Putin about deploying both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons in the country. The mentioning of Lukashenko, who has been asking Putin for nuclear weapons for a while, claimed Belarus needed the weapons because Ukraine's Western allies were planning a coup against him. He baselessly accused Western countries of ""preparing to invade"" Belarus from Poland and ""destroy"" it. ""If necessary, Putin and I will decide and introduce strategic nuclear weapons here. And they must understand this ... We will stop at nothing, protecting our countries, our states and their peoples,"" the Belarusian leader was quoted as saying by state media BELGA. The two leaders are scheduled to meet next week. Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told CNN on Monday that Russia's decision to station tactical nuclear weapons in its neighbor ""aims to subjugate Belarus."" ""We are not a nuclear country and we don't want to deploy nuclear weapons in our state,"" she said, adding that the decision violates Belarus' constitution. Belarus is one of Russia's few allies in its war on Ukraine. While the country's military isn't directly involved in the fighting, Belarus helped Russia launch its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, allowing the Kremlin's troops to enter the country from its territory. Putin said last week that Moscow has already transferred an Iskander short-range missile system to Belarus. The device can be fitted with nuclear or conventional warheads. However, the Russian leader said he would not transfer control of the tactical nuclear weapons to Lukashenko, likening the move to Washington's practice of stationing nuclear weapons in Europe to keep host countries, like Germany, from breaking their commitments as non-nuclear powers. ""Our converted planes can also carry a nuclear warhead. You heard from the president of Russia about joint plans to create the appropriate infrastructure on the territory of Belarus. I just want to clarify: The entire infrastructure has been created and is ready,"" Lukashenko said. Lukashenko said that Minsk and Moscow would make ""every effort and use the means to ensure their sovereignty and independence."" He specifically accused Poland and its ""zealous"" Western neighbors of building up the ""formation of certain regiments, banners, legions"" for a ""subsequent coup in Belarus."" Speaking to the nation on state TV, Lukashenko also called for the freezing of ""hostilities"" in Ukraine. ""It is necessary to stop hostilities and declare a truce that prohibits both sides from moving groups of troops and from transferring weapons, ammunition, manpower, and equipment. All stopped, frozen,"" Lukashenko said. However, both Russia and Ukraine immediately rejected the proposal. Senior Ukrainian Presidential Adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said there cannot be a ceasefire while Russian forces continue to occupy Ukrainian territory. ""Any ceasefire will mean [the Russian Federation's] right to stay in the occupied territories. This is totally inadmissible,"" Podolyak said. The Kremlin also ruled out the proposal on Friday. ""In the context of Ukraine, nothing changes. The special military operation continues because at the moment it is the only way to achieve the goals that our country faces,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a regular call with journalists, referring to the invasion by the Russian propaganda phrase. But while he called for a truce, Lukashenko added a warning to the West that Moscow would be obliged to use the ""full power of its military-industrial complex and the army to prevent the escalation of the conflict - phosphorus ammunition, non-depleted uranium, and enriched uranium - everything must go into action if there is deception and even the slightest movement across the border of Ukraine is noticed.""",Lukashenko says Putin could deploy more powerful Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/03/politics/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-opec/index.html,"CNN Several months after President Joe Biden promised Saudi Arabia Now almost a month into the new session of Congress, lawmakers have yet to hear from administration officials about launching a coordinated review of the US-Saudi relationship, despite repeated statements over the past few months by the White House that congressional input would be key to such an assessment. Officials are ""sidestepping the reassessment"" as there is growing realization that getting the two countries' relationship back on track is beneficial to the US, one administration official told CNN. The lack of follow-through has begun to frustrate some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who are worried that the Saudi leadership, including its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), is poised to walk away after the OPEC+ episode last fall without having paid a price. It has also rankled critics of the Saudi government who say the Biden administration now appears willing to put on hold its promised review of the US-Saudi relationship at least in part for domestic political reasons, including the fact that gas prices have significantly leveled off since the fall. The seeming about-face from Biden is underscoring the reality that - despite serious tensions in the US-Saudi relationship that at times spill out into public view as they did last fall - ultimately, maintaining amicable relations with the kingdom remains heavily in the US' security interests. ""There is only so much patience one can have when you've been asking for a conversation for four months,"" one senior Democratic aide told CNN. ""Frustrated is a good characterization. We are expecting and intending to hold the administration to its word."" A significant reversal The decision to not pursue punitive actions against Saudi Arabia or a reassessment of the US-Saudi relationship marks a significant reversal for Biden, Top administration officials had publicly and bluntly criticized the OPEC+ decision in October to cut back production - which one source said was widely received by the administration as a ""slap in the face"" - as ""misguided"" and a ""mistake."" They even went as far as accusing Riyadh of aiding Russia in its war in Ukraine. The White House also announced a course of action: A wide-ranging review of US-Saudi relations in close consultation with Congress to determine next steps. Officials acknowledge there is little warmth between Biden and MBS, whom he once sought to ice out of his talks with Saudi Arabia's official leader, King Salman. But at 87 years old and in poor health, King Salman has delegated extraordinary power to his son, making it virtually impossible for Biden to conduct relations with anyone else in the kingdom's leadership. US officials have described tense conversations with their Saudi counterparts over the course of the past several months and say ties with the kingdom remain damaged. But a lack of good options to downgrade the relationship without sacrificing national security have led a tactic recognition that no major consequences will arise from the oil production decision. Asked for a status update on the administration's review of US-Saudi relations last week, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the administration is continuing to examine whether the relationship is ""in our best national security interests."" But he also notably added: ""This is about reviewing that bilateral relationship, making sure that it's in our best interest but not rupturing it."" A National Security Council spokesperson echoed those sentiments in an email to CNN, noting that the US has ""multiple interests"" when it comes to its eight-decades-long relationship with Saudi Arabia. ""We're focused on a bilateral relationship with the Saudis that serves the interests of the people of the United States and the president's policy objective for a more stable, integrated, and prosperous Middle East region,"" the spokesperson said. To that end, US officials plan to meet with their Saudi counterparts later this month as part of a working-group meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, according to sources familiar with those plans, with one administration official saying those gatherings are expected to serve as a test of sorts on the state of the bilateral relationship. Gas prices and MBS give Biden a tough political conundrum Biden's decision to visit Jeddah Face-time with the crown prince would further But the president went ahead with the trip anyway, defending it as critical to US security But just months after Biden's controversial visit - which included an eyebrow-raising fist bump with the crown prince - came an unwelcome announcement from OPEC+: A significant cut in oil production that triggered concerns that US gas prices would go up even further. So offended were Biden and his aides that the White House openly accused Riyadh of ""aligning themselves with Russia,"" an accusation that seemed designed to lump the kingdom into rogue states like North Korea and Iran, which have aided Moscow in its war in Ukraine. The following month brought another headline that infuriated some Saudi critics. The Biden administration determined that MBS should be granted immunity in a case brought against him by Khashoggi's fiancee - because bin Salman had recently been made the Saudi prime minister, he qualified for immunity as a foreign head of government, a court filing by Justice Department lawyers said. In the immediate aftermath of the OPEC+ decision, administration officials held initial discussions with congressional representatives about possible avenues for action, including the possibility of rotating the US F-16 fleet out of Saudi Arabia and halting continued US military assistance to the country. Officials also weighed whether to support the so-called NOPEC legislation, which would prevent OPEC from being shielded from US antitrust lawsuits for colluding to fix oil prices. That legislation had gained steam on Capitol Hill among Republicans and some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who had expressed an openness to supporting it. Still, administration officials were wary from the get-go at taking steps that could permanently rupture what all agreed was a critical regional relationship. Biden officials consistently voiced concern at what the effects of certain steps might be, given the US-Saudi relationship is viewed as a pillar of regional stability. Others close to the administration voiced concern that halting US arms sales to Saudi Arabia could push the country closer to Russia, which could negatively affect the ongoing Ukraine war. Now, months after the OPEC+ announcement, gas prices have stabilized and inflationary pressures finally appear to be moderating. The midterm elections are also fully in the rearview mirror for the Biden White House, after Democrats far outperformed expectations and left the president and his advisers feeling vindicated about their political position heading into the second half of his first time. One senior administration official, who confirmed that there are currently ""no discussions"" of note within the administration about imposing consequences on Saudi Arabia as Biden had pledged last fall, said simply on gas prices here at home: ""That's absolutely a factor.""",'There is only so much patience one can have': Biden appears to back off vow to punish Saudi Arabia

Three days later, she was dead. The government has strongly rejected responsibility for Amini's story has pulled Iran's  apparatus of discipline back into the limelight, raising the question of accountability and impunity enjoyed by the country's clerical elite. ""It would be hard to find an average Iranian woman or an average family who does not have a story of interaction with [the morality police and re-education centers],"" said Tara Sepehri Far, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. ""That is how present they are."" The morality police are a law enforcement force with access to power, arms and detention centers, she said. They also have control over the recently introduced ""re-education centers."" The centers act like detention facilities, where women - and sometimes men - are taken into custody for failing to comply with the state's rules on modesty. Inside the facilities, detainees are given classes about Islam and the importance of the hijab (or headscarf), and then  forced to sign a pledge to abide by the state's clothing regulations before they are released. The first of these establishments opened in 2019, said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, adding that ""since their creation, which has no basis in any law, agents of these centers have arbitrarily detained countless women under the pretense of not complying with the state's forced hijab."" ""The women are then treated like criminal[s], booked for their offense, photographed and forced to take a class about how to wear a proper hijab and Islamic morality,"" he added. Iran had been dictating to women how they should dress long before the establishment of the current Islamic Republic. In 1936, the pro-Western ruler Reza Shah banned the wearing of allveils and headscarves in an effort to modernize the country. Many women resisted. Then, the Islamic regime that overthrew the Shah's Pahlavi dynasty made the hjiab compulsory in 1979, but the rule was only written into law in 1983. A task force with all the powers of a law enforcement agency, the morality police are  tasked with ensuring that the rules are followed. A number of But disagreements have emerged on the issue of the A survey by a parliament-linked research center in 2018 showed that there has been a decrease in the number of people who believe that the government should enforce the headscarf. And a 2014 report by the Iranian Students' News Agency showed a 15% rise in those believing that hijab should not be compulsory. There has also been a rhetorical shift among the country's leadership, calling for ""education"" and ""correction"" as opposed to forceful implementation of Islamic values, says the researcher, Sepehri Far. Some say that Iran is slowly nearing a tipping point as the government faces mounting discontent over a crippled economy and skyrocketing inflation caused by Amini's death seems to be uniting Iranians of different mindsets, says Sepehri Far, adding that criticism over the incident is coming not just from regime opponents, but also from citizens with no previous history of dissidence, as well as those who are close to power.   ""This time protesters aren't only calling for justice for Mahsa Amini,"" said Ghaemi. ""They're also calling for women's rights, for their civil and human rights, for a life without a religious dictatorship."" While there is a sense that the regime may feel vulnerable, some question whether the current movement will expand or simply weaken in the face of a state crackdown. ""Not only are these protests brutally cracked down [on] and contained each time, but there is no leadership,"" said Tara Kangarlou, author of ""The Heartbeat of Iran,"" who grew up under the gaze of the morality police. ""Growing up as a teenager, we would make sure we avoid[ed] streets that we knew the morality police vans would be parked [on] during the weekend,"" said Kangarlou.

""At the end of the day we are going to have a deal, and it is going to be good enough on climate or it won't go."" Asked if it was a red line for him, Whitehouse shot back: ""It's pretty red."" ""The urgency of the crisis was made very clear this summer,"" said Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and outspoken advocate for climate change regulations. ""We have to work hard to find a resolution of this issue. But I don't think we should finish the legislation until there is a clean energy standard."" The pressure is mounting as Senate is only in town for a truncated week - while the House doesn't return to session until next week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team have aimed to vote on the House version of the bill as soon as next week. That's in part due to a deal she cut with moderate Democrats who had demanded a vote on On Monday, the House Ways and Means Committee officially rolled out its plans to finance the massive proposal, but many senators were still reviewing the tax hikes, warning that there would have to be further negotiations with the House over the financing mechanisms, before the legislation would be finalized. Plus some moderate Democrats like Sen. Jon Tester of Montana insisted the package's costs be fully offset. ""My constituents in New Hampshire never like any tax increases,"" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the senior Democratic senator from the state. ""I think having a tax system that's fair makes sense."" Behind closed doors on Monday, talks began in person - including with Manchin and top Democrats in the Senate. For the last month as Congress was on recess, key Democratic chairmen in the House and the Senate have been hashing out their disagreements among their committee members - and also holding separate talks with other lawmakers who have voiced concerns over the policy, including Manchin. Now that members are back in person, Democratic leaders hope that the differences can be bridged. ""We have work to do,"" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois. ""Everybody is coming back from the August recess. It's our chance to square off, see one another eyeball-to-eyeball but try to work out our differences. But there are clearly differences."" But how quickly that happens - and whether Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer can get his entire caucus united remains to be seen. Because they are relying on a budget process that cannot be filibustered, Democrats don't need any Republicans to back it. But they have no margin for error in the 50-50 Senate, while Pelosi can only lose three votes in the narrowly divided House. ""Some people are above 3.5 some people are below,"" Schumer said of the total $3.5 trillion price tag for the Democratic-only package. ""We've all got to come together."" Asked if he was committed to staying at that number, Schumer said: ""I gave you my answer."" Some Democrats are reacting cautiously. ""I'm not setting a line in the sand on a number, but I do recognize that's a significant amount of money,"" said Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat facing reelection next year, when asked about the price tag. ""And I'm going to look at the details of what are we going to get for whatever the top line number happens to be and then how are we going to pay for it."" The hard choices ahead will force Democrats to grapple with how much of Biden's ambitious agenda on paid family leave, expanded health care, free Pre-K and community college, will be enacted. But some fear that if the party doesn't quickly fall in line, the task will only become more daunting. ""We need to keep moving,"" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren when asked about Manchin's call for a pause. ""This is hard, but it's not going to get any easier over time.""",Democratic divisions threaten to bog down Biden's economic package
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/clean-electricity-program-jobs-reconciliation-climate/index.html,"CNN The lynchpin climate policy of congressional Democrats' $3.5 trillion A report from independent firm Analysis Group, shared exclusively with CNN, finds that if Congress passes a $150 billion Clean Electricity Payment Program, it would increase the US workforce by 7.7 million new jobs and add nearly $1 trillion to the economy by 2031. The analysis was commissioned by Evergreen Action and the Natural Resources Defense Council, environmental groups that have advocated for stronger renewable energy policies. ""These are new jobs; jobs that otherwise would not exist absent the CEPP,"" Pavel Darling, one of the report's authors, told CNN. A Clean Electricity Payment Program, which lawmakers in Congress are still drafting, would give incentives and payments to electric utilities who increase the amount of renewables and other forms of clean power from sources like nuclear, hydropower, and carbon capture in their electricity portfolio, while penalizing those who fail to adequately increase clean electricity sources. Congress is currently considering an approximately $150 billion program, although that figure could change. ""A lot of times we focus on the powerful impact of this policy of reducing carbon pollution, but this analysis clearly shows the economic benefits to the country,"" Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota, who has been the main CEPP advocate in the Senate, told CNN. Smith added that the jobs will not be concentrated in one state or region. For instance, the report shows a massive potential for solar in the Southeastern US, and onshore wind in the Midwest and West. ""This is not going to be a boon for California, or one place or another. This will be spread broadly throughout the country,"" Smith said. Many of the employment opportunities would be in construction, building infrastructure for wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy to power America's electrical grid, Darling said. Jobs in retail and manufacturing would also increase, ""Spending money and stimulating economic activity has this incremental effect as those monies ripple through the economy,"" Darling told CNN. In addition, because the CEPP is largely an incentives-based program that gives federal money to utilities to transition off fossil fuels, it doesn't force utilities to immediately retire their existing fossil fuel resources - which could result in job losses. ""The CEPP builds out a lot of renewable resources, but it doesn't have as much of a negative impact on existing resources because a lot of those resources remain online,"" Darling said. Joel Jaeger, a research associate at the World Resource Institute's Climate Program who was not involved with the analysis, told CNN the results of the Analysis Group study ""seem quite reasonable."" ""Modeling scenarios are always approximations, but they're definitely in the right order of magnitude based on what I've seen in previous economic analysis,"" Jaeger told CNN in an email. ""The most important thing from this study is that the economic impacts are positive, not negative. If passed, the Clean Electricity Payment Program and clean energy tax credits would be the most impactful piece climate legislation in US history, and this study shows that it will not be a cost to the economy, it'll be a benefit. That's a no brainer."" This isn't the only study showing the potential for job growth in renewable energy. The Analysis Group report comes a day after President Joe Biden's Department of Energy Biden in April announced a target for the US to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. The Biden administration and congressional Democrats believe the vast majority of that goal could be reached with a CEPP, combined with expanding tax credits for renewable energy like wind and solar. A Democrats are focusing on electricity as their silver bullet to decarbonize because it has the potential to be a dominant form of energy in the US economy; it can power ""Clean electricity ends up being a catalyst for an entire clean economy,"" said Leah Stokes, a senior policy advisor at Evergreen and associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ""It turns out we can use clean electricity to clean up our transportation, our buildings and even part of heavy industry."" Another design of a CEPP is that by giving federal payments to utilities, it can theoretically help keep rates low for consumers - particularly while utilities are transitioning away from fossil fuels. ""This is an investment by the federal government for keeping electricity bills low while cleaning up the electricity system,"" Stokes said. ""If we don't have that investment, utilities could be pushing costs up for people."" The Analysis Group study shows the majority of the economic benefits and jobs from a CEPP would likely come in the latter part of the decade as programs ramp up to meet Biden's goal of 80% clean electricity by 2030. For instance, the report projects a CEPP would add $85 billion to the economy from 2022 to 2027, then $823 billion from 2028 to 2031. Similarly, the program would add about 750,000 jobs from 2022 to 2027 and approximately 7 million jobs from 2028 to 2031. The report also assumes that future administrations will stick to Biden's 2030 target. CEPP proponents say if Congress passes the program and the US Department of Energy gets it up and running soon,  utilities will adopt it and factor it into their longterm planning, creating immunity from political changes. ""The only way it could be reversed is through further [Congressional] action down the road,"" Arjun Krishnaswami, the climate policy lead with NRDC's Climate and Clean Energy program, told CNN.","First on CNN: Democrats' clean electricity program would create nearly 8 million jobs by 2031, analysis shows"
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/26/europe/putin-belarus-tactical-nuclear-weapons-analysis-hnk-intl/index.html,"CNN Vladimir Putin says he plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, the neighboring ally from which he staged part of his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. When the Russian president uses the word ""nuclear"" the world pays attention and that appears to be a major reason why he said it. As usual with Putin, the world should read the fine print and check the context. The weapons Putin plans to move to Belarus are not strategic nuclear weapons, those giant intercontinental ballistic missiles that, if fired, could end life on earth. Tactical nuclear weapons are smaller, but powerful, and can be used on the battlefield. Putin has been threatening the possibility of nuclear war for the past year, especially when his military operation in Ukraine is faltering. That could help to explain the context of Putin's announcement. He's a man with a lot of problems right now. Russian forces are bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air, but their ground war is not making much headway. Aside from several new trade agreements with China, Putin didn't get much out of his Then there's the International Criminal Court and the Now, about that fine print. Putin is blaming his decision on the other side, saying he made it in response to the United Kingdom supplying Ukraine with anti-tank ammunition that contains depleted uranium. That, Putin charges, is a dangerous escalation. The UK denies this, explaining that the ammunition is used only for conventional purposes. Putin says Russia already is constructing a storage facility for the tactical nukes that will be ready by July. He gave no specific date on which the tactical weapons would arrive. What's more, he notes, Russia already has 10 aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons, as well as several short-range Iskander missile systems that could carry nuclear weapons. Significantly, the Russian leader said he will not transfer control of the tactical nuclear weapons to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been requesting the weapons for a long time. That strikes two former US diplomats with whom I spoke as strange. Lukashenko, they point out, signed an agreement in 1994 to give up the strategic nuclear weapons that Belarus still had at the end of the Cold War. Why would he decide to do this? One diplomat points out that the weapons would have to be maintained by Russian forces who would be permanently stationed on Belarusian soil, a sign that Lukashenko is even more under Putin's control. The Biden administration appears unperturbed by Putin's announcement. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the US is monitoring the implications of Putin's statement but added: ""We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture, nor any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defense of the NATO alliance."" And yet, moving Russian tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus moves them closer not only to Ukraine but to Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, all NATO allies. That raises the threat level in Europe, something that Putin intended to do.","With plan for tactical nukes in Belarus, Putin is scaring the world to distract from his problems"

Inside prison walls While the Iranian authorities are quick to Women - including, I suspect, Rekabi - are no longer afraid of the prospect of imprisonment. This often happens in totalitarian states when life outside prison still feels like imprisonment, and there is very little left to lose. I would know - I am a former inmate of Evin prison. When I was 19-years-old and still an undergraduate student in London, I traveled to Iran to visit relatives. Soon after, in 2016, I was That political situation was very different then: the world was hopeful that the So while the former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was flying from Tehran to Vienna to feign diplomacy, I was accused of ""seducing my subjects"" in order to conduct espionage for British diplomatic envoys. While in detention, I endured months of solitary confinement, long hours of interrogations and a mock execution. In the process, my identity, foreignness and womanhood were weaponized against me. I was coerced to undertake a virginity test in order to prove my innocence, and yet, it was not good enough. When my interrogators finally agreed to move me out of solitary confinement to the women's public ward, I was strip-searched while on my period. The minute I arrived on the public ward, I was so petrified and overwhelmed that I burst into tears. The female political prisoners, many of whom are well-known public figures in Iran, knew what I had been put through; they had seen many girls like me come through Evin's gates before. In the days that followed, I quickly learned that, for Evin's political prisoners, imprisonment at the hands of the Islamic Republic was a badge of honor. They were not particularly troubled to be behind bars; for them, Evin was where their individual freedoms came to die, but where their ideas continued to live on. Every Thursday evening, some Evin inmates gathered together to recite a Muslim prayer. At the end of the recitation, they would also pray for the prison's Narges Mohammadi, who last year was For many Iranians, Evin is not simply a detention site. Located in one of the most affluent neighborhoods of northern Tehran, Evin occupies a very public space in the everyday lives of many Iranians, reminding them of the presence of a penal institution that is an active enabler in the machinery of repression. Having preceded the Islamic Republic, Evin is a historical symbol How the West should respond My friends in the West, many of whom are well-educated and conscious of Western - particularly US - interference in the Middle East, often hesitate to display support for the protests in fear of inadvertently coming across as orientalist or interventionist.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/house-clean-energy-program-climate/index.html,"CNN Lawmakers in the House released early details of a clean electricity program Thursday, which Democrats say would slash fossil fuel emissions by moving the US electric grid to 80% clean energy, like solar and wind. The clean electricity program is the cornerstone climate policy in Democrats' massive economic package. It would give federal grants to electric utilities and electricity suppliers who increase the amount of clean energy in their portfolio. The program would require those who fail to adequately increase clean electricity sources to pay a fee to the US Department of Energy. Lindsey Walter, deputy director of center-left think tank Third Way's Climate and Energy program, says that at the proposed funding level of $150 billion over the life of the program, it will be possible to reach President Joe Biden's goal of 80% clean electricity by 2030. ""It's still the goal we're aiming for, but that's not a mandate in the policy itself,"" Walter told CNN. Democrats are putting heavy emphasis on decarbonizing electricity to achieve their climate goals because it has the potential to be a dominant form of energy in the US; it can power zero-emissions vehicles and provide energy to buildings in addition to powering appliances and lights. ""Clean electricity ends up being a catalyst for an entire clean economy,"" Leah Stokes, a senior policy advisor at Evergreen and associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara told CNN recently. ""It turns out we can use clean electricity to clean up our transportation, our buildings and even part of heavy industry."" The clean electricity program and How would the clean electricity program work? The program would run on a set of incentives and fees for electricity suppliers, like utility companies. Most electricity in the US is currently powered by fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, according to the US Energy Information Administration. As written, the clean electricity program would work to change that by giving utilities incentives to gradually shift away from fossil fuels and incorporate more sources of renewables and clean energy into their electricity portfolio. A fact sheet from the House Energy and Commerce Committee says that utilities will be eligible for a federal grant if they increase the amount of clean electricity supplied to customers by 4% compared to the previous year. The grant would be $150 for each megawatt-hour of clean electricity above 1.5% of the previous year's clean electricity. If, on the other hand, a utility doesn't increase its clean electricity percentage by 4 percent compared with the previous year, it would have to pay a fee to the Department of Energy. How would this change where our electricity comes from? The program defines eligible clean electricity as not creating more than 0.10 metric tons of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. Electricity generation from coal, on the other hand, releases around 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, New sources of energy could include nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and wind, or sources that capture the emissions from fossil fuels before they escape into the atmosphere. The carbon capture element in particular could be key to securing the vote of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin represents a state where coal is still in use, and is a big proponent of carbon capture systems. How many jobs could this program create? Early analysis shows that a clean electricity program could be Many of the employment opportunities would be in construction as new infrastructure is built for wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy to power America's electrical grid. Jobs in retail and manufacturing would also increase, the analysis found. However, those estimates could change as the program will likely change before Congress votes on it. Will the price of electricity increase? The program is designed to keep electricity prices stable, or lower, during the transition to clean electricity. ""This is an investment by the federal government for keeping electricity bills low while cleaning up the electricity system,"" Stokes said. ""If we don't have that investment, utilities could be pushing costs up for people."" What's the future of this measure? Since this program is part of Democrats' massive budget bill, the process of drafting it starts with House committees. Once the committee has marked up, debated and voted on the bill, it will go to the US Senate where that process will repeat. The two chambers will then work on a final bill. This clean electricity payment program will be taken up by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which Manchin chairs. It will likely change before the House and Senate work on a final bill together.",House lawmakers release early details of program that would overhaul electricity sector and slash fossil fuel emissions

The summer 2019 heatwave saw glacier melt rates break records, leading to huge losses in ice volume, reports the Cryospheric Commission (CC) of the Swiss Academy of Sciences. Glaciers around the world are melting due to climate change, and this latest research shows the extent of the problem in Switzerland. Scientists from the CC took measurements from 20 glaciers in the nation and found that about 2% of Switzerland's total glacier volume was lost in the past year, according to a Initial signs for 2019 had been encouraging after glacier snow cover was measured at 20-40% higher than normal in April and May, according to the statement, following a very cold January with lots of precipitation. However the third-hottest summer since records began meant melting accelerated dramatically. Melting was particularly severe in eastern Switzerland and the northern side of the Alps, according to the research, while the southern Gotthard region lost less glacier volume. More than 500 Swiss glaciers have been lost since 1900, and 2019 saw the Pizol glacier removed from the country's glacier monitoring network. Situated in the Glarus Alps, eastern Switzerland, the glacier stands at an altitude of about 2,700 meters. It has lost 80-90% of its volume since 2006 and will be the first to be taken off the network after being monitored since 1893, according to researchers from ETH Zurich university.

Sources familiar with US intelligence have told CNN that Iran The presence of Iranian personnel in occupied Ukrainian territory would mark a significant escalation in Iran's involvement in the war in support of Russia, and a new phase in the two countries' budding military alliance. Reuters on Tuesday also reported that Iran may supply Russia with surface-to-surface missiles.  Nasser Kanani, the spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the allegation, saying Iran ""has always opposed the continuation of the [Ukraine] war."" Despite their differences, If Iran sells missiles to Russia, this would mean that it is ""moving some of its most accurate, some of its most precise ammunition closer to Europe,"" he said. ""It is critical to see Iranian involvement with Russia as part of its larger war with the West."" Since Russia's invasion, the two sanctioned countries have cooperated on political and economic matters, with the military dimension being the latest facet in their relationship. Major General Yahya Safavi, a top military aide to Iran's supreme leader, on Tuesday boasted that 22 countries are now in the market for Iranian drones. Iran, which before the 1979 revolution imported most of its weapons, now manufactures Iran and Russia have repeatedly denied the Islamic Republic's involvement in Ukraine, but analysts have said that the news around Iranian drones isn't necessarily seen as bad publicity in Tehran. While Russia's use of Iranian weapons may  say more about its desperation in the war than Tehran's military prowess, experts say that media reports about ""For the Iranians, it is about getting market share, it is about prestige, it is about solidifying alliances,"" said Eric Lob, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute's Iran program, adding that these are incentives for a country that is as isolated as Iran. Iran hasn't been known as a weapons exporter. Its arms were previously sent to ideologically aligned proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon, largely to fulfill the Islamic Republic's own regional agenda. The Ukraine war, say analysts, is changing that. Drones have been in use in the Middle East for several years, but, Lob said, ""the Iranians have been working on their indigenous drone capabilities since the Iran-Iraq war, since the 1980s,""  giving Tehran ample time for further advancement. The Ukraine war is an opportunity for Iran to observe how its drones are being used in the battlefield, so it can look at the shortcomings and see how to further improve them, said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. She added that ""it is possible that what is happening in Ukraine would bring Iran more customers... Iran really wants to be a big player in the arms and drones industry.""

""So we are watching very closely what is happening in Ukraine."" Tehran and Moscow's growing military ties are, however, ""bad news"" for the West, he said, ""because [we've] never seen such a tight and close cooperation between Russia and Iran.""   Regime change instigated from Washington is not part of the Biden administration's policy on Iran, US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley told CNN's Becky Anderson on Monday.

Sadoun, who has more than 400,000 followers on Twitter, was trending in Egypt, Kuwait and the UAE following the announcement. Kuwait is a country of 4.3 million people, just under 2 million of whom are citizens. The new speaker has not shied away from controversy. In Gulf states, publicly criticizing neighboring countries is taboo but in 2012, after Saudi Arabia proposed joining Gulf nations into a union, Saadoun, as the-then speaker of parliament, said he supported Gulf integration with conditions. ""There cannot be a union with countries whose political systems are different... whose jails are filled with thousands of prisoners of conscience,"" he told the Saudi state-backed news channel Al Arabiya news channel at the time, adding that his own country enjoys freedom of expression and representation. Kuwaiti politics are followed closely in the region.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/25/world/russia-putin-nuclear-weapons-belarus-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Russia Moscow will complete the construction of a special storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by the beginning of July, Putin told state broadcaster Russia 1. He said Moscow had already transferred an Iskander short-range missile system, a device which can be fitted with nuclear or conventional warheads, to Belarus. During the interview, Putin said Russia had helped Belarus convert 10 aircraft to make them capable of carrying tactical nuclear warheads and would start training pilots to fly the re-configured planes early next month. Belarus, which is west of Russia on Ukraine's long northern border, is among Moscow's closest allies. It There have been fears throughout the conflict that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for an offensive, or that Minsk's own troops will join the conflict. Putin's remarks in the interview on Saturday build on comments made in December at a joint news conference with Lukashenko in Minsk, when the Russian leader said Moscow was training Belarusian pilots to fly jets capable of carrying a ""special warhead."" During that conference, and addressing the Russia leader, Lukashenko also said, ""Today we've put the S-400 [air defense] system that you transferred to Belarus into a state of combat-readiness, and, most importantly, the Iskander system, which you have also handed over to us, after promising it half a year ago."" Belarus has had no nuclear weapons on its territory since the early 1990s. Shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it agreed to transfer all Soviet-era weapons of mass destruction stationed there to Russia. Since invading Ukraine more than a year ago, Putin has used escalating rhetoric on a number of occasions, warning of the ""increasing"" threat of nuclear war and suggesting Moscow may abandon its ""no first use"" policy. But for Ukraine, these plans are a sign that Putin is ""afraid of losing."" ""Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, tweeted Sunday. Calling Putin ""predictable,"" Podolyak added that violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, once again shows ""his involvement in the crime."" In his interview Saturday, Putin said Moscow would retain control over any tactical nuclear weapons it stationed in Belarus. He likened the move to Washington's practice of stationing nuclear weapons in Europe to keep host countries, like Germany, from breaking their commitments as non-nuclear powers. ""We are not going to hand over control of nuclear weapons. The US doesn't hand it over to its allies. We're basically doing the same thing (US leaders) have been doing for a decade,"" Putin said. Although there is no guarantee that Putin will follow through with his plan to station the weapons in Belarus, any nuclear signaling by him will cause concern in the West. No indications Russia preparing to use a nuclear weapon The State Department told CNN it would ""continue to monitor the implications"" of Russia's plan to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus but would not adjust its nuclear weapons strategy. ""We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,"" State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement to CNN. Russia and Belarus had discussed this movement of weapons for some time, having made multiple statements throughout the past year, another State Department spokesperson said. Previously, Washington has made clear to Putin there will be consequences to any use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, even low-yield tactical devices, but has deliberately stopped short of spelling out exactly what they would be. Speaking in October, US President Joe Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper, ""It would be irresponsible for me to talk about what we would or wouldn't do,"" in response to nuclear use by Russia.

The reason is that I've always believed that in Georgia, especially as a journalist, one person can make a difference. When Parliament tried to push through a law that would mean I'd have to register as a ""foreign agent,"" for the first time I questioned my decision to raise my family here. My wife is Georgian, and we have two young boys. I'm not alone in thinking this. I find little comfort in the fact that the law was revoked. For the first time in 15 years, I didn't feel welcome in Georgia. But there is another thing too.

The President also made the case for his twin economic proposals, explaining how they would strengthen the nation's resilience to the climate crisis and extreme weather events.

At the age of 16, I was accused of being an anti-revolutionary and sent to Tehran's notorious Evin prison. Even now, decades later, every night when I go to bed, I think of my cellmates. Many are dead, executed by the Islamic Republic of Iran in the 1980s. And those who survived, like me, were tortured in prison. Guards and interrogators, all men, tied us to bare beds in small, windowless rooms that stunk of sweat, urine, and fear, and they lashed the soles of our feet with lengths of cable - heavy, hard, and cruel. It hurt so much that I could not even scream. I was later led to a mock execution, threatened, and raped. I was practically a child and so were many of my cellmates. We had dared protest the fanatical, autocratic laws of the newly formed regime with Ayatollah Khomeini as its supreme leader. I was arrested on January 15, 1982 - more than 40 years ago. Back then, I would never have believed it if someone had told me that in 2022, I would be lying awake at night in my bed in Canada, thinking of innocent young women still being beaten to death in Iran because of being ""immoral."" In the Islamic Republic, beauty remains a mortal sin. When I was languishing in Evin, I kept telling myself that the people of Iran would rescue my cellmates and me. We were Iran's daughters. We had been violated. We had been terribly and viciously wronged. We waited and waited, but no one came. Corpses kept piling up, but no one came. Our parents, friends, and neighbors were terrified. They had heard of the torture and mass executions. The regime had guns, mobs, armies, torturers, and prisons. I suppose good people decided to cut their losses and leave us for dead. Those of us who survived and went home hit a wall of silence. Our loved ones didn't want to talk about it, because it would bring about more trouble. The message was ""move on."" And we tried. God knows, I tried. But what I had experienced and witnessed left my soul in a coma that took me many years to overcome. I was released from Evin in March 1984 when the authorities decided that they had destroyed me, that I was no longer a threat. (In 1991 I left for Canada). Since then, every few years, there have been widespread protests in Iran that have resurrected the hope that the end of the Islamic Republic might be within reach, but, every time, we have been disappointed. Like any other autocracy, the Iranian regime and its Revolutionary Guard are corrupt, and with the extreme inflation that the country has suffered from for many years, lower and middle-class Iranians have more and more difficulty putting food on the table while the governing elite are visibly getting more and more rich. This economic situation together with Iranian women and the youth being beaten and even killed for protesting or simply being ""immoral"" causes more public disillusionment, which leads to more protests. Even though I wish these protests would soon bring an end to the Islamic Republic, I very much doubt they would. Iran is a very divided country on many levels including ethnic and ideological, and these protests do not have a charismatic leader who can unite. Most protestors want the Islamic Republic gone, but what will take its place? Who will lead Iran to a better future and what will this future look like in practical terms? These questions do not have answers yet. I had only just become a teenager when Tehran's streets filled with protesters yelling ""Death to the Shah"" and ""Independence, Freedom, Islamic Republic."" Little did the people know that freedom was inherently incompatible with Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic Republic. History always moves forward, even if very slowly, and not always toward a better future. It would be tremendously difficult for a country that has been under dictatorships for many decades to find its way to sustainable freedom. But miracles do happen in history. The problem is they are usually neither quick nor easy - and they do have a high cost.",Opinion: Dead for showing a few locks of her hair

Kyrsten Sinema - As she met with her members on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who chairs the panel, also talked privately with Manchin to hear his concerns about provisions on free community college and universal pre-K - issues that are also central to President Joe Biden's agenda. Her staff has since been in contact with Manchin's aides, while Murray has been in constant communication with other members as well. Manchin and his staff have been in consistent talks with Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon, a committee where the two powerful Democrats have clashed over several key provisions central to financing the proposal, including on corporate tax hikes, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Wyden has had weekly Zoom meetings with his committee members on individual areas of their proposal, but has made sure to have regular talks with Manchin - either with him directly or through his staff. And Manchin has engaged in long discussions with rank-and-file Democrats as well, including Sen. Michael Bennet over the Colorado Democrat's push to broaden and bolster On education, Manchin is trying to limit the Democrats' efforts to provide universal pre-K and tuition-free community college. He's talked to Democrats about limiting the number of Americans eligible for pre-K by setting income thresholds, while also discussing ways to measure students' performance for community college assuming their tuition is paid for over two years. And on health care, Manchin has suggested substantially reducing funding for home-care services, a key priority of many Democrats. The private discussions come amid Manchin's public call last week ""Sen. Manchin's op-ed made clear that both the present and unknown challenges facing our country far outweigh the politics of passing something of this magnitude at this time,"" a Manchin aide told CNN, referring to the moderate Democrat's concerns over inflation and the ballooning national debt. ""This was true last week, and it is today."" The talks underscore the challenges ahead for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who needs to win over Manchin but also avoid provoking a revolt among progressives - particularly in the House - who are already balking at the West Virginia's private suggestion to bring the price tag of the overall bill down to around $1.5 trillion. And without Senate passage of the reconciliation bill, House progressives are warning they'll derail the Senate's $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan that Manchin was central in negotiating. ""The idea of a $1.5 trillion price tag being sufficient to accomplish those goals for the people is fanciful,"" Rep. Mondaire Jones, a progressive Democrat from New York, said on CNN. What remains to be seen is whether the Senate chairs ultimately cater to Manchin's demands or try to railroad him into making a choice: Approve the most sweeping piece of domestic legislation in decades - or be responsible for sinking it singlehandedly. ""We're moving full steam ahead,"" Schumer Schumer and Manchin - who have long had a frank and collegial relationship - have been in constant talks throughout the month of August and was not caught off-guard by Manchin's op-ed last week, multiple sources say. Schumer knows full well that he needs to keep his most important swing vote at bay, in addition to Sinema, who has already said she'd oppose a bill that costs $3.5 trillion. ""There are some in my caucus who believe $3.5 trillion is too much. There are some in my caucus who believe it's too little,"" Schumer said Wednesday. ""And we're going to work very hard to have unity because without unity, we're not going to get anything."" To get unity, the committee chairs have been working to ensure that Manchin is not caught off guard by provisions in their plan that they hope to unveil next week. Helen Hare, a spokeswoman for Murray, said the Washington state Democrat spoke with Manchin and has had ""regular conversations"" with her committee members since last month. ""She's talking to lots of senators with the goal of getting the strongest possible agreement on free community college, child care and all the other policies she's working to get across the finish line,"" the spokeswoman said. Some issues may be unresolvable - such as climate change. Manchin, who represents a major coal-producing state, has balked at Democratic proposals to impose a clean energy standard to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Democrats have also discussed including a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, something that could lead to industry's use of cleaner-burning fuels. But Manchin has not been amenable to the aggressive climate targets, leaving it unclear where the talks will land. ""If they're eliminating fossils, and I'm finding out there's a lot of language in places they're eliminating fossils, which is very, very disturbing, because if you're sticking your head in the sand, and saying that fossil (fuel) has to be eliminated in America, and they want to get rid of it, and thinking that's going to clean up the global climate, it won't clean it up all,"" Manchin",Manchin lays out long list of demands as key Senate chairs move to win his vote

The deadlines What we know For months, Democrats have been preparing for this moment, building unity over a budget proposal, cobbling together a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan and passing it through the Senate with 19 Republican votes. But, each of those efforts put off what was always going to be the most difficult step in this process: finding a way to get progressives in the House and moderate Democrats in the Senate to agree on These are massive and fundamental questions that Democrats are really just beginning to answer. Yes, many of these items have been a cornerstone of Democratic messaging for decades, but just like Republicans pledge to repeal Obamacare, a campaign slogan is much easier than legislating. The sticking points At the outset, Democrats haven't even agreed on how big this economic package should be. Progressives had argued the bipartisan infrastructure package was meager. Moderates Manchin is just the tip of the iceberg. As CNN's Daniella Diaz's reporting revealed on Sunday, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia has been telling people he'd vote no on the bigger economic bill if he didn't get more of his way on affordable housing. Other moderate Democrats have made clear they have serious concerns about changes that have been floating on changing the estate tax and what is known as ""step up."" That's before you get to real concerns about how much Democrats are actually willing to raise individual and corporate taxes in the face of a lobbying blitz that is just beginning. What to watch So far, Manchin has been the most outspoken about his demands, laying them out on The reality is in a House with a three-vote margin and a Senate where there is no room for error, every single vote matters here. Every single demand has to be listened to and leadership is keenly aware that they are going to have to make some major concessions in the next several weeks to get these items over the finish line. A litmus test The influential House Ways and Means Committee started circulating its list of policies for how to pay for the proposal on Sunday evening where they quickly leaked downtown. For months, Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, has kept those financing plans under wraps in part because he's told me repeatedly, once they come out, they are immediately political ammunition for Republican opponents. But, watch over the next several days at which of those ideas to finance this large Democratic economic package actually survive the onslaught of lobbying.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/stephanie-murphy-budget-bill-democratic-criticism/index.html,"CNN Moderate Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida laid into Democrats on Thursday for rushing their efforts to finish their economic agenda bill by September 15, calling the process ""Incredibly frustrating,"" the latest moderate in Congress to urge Democrats slow down the legislation's progress. It's yet another sign of the precarious weeks ahead as Democrats rush to meet a self-imposed deadline to write their sweeping human infrastructure bill by September 15. After a series of partisan speeches in the House Ways and Means Committee, Murphy called September 15, the day that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have said they want a Democratic agenda bill to be written, an ""artificial"" deadline ""driven by politics not policy."" She also said that, while she supports many of the provisions she's seen so far, without any guidance on how the legislation will be paid for, she cannot assess it or make decisions on how to vote. ""We need more time,"" Murphy said. ""I don't think it is asking too much to want to see this bill in its entirety before voting on any part of it."" Murphy pledged to vote against every section of the bill in committee if she didn't get more of a full view of the bill, but said she'd hoped to work out differences before a final vote on the floor. While Democrats can advance the legislation out of committee without Murphy's support, Schumer and Pelosi cannot afford to lose more votes in either chamber, given their narrow margin of control of Congress. Pelosi can afford to lose only 3 members. And, Schumer can't afford to lose a single one. Murphy is the latest moderate Democrat to express frustration over the process, following Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin At issue Thursday was that the House Ways and Means Committee has not unveiled their full legislation, instead just releasing a fraction of the plan on many items that are far less controversial as they begin their markup today. The committee, for example, did not issue a list of tax increases or ways to pay for the bill yet, even as they are preparing the legislation to be sent to the floor. Those aspects of the bill, which will likely include increases to the corporate tax rate as well as increases on the individual side, are expected to be met with resistance from special interests and Republicans who will seize of them in the midterms. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, has been very cagey for months about how he plans to finance the bill, and past pieces of infrastructure legislation he's floated have always been released without pay fors. The reasoning is that putting out a long list of pay fors is politically risky and it opens the party up to attacks on items that may eventually get pulled out of the bill when it reaches the Senate. But, it's still hard for moderate members like Murphy to make a decision on how to vote without seeing the full rundown of what will ultimately be part of the proposal. Murphy said she would vote no in committee on the legislation in the Ways and Means Committee if she can't get a full picture. The warnings that Murphy is raising right now in committee come after she sent a letter on Friday with her fellow moderate colleague, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, to Democratic leadership raising the stakes on what it would take for them to vote for the final reconciliation bill in general.

""Today it became known that Great Britain, through the mouth of the deputy head of the Ministry of Defense of this country, announced not only the supply of tanks to Ukraine, but also shells with combined uranium,"" Putin said. ""I would like to note that if all this happens, Russia will have to react accordingly. I mean that the collective West is already starting to use weapons with a nuclear component,"" he added. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, depleted uranium is used in ammunition designed to pierce armor plating because it becomes sharper on impact with a target. It is ""considerably less radioactive than natural uranium,"" according to the agency. In response to Putin's remarks, a spokesperson for the MOD said that ""the British Army has used depleted uranium in its armour piercing shells for decades."" ""It is a standard component and has nothing to do with nuclear weapons or capabilities. Russia knows this, but is deliberately trying to disinform,"" they said.

""What this shows is that the ice sheet is not only out of balance but it's increasingly likely to produce more and more extreme loss years."" The report follows Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, is the world's largest island. It's located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of Canada's Arctic Archipelago. Around 79% of its surface is covered in ice. Greenland's ice sheet is the second biggest in the world behind Antarctica's, and its annual ice melt during summer contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea levels every year. But that's set to get worse as increasing greenhouse gas emissions continue to warm the planet. ""We see an Arctic warming about one and a half times faster in summer compared to the global average,"" Sasgen said. In 2019, Greenland's ice sheet lost 15% more ice than the previous record set in 2012, the study found. And while the ice sheet has been increasingly melting since the 1990s, according to the report, several conditions led to the record melt in 2019. Last year was the Sasgen said that these ever-increasing temperatures combined with a low snowfall, and warm atmospheric and cloud-free conditions that allowed more solar radiation to enter the ice sheet, led to the huge melt production seen last year. Interestingly, two colder years that preceded 2019 saw a reduction in the ice melt. Satellite data found that Greenland's ice loss in 2017 and 2018 was lower than in any other two-year period between 2003 and 2019, due to two abnormally cold summers in western Greenland, a snowier fall and winter conditions in the east, according to the report. However, Sasgen said those two cold years don't compensate for the dramatic melting in 2019. The report found that the ice sheet will continue to lose mass in response to Arctic warming. ""This extreme melt kicks off feedbacks that may accelerate the mass loss. This is what is worrying, the extremes are increasing and we understand too little about how the ice sheet will respond to more extreme climate variability,"" Sasgen said. Sea levels are projected to rise by about 1 meter (3 feet) by the end of the century, inundating low-lying coastal areas and wiping away beaches and properties. Without building up defenses, some 300 million people worldwide - including in the United States, Europe and across Asia - From coastal US states such as Reducing CO2 levels, Sasgen said, is the only hope to slow global warming and reduce future extreme ice melt. Like we think of the Romans as the civilization who invented the sewer system, Sasgen said we should consider how our society will be thought of in years to come. ""If you think about our civilization in 2,000 years when the ice sheet has significantly shrunk and the sea level has risen by probably a few meters, our society will be regarded as the one that triggered this decrease in continental ice,"" he said. ""It's not only four years, or 10 years or 100 years, it's a process that will continue for a very long time and we're just seeing the start of it.""","Greenland's ice sheet melted faster than ever before in 2019, study says.

The Wall Street Journal Here are three ways in which China, the world's biggest buyer of commodities and a financial and technological powerhouse, has been propping up 1. Buying its energy Western sanctions against Moscow include These moves were aimed at weakening Russia's ability to finance the war. They've had an impact. Russia's economy slid into But Moscow's fiscal revenues increased, according to the Russian government. That's mainly thanks to high energy prices and Russia's efforts to reroute exports to other willing buyers, such as China and India. ""China has supported Russia's war economically in the sense that it has ramped up trade with Russia, which has weakened Western efforts to cripple Moscow's military machine,"" said Neil Thomas, senior analyst for China and Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group. ""Xi Jinping wants to deepen China's relationship with an increasingly isolated Russia,"" he said, adding that Moscow's ""pariah status"" enables Beijing to exert more leverage on it to obtain cheap energy, advanced military technology and diplomatic support for China's international interests. Total trade between China and Russia hit a new record high in 2022, up 30% to $190 billion, according to Chinese customs figures. In particular, the energy trade has risen markedly since the onset of the war. China bought $50.6 billion It's a boon for both sides. For Russia, it desperately needs new customers as its fossil fuels are shunned by the West. For China, now focused on ""For Russia, this partnership is born of desperation,"" said Keith Krach, former US Under Secretary of State for Economic growth, Energy and the Environment. ""He [Putin] is looking for help wherever he can find it and Xi Jinping is all too willing to prey on Putin's desperation."" ""As for China, its eagerness to boost Russia is the latest in a series of moves that reveal yet again that Beijing is an irresponsible actor,"" Krach told CNN. The two sides are planning to expand that partnership further, including ""With China's economy opening up in 2023, we can expect a further increase in Russian exports to China, including petroleum and other oil refined products,"" said Anna Kireeva, an associate professor at Moscow State Institute of International Relations. 2. Replacing Western suppliers Other than energy, Russia has also been spending billions on buying machinery, electronics, base metals, vehicles, ships and aircraft from China, as detailed in a US Congressional Research Service ""Despite China's reluctance to lend direct support to Russia's war, bilateral ties will continue to grow because Beijing is opportunistic,"" Thomas said. ""Xi values Putin's support as [a] strategic ballast against an increasingly hostile United States, but he is interested in Russia primarily because of what it can do for China,"" he added. Russia also needs to find substitutes for its imports from Western markets, such as ""And here China with its industrial capacity cannot be rivaled by any other major producer,"" Kireeva said. Chinese car brands, including Havel, Chery, and Geely, have seen their market share surge from 10% to 38% in a year following the exit of Western brands, according to the most recent data from Russian research firm In consumer electronics, Chinese brands accounted for about 40% of the smartphone market at the end of 2021. A year later, they've virtually taken over the industry with 95% market share, according to market research firm Counterpoint. 3. Providing an alternative to the US dollar After some Russian banks were cut off from SWIFT, Moscow has been Russian companies have been using more yuan to facilitate the increased trade with China. Russian banks have also conducted more transactions in yuan to protect them from sanction risks, according to Kireeva. The yuan's share of the Russian foreign currency market jumped to 48% by November 2022 from less than 1% in January, according to Russia briefly Russia's financial ministry has also doubled the share of yuan reserves the country's sovereign wealth fund can hold to 60%, after a big chunk of its savings were Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has said that Russia would only buy yuan in 2023 to refill the country's sovereign wealth fund, ""Of all foreign currencies that the Russian [central] bank had its reserves in, it is only Chinese yuan that was not frozen and remains a 'friendly' one,"" said Kireeva. ""We are likely to see further de-dollarization of Russia's foreign trade in general and [an] increasing share of trade in national currencies with all states that are friendly or neutral to Moscow."" With more yuan reserves, Moscow is able to use the Chinese currency to stabilize the ruble and its financial markets. The ruble has plunged by more than 40% against the euro and the dollar in the past year, and the main Russian stock index has fallen by more than a third. Last month, Russia's financial ministry announced it would resume foreign exchange interventions by selling yuan and buying rubles. However, the relationship is not entirely frictionless.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/12/world/3-degrees-sea-level-rise-climate-central/index.html,"CNN The planet is warming rapidly, resulting in A new study from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group, shows that roughly 50 major coastal cities will need to implement ""unprecedented"" adaptation measures to prevent rising seas from swallowing their most populated areas. The analysis, in collaboration with researchers at Princeton University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, resulted in striking visual contrasts between the world as we know it today and our underwater future, if the planet warms to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists But even in the most optimistic scenario, where global greenhouse gas emissions begin to decline today and are slashed to net zero by 2050, global temperature will still peak above the 1.5-degree threshold before falling. In less-optimistic scenarios, where emissions continue to climb beyond 2050, the planet could reach 3 degrees as early as the 2060s or 2070s, and the oceans will continue to rise for decades beyond that before they reach peak levels. ""Today's choices will set our path,"" said Benjamin Strauss, the chief scientist at Climate Central and lead author on the report. Climate Central researchers used global elevation and population data to analyze parts of the world that will be most vulnerable to sea level rise, which tend to be concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. Small island nations at risk of ""near-total loss"" of land, the report says, and eight of the top 10 areas exposed to sea level rise are in Asia, with approximately 600 million people exposed to inundation under a 3-degree warming scenario. According to Climate Central's analysis, China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia are in the top five countries most vulnerable to long-term sea level rise. The researchers note that these are also countries that have added additional coal-burning capacity in recent years. In September, a At the UN General Assembly in September, China made a If the planet hits 3 degrees, Climate Central reports that roughly 43 million people in China will live on land projected to be below high-tide levels by 2100, with 200 million people living in areas at risk of sea level rise over the longer term. With every fraction of a degree of warming, the consequences of climate change worsen. Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, scientists say the kinds of extreme weather the world experienced Beyond 1.5 degrees, the climate system could begin to look unrecognizable. According to the Climate Central report, roughly 385 million people currently live on land that will eventually be inundated by high tide, even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. If warming is limited to 1.5 degrees, sea level rise would affect land inhabited by 510 million people today. If the planet reaches 3 degrees, the high-tide line could encroach above land where more than 800 million people live, the study finds. The authors note in the report that a key caveat in their assessment is the lack of global data on existing coastal defenses such as levees and seawalls to fully project exposure to rising seas. Nonetheless, they recognize that because of the impacts seen today with recent flooding events and storm surges, cities will likely revamp infrastructure to avoid worsening impacts. ""Higher levels of warming will require globally unprecedented defenses or abandonment in scores of major coastal cities worldwide,"" the authors wrote, ""whereas the count could be limited to a relative handful through strong compliance with the Paris Agreement, especially limiting warming to 1.5 degrees."" But coastal infrastructure costs money. Wealthy nations like the United States and the United Kingdom could afford these measures, but low-income nations could be left behind. And while many small island nations are surrounded by mangroves and coral reefs that could protect their lands from rising seas, warming temperatures are causing ocean acidification and other forms of environmental destruction that threaten such defense measures. During the first two weeks of November, world leaders will gather at Unless bold and rapid actions are taken, extreme weather events and climate change-fueled sea level rise will increasingly fill the future of the Earth. Scientists say the planet is running out of time to avoid these worst-case scenarios.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/10/opinions/iran-social-rights-disappear-rapidly-nemat/index.html,"CNN I was 13 years old when the Islamic Revolution toppled the Iranian government in 1979. Though I was a Christian living in a largely Muslim country, I had never felt discrimination because of my faith. My grandmothers had escaped the 1917 Russian Revolution and fled to Iran in search of freedom. And to a certain extent, they had found it. My father had become a successful ballroom dancing instructor in Tehran and taught Muslim couples the cha-cha and the tango. My mother was a hairdresser who styled fashionable Muslim women's hair. And I had grown up wearing bikinis on the shores of the Caspian Sea, while partying with my Muslim friends. The revolutionary leaders promised to expand social freedoms, grant political ones and build a democracy. They used our grievances against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, to win our trust and gain power. But as soon as they assumed office, the few personal liberties we had enjoyed vanished and a strict Islamic law was put in place. In less than a year, women's rights to self-expression were stripped away: The irony was that a few of my Christian relatives had trusted Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic revolutionary leader, and celebrated when the Shah was forced into exile. Now, they, like me, were paying the price. Though Iran's transition from a nation of limited social rights to one of virtually none may seem like a distant reality to those living under democracy, the truth is that it is not. If Western democracies are not on guard, their citizens can fall prey to the same kinds of leaders who now control Iran's political infrastructure. The revolutionary leaders were populists who promised to return power to the people after decades of monarchical rule, and for many disenfranchised voters in democracies who feel their elected officials have ignored their struggles, the populist messaging can have quite a strong appeal - even if it is just a ploy. But the risk is not only in losing civil or democratic rights, but in being punished for challenging the authority figures who have stripped citizens of those rights. After 1979, our accomplished teachers were replaced by fanatical young academics, many of whom were members of the newly formed Iranian Revolutionary Guard. They spent class time spreading the government's propaganda and trying to persuade us that the regime's fanatical rules - like At the time, I told our principal that I was a Christian, so the new Islamic rules of modesty should not apply to me. She responded, ""You believe in the wrong religion."" I was politically naive, but I was also aggrieved, having experienced firsthand why freedom of religion mattered. I attended protest rallies to express my frustration with the new religious laws that limited or attacked the rights of Iranian women. Speaking out against the regime, in any shape or form, was now considered an act of war against God - the penalty for which could be death. And, in January 1982, the Revolutionary Guard arrested me for doing just that. At only 16, I Six months after his death - and two years, two months and 12 days after my initial arrest - I was released. My captors had decided that there was no reason to keep me any longer, perhaps because they had succeeded in destroying my spirit and suppressing my desire to protest. Many of my friends and cellmates had been executed while I was in prison, and I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder - not that I knew it at the time. I was just shy of 19 years of age when I was released. Though it took me several years - and a move to Canada - before I shared the details of my tragic story, I determined to do so because a democracy is only as good as its citizens. Now, living in the West, I have become acutely aware that even the strongest democracies are not immune to demagogues parading as populists. Those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up. Because once the demagogues - or aspiring ones -  have assumed control, it will be too late. Indeed, democracy is like water caught in the palm of our hands. If we do not focus on holding onto it, the water will drip away through our fingers, and we will be left with nothing but a burning thirst. Though Iran was not a democracy before the revolution, any hope of a peaceful transition to one post-revolution has all but faded today. The Islamic Republic of Iran And it certainly does not have a thriving The line that separates democracy from tyranny is not as thick as Westerners might choose to believe.

Over the weekend, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee also began But some of the options have already been met with stiff resistance as corporate interests and DC lobbyists clamor to stop rollbacks of tax breaks they've enjoyed. The other challenge is that some of the Democrats who are most committed to fully paying for their $3.5 trillion package are the same ones with serious concerns about raising taxes too much, with some facing tough reelections back home. Those tensions have frustrated some Democrats who argue that it's up to members who want to pay for the package to be flexible in the ways to do so. ""For senators who are focused on paying for the entire package, the revenue is there. No one can say it's not. Many options have been released publicly and there are multiple paths to hitting our revenue targets,"" one Democratic aide said. Internal and external tensions Democratic lawmakers said internal tensions over how much of the bill should be paid for and how to do it are already creating schisms within the caucus. ""A lot of the members who want to go big on all these benefits want to have it all paid for and simultaneously don't like any of the ways you pay for it,"" one Democratic member said.""This is how being in the majority is different than being in the minority. When you are in the majority and have to figure out how to reconcile that, we have had some of those conversations within the caucus and it's tough."" Already, outside groups have started a lobbying and advertising blitz. The US Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers all oppose the tax proposals, arguing that they will destroy jobs and undermine the economic recovery. ""Business Roundtable is deeply concerned about potential tax increases on U.S. job creators that would counteract the benefits of infrastructure investment,"" Joshua Bolten, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement. The American Farm Bureau Federation and hundreds of other farm organizations have urged lawmakers to leave some tax provisions alone, worried about the effect the proposed changes would have on family-owned farms. Behind the scenes this month, efforts to block several changes to what is known as the ""step-up basis"" have become the latest fight. Former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, has been campaigning against a provision that would change the way appreciated assets are taxed upon death - arguing that it would hurt family farms and family-owned business. Currently, individuals can inherit property without paying taxes until they sell it - allowing farms to be passed from one generation to the next tax-free. Historically, capital gains on property or securities have not been taxed until realized. But critics say this creates a loophole, allowing the wealthy to avoid paying taxes, and closing it could raise billions of dollars in revenue for the US government. The Biden administration has vowed to protect family farmers so that they are exempt from a capital gains tax at death, but Heitkamp is skeptical that those exemptions will stay in place over time. ""Taxing unrealized gains will have economic ramifications, but equally important, political ramifications for Democrats in rural America,"" Heitkamp, who lost reelection in 2018, told CNN. ""It won't be well received,"" she added. Controversial tax provisions That provision is just one of dozens of tax provisions that Democrats will have to work through in their caucus. Increasing the corporate tax rate from 21% has been another area where moderates and progressives have disagreed. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has signaled he doesn't want to go above 25%, but each percentage point is estimated to provide about $100 billion in revenue. Going up higher gives Democrats more money to work with and spend on key social programs they want to expand. Increasing the tax rate on capital gains is another area where Democrats are hitting a wall of opposition. A reworking of the international tax code has been a top target for Wyden for years, but has also spurred backlash from lobbyists. In ""I believe there are some changes made that [do] not keep us competitive,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" ""I want to increase taxes on corporations, I've spoken to corporations, I want the wealthy to pay their fair share."" As a sign of the controversy ahead, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee began their mark up Thursday on the spending portion of their bill, but had held out revealing the tax increases. A draft proposal was circulated over the weekend ahead of an expected officially unveiling on Monday. But one moderate Democrat on the committee, Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, pledged last week to vote against every section of the bill in committee until she saw the full scope of the legislation. ""While I support many provisions in the Build Back Better Act, it's being rushed through my committee before we know exactly what's in it, what it's going to cost, & how we're going to pay for it,"" Murphy wrote in a tweet Thursday, becoming the latest moderate in Congress to urge Democrats slow down the legislation's progress. For Democrats, the weeks ahead will test to what extent their rhetoric can actually become policy. With just a three-vote margin in the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is managing a caucus with disparate views on how bold the tax changes should be. She also has members who have vowed to vote against Biden's economic agenda bill if they don't get a rollback of the cap on the state and local tax deduction, which could cost billions of dollars to do and would need to be offset with additional revenue. Many of the members fighting to include the rollback on the limit hail from states like New York, New Jersey and California where state and local taxes are higher. ""For me, I have one issue SALT,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi, a New York Democrat, told CNN. ""No SALT, no deal. Everything else, how much do we spend? How will we do the programs? I will support whatever we can come up with as a team.""",Democrats face divisions over pledge to scrap Trump's tax cuts

""I welcome President Biden's announcement that the United States of America will significantly increase its international climate finance to approximately US$11.4 billion a year.

""I also welcome the announcement made by President Xi that China will end all financing of coal fired power plants abroad and redirect its support to green and low carbon energy.

We see the warning signs in every continent and region - scorching temperatures, shocking biodiversity loss, polluted air, water and natural spaces."" More than a decade ago, world leaders from developed countries agreed to contribute $100 billion a year to support countries in the Global South that are facing the most direct impacts of climate, a goal that was missed. In 2019, developed countries contributed $79.6 billion for developing countries, around $20 billion short of the $100 billion annual goal, according to a recent The US was also criticized for failing to transfer any money under the Trump administration; Trump pulled the US out of its global climate financing commitments when he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. Even with Biden's new commitment, US allies contribute more to the effort. For instance, the European Union transfers around EUR25 billion a year (the equivalent of $29.3 billion). China has invested heavily in new coal projects abroad in the past. According to the Green Belt and Road Initiative Center, which analyzes the BRI, China had announced or planned $160 billion worth of coal-fired plants globally between 2014 and 2020.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/politics/senate-reconciliation-package/index.html,"CNN Senate Democrats released their sweeping Democratic leaders are hoping to use the budget resolution to push through the massive broadening of the nation's social safety net envisioned in Unlike the The resolution provides recommendations from the Senate Budget Committee to other committees. The bill itself has yet to be written, and the elements of it will likely be modified as it works its way through each committee. Lawmakers have a target date of September 15 to submit their detailed legislation, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.  The Senate Budget Committee, which released a However, a memorandum to Democratic senators sent Monday specifies that new taxes on families making less than $400,000 a year, small businesses and family farms would be prohibited. Here's what's in the Budget Committee's resolution summary: Broader supports for families The resolution calls for multiple measures that were contained in the The budget framework seeks to establish a universal Pre-K program for 3- and 4-year-olds and a new child care benefit for working families. Under the American Families Plan, the federal government would invest $200 billion in universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds through a national partnership with states. The administration estimates it would benefit 5 million children and save the average family $13,000 when fully implemented. It would be accessible to families of all income levels, but states would be required to foot about 50% of the cost when the measure is fully up and running.  The framework also calls for enhancing child care for working families. Under Biden's proposal, low- and middle-income households would pay no more than 7% of their income on child care for kids younger than age 5. Parents earning up to 1.5 times the median income in their state would qualify. The President also wants to invest more in the child care workforce to bring their wages up to $15 an hour, from the typical $12.24 hourly rate they earned in 2020. The blueprint proposes making community college tuition-free for two years. Under Biden's plan, the federal government would cover about 75% of the average tuition cost in each state when the program is fully implemented, with states picking up the rest. States would also be expected to maintain their current contributions to their higher education systems. The resolution calls for increasing the Pell Grant award and making investments in historically Black colleges and universities, as well as other institutions that cater to students of color. The President's plan would provide up to approximately $1,400 in additional assistance to low-income students by increasing the Pell Grant award. The blueprint asks to create the first federal paid and medical leave benefit. The American Families Plan calls for giving workers a total of 12 weeks of guaranteed paid parental, family and personal illness/safe leave by the 10th year of the program. And the budget resolution seeks to extend the expansions of the Families this year can receive a child tax credit totaling $3,600 for each child under 6 and $3,000 for each one under age 18. The tax credit, half of which is being Expanded federal health care programs and assistance The blueprint recommends adding Nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries, or 24 million people, did not have dental coverage, as of 2019, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation report. The resolution also calls for extending the The subsidies reduce the amount Obamacare enrollees have to pay to no more than 8.5% of their income and make assistance available to more Americans. Also, lower-income policyholders can receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums completely. But the boost in aid is only available this year and next.  In addition, the budget blueprint proposes investing in home and community-based services to help seniors, the disabled and home care workers. Biden had included a $400 billion investment in these areas in his original infrastructure proposal, but it did not make the final package. And the resolution calls for creating a new federal health program for Americans who live in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. A dozen states have yet to do so, and the voter-approved expansion effort is Missouri is currently in court. More than 2 million low income adults fall into the coverage gap, according to Kaiser. The instruction also calls for lowering the price of prescription drugs, saying it will save hundreds of billions of dollars. In addition, it calls for promoting health equity, particularly investing in maternal, behavioral and racial justice health measures. Health equity has been one of the priorities of the Biden administration. Combats climate change The resolution seeks to make investments aiming to meet Biden's goals of reducing economy-wide carbon emissions by 50% and for the US power grid to get 80% of its power from emissions-free sources before 2030.  It calls for implementing new polluter fees, creating new consumer rebates for home electrification and weatherization, providing clean energy, manufacturing, and transportation tax incentives and grants and electrifying the federal vehicle fleet and buildings. It would also invest in agriculture conservation, drought and forestry programs to help reduce carbon emissions and prevent wildfires. Invests more in infrastructure and jobs The Democrats want to make even more investments in infrastructure projects that would not be funded by the bipartisan infrastructure package. Biden wanted some of these investments in the infrastructure bill - like improving aging Veterans Administration hospitals, boosting American manufacturing, job training and workforce development programs - but he also wanted bipartisan support and the provisions were cut out during months of negotiations.  The budget resolution would invest in affordable housing, Native American infrastructure, and create what Biden is calling a Civilian Climate Corporations to employ thousands of young people to work conserving public lands and waters, bolstering community resilience and advancing environmental justice. It also calls for providing green cards to millions of immigrant workers and families. ",Here's what's in the Senate version of the Democrats' $3.5 trillion spending plan

""My message to everyone grappling with this devastation is: We're here. We're not going home til this gets done. I really mean that. We're not leaving. We're going to continue to shout as long as it takes to get real progress here, folks,"" Biden said after touring damage caused by the hurricane in Queens, New York. The President continued: ""And we have to take some bold action now to tackle the accelerating effects of climate."" ""Folks, the evidence is clear: Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy, and the threat is here. It's not going to get any better,"" Biden said. ""The question is, can it get worse? We can stop it from getting worse."" The President again pitched his sweeping infrastructure plan, which he argues would better protect the nation from future extreme weather events and cut emissions. ""We've got to listen to the scientists and the economists, and the national security experts: They all tell us this is code red. The nation and the world are in peril,"" the President added. ""That's not hyperbole. That is a fact."" He continued: ""They've been warning us the extreme weather would get more extreme over the decade, and we're living it in real time now. We can look around the wreckage and the ruins and the heartbreak from so many communities to feel it. You don't understand, you can feel it, you can taste it, you can see it."" Biden said he believed the recent extreme weather events across the country, including deadly wildfires in the West, were causing even climate skeptics to see ""that this really does matter."" ""People are beginning to realize this is much, much bigger than anyone was willing to believe,"" Biden said. The President thanked local leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, for their work in mobilizing and coordinating relief efforts. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was working intensely with state and local officials to assess damage and mobilize resources. The President said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra was working with the state of New York to ensure those on Medicare and Medicaid get the emergency care they need. ""They're going to make sure it's equitable so that the hardest hit, including lower-income folks, communities of color and the elderly and the most vulnerable get help and get it first. They are the ones in the greatest need,"" Biden said. Earlier in the day, Biden was in New Jersey to receive a briefing on the hurricane damage and described it as ""profound."" He called this moment an inflection point for doing something about climate change. ""You really took a hit,"" Biden told the local officials of Hurricane Ida, expressing his condolences and thanking first responders for their courage. After Ida made its way through Louisiana and Mississippi, its remnants - a tropical depression - led to heavy rain, flooding and tornadoes along the northeast. In addition to the 13 storm-related deaths in Louisiana, there have been at least 50 storm-related deaths in the Northeast, spanning Connecticut, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Biden has approved disaster declarations for New Jersey and New York. Of the dozens killed in the East, The visit marks the President's second trip in the span of a week to survey damage brought by the storm. On Friday, Biden visited several sites in Louisiana, which included meetings on disaster response and touring neighborhoods ravaged by the hurricane. After it swept out of the Gulf and into the Northeast, the rains from Ida wreaked havoc. Major interstates across the Northeast flooded. Water rushed into a number of New York City subway stations, and more than 800 subway riders had to be evacuated. As of Monday, nearly half a million businesses and homes in Louisiana remained without power, according to PowerOutage.US. Biden also made the case for more climate-resilient infrastructure during his visit to Louisiana, ""Things have changed so drastically in terms of the environment. We've already crossed certain thresholds. We can't build back roads, highways, bridges, anything to what it was before. We gotta build back to what it is now, what's needed now,"" Biden said on Friday. ""And I know the heads of the energy companies understand this really well. We have a significant piece of legislation, both the infrastructure bill and a budget thing, a reconciliation bill, that calls for significant investment in being able to deal with what is about to come."" And ""We haven't experienced this before, but we should expect it the next time, and that means we have to continue investments in infrastructure, working in partnership with our federal government, and support from (New York Democratic) Senator (Chuck) Schumer and President Biden,"" New York Gov.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/18/politics/us-warns-allies-china-russia/index.html,"CNN The US has recently begun seeing ""disturbing"" trendlines in China's support for Russia's military and there are signs that Beijing wants to ""creep up to the line"" of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught, US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN. The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China's posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference over the last several days. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the issue ""The Secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,"" a senior State Department official told reporters. Vice President Kamala Harris also alluded to China's support for Russia ""We are also troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with Moscow since the war began,"" Harris said Saturday. ""Looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing, and further undermine a rules-based order."" Officials said the US is seeing China publicly trying to present itself as a proponent of peace - Wang said in Munich on Saturday that Beijing would be introducing a ""peace plan"" for Ukraine and Russia - and maintain relationships with Europe, while at the same time quietly aiding ""This warfare cannot continue to rage on. We need to think about what efforts we can make to bring this warfare to an end,"" Wang said at the conference. CNN asked European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday whether she believed, after hearing Wang's speech, that China is listening to Europe's message to not support Russia. ""The opposite,"" she said, has been seen so far. ""We've seen that China and Russia signed an unlimited partnership, and I think we need more proof and more action to see that China is not supporting Russia,"" she told CNN. ""So far, we see the opposite. And therefore, there is an open question on the table."" In a clip of an interview with CBS' ""Face the Nation"" released on Saturday, Blinken said the US has been monitoring possible increased support for Russia from China ""very closely"" and has ""made very clear"" to Beijing the consequences of providing weapons or ammunition to the Kremlin. ""To date, we have seen Chinese companies - and, of course, in China there is really no distinction between private companies and the state - we have seen them provide non-lethal support to ... Russia for use in the Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""The concern that we have now is based on information we have that they're considering providing lethal support. And we've made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,"" he added. As That equipment has included items like flak jackets and helmets, multiple sources familiar with US and European intelligence told CNN. But China has stopped short of the more robust military assistance, like lethal weapons systems for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, that Russia has requested because it has not wanted to be seen as a pariah on the world stage, officials said. But there are signs now that Beijing could now be considering it, the officials said, and Biden administration officials are warning publicly and privately that the US is monitoring closely for any violations of western sanctions prohibiting military support for Russia.

In a statement released Sunday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to use the extra spending, spread over two years, to replenish ammunition stocks, modernize the UK's nuclear submarine program and fund the ""next phase"" of AUKUS, a security pact struck between the three nations in 2021. Details of the AUKUS program are set to be revealed Monday in San Diego during a joint news conference between Sunak, US President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

""This is about really having the type of stealth and the type of reach which the strategic environment requires,"" he said, naming ""China's missile force is really, in my opinion, the real reason that's driving this decision, because surface ships right now are so vulnerable,"" Courtney said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/08/europe/georgia-explainer-intl/index.html,"CNN Protests Georgia's ruling party announced Thursday morning it would scrap the controversial bill following two nights of widespread protests in Tbilisi over fears it would drive a wedge between the Caucasian nation and Europe. However, the announcement was met with caution among protesters who say they will continue to demonstrate until the government formally denounces the bill and releases all those who have been detained. The proposed legislation was compared to a draconian set of laws adopted in Russia and condemned by rights groups as a bid to curtail basic freedoms and crack down on dissent in the country. The developments sparked mass unrest, with thousands of demonstrators gathering outside Tbilisi's parliament building, waving not just the Georgian flag but also that of the European Union. Meanwhile, Moscow said it has been watching the two-day riots with concern. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday urged Russian nationals staying in the neighboring country to be cautious. ""This is our neighbouring state and despite the fact that we do not have relations with Georgia as such, the situation there cannot but cause our concern,"" Peskov said. He went on to advise Russian citizens to ""refrain from staying in areas where these street riots are taking place"" and to be ""extremely cautious."" Georgia, which won its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, has long been playing a balancing act between its citizens' pro-European sentiment and the geopolitical aims of its powerful neighbor, Russia. In March 2022, Here's a look at what the controversial law would have meant for Georgia, and how it reached this point. What was in the bills? According to Giorgi Gogia, associate director of the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch, two bills were being discussed in Georgia's parliament. The first bill would have required organizations including non-governmental groups and print, online and broadcast media to register as ""foreign agents"" if they receive 20% or more of their annual income from abroad. Those who do not comply would have faced fines of $9,600 US dollars (25,000 Georgian Lari). The second bill expanded the scope of ""agents of foreign influence"" to include individuals and increased the penalties for failure to comply from fines to up to five years in prison. For Gogia, the bills represented a clear threat to human rights in Georgia. ""They threaten to marginalize and discredit critical voices in the country. This threat is real,"" he told CNN on Tuesday ahead of its scrapping on Wednesday. ""Under the disguise of transparency, the latest statements by the Georgian authorities strongly suggest that if adopted, the law will be weaponized to further stigmatize and penalize independent groups, media and critical voices in the country."" The first draft law passed on Tuesday in a session that was broadcast live on the legislature's website, with 76 votes for and 13 against. The bill would have needed to pass further readings to become law. The President of Georgia, ""Those who support this law today, all those who voted for this law today are violating the Constitution. All of them are alienating us from Europe,"" Zourabichvili said in the clip on Tuesday. ""I said on day one that I would veto this law, and I will do that."" However, the country's ruling Georgian Dream party - of which Zourabichvili is not a member - would have had the parliamentary majority to overcome a presidential veto, according to Human Rights Watch. Which countries have imposed similar laws? Georgia's bill followed the model of a controversial law in neighboring Russia that has already imposed draconian restrictions and requirements on organizations and individuals with foreign ties, critics say. The law was initially passed in 2012 amid a wave of public protests over allegations of election-rigging and Vladimir Putin's intentions to return to the Russian presidency. It required organizations engaging in political activity and receiving funding from abroad to register as foreign agents and adhere to draconian rules and restrictions. Russia's law on Foreign Agents has been gradually updated since then, forming the backbone of an Gogia said the legislation is similar to the law in Russia in that it is ""trying to create a special status and legal regime for organizations and media that receive foreign funding and - under the disguise of transparency - interferes with freedom of associations and media and with their legitimate functions."" Asked during a press briefing Thursday if the Russian law had inspired the Georgian bill, Peskov said the Kremlin has ""nothing to do with this"" and pointed to legislation against so-called foreign agents in the US. Russia-aligned Belarus has had a citizenship law in place since 2002 that has a similar impact. In December 2022, the Belarusian parliament passed amendments to the law which would enable the government to target members of the political opposition, activists and other critics in exile, according to Human Rights Watch. The draft law would allow the president to strip Belarusians abroad of their citizenship, even if they have no other. Who is the driving force behind the legislation? The bills were nominally proposed by a faction in the parliament formed by members who left the ruling Georgian Dream party, but remained in the parliamentary majority, according to Gogia. ""However, the ruling Georgian Dream party fully and publicly supported the bills and campaigned for their adoption, and almost unanimously voted for it in the first reading yesterday,"" Gogia said. The European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), a think tank, believes the party is leading Georgia towards Russia's sphere of influence. ""In the last few years, and especially over the past 18 months, Georgia's ruling coalition has made a series of moves that seem designed to distance the country from the West and shift it gradually into Russia's sphere of influence,"" a report released by the ECFR in December said. It pointed to Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and billionaire, as a driving force behind this pivot towards Moscow. ""Much of the responsibility for this drift away from the EU lies with oligarch and former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose Georgian Dream Party dominates the governing coalition,"" the report said. Ivanishvili made a fortune while living in Russia during its turbulent transition to a market economy, and was part of an influential group of Russian bankers who supported the re-election of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1996, according to the ECFR. What comparisons have been drawn to Ukraine in 2014? Analysts have noted similarities between the situation in Georgia and Ukraine - both former Soviet republics which have found themselves caught between the East and the West. The think tank ECFR drew comparisons between the situation in Georgia and Russia's invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and 2022. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in 2011 that had Russia not invaded Georgia in 2008, NATO would have expanded into Georgia. The 2008 conflict centered on South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway provinces in Georgia. They are officially part of Georgia but have separate governments unrecognized by most countries. Both Abkhazia and South Ossetia are propped up by Russia. The ""In this light, Russia's wars in Georgia and Ukraine seem part of a single imperial project,"" the report said. How would the legislation impact Georgia? The Georgia bill was widely criticized as posing a potentially chilling effect for Georgian civil society, and particularly NGOs and news organizations with links to Europe. It would also hamper Georgia's bid to join the European Union. An EU statement Tuesday warned that the law would be ""incompatible with EU values and standards"" and could have ""serious repercussions on our relations."" In February, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price also said that ""anyone voting for this draft legislation"" could also imperil Georgia's relationship with Europe and the West. ""Georgia's international and bilateral partners have been very clear that adopting a 'foreign agent' bill would be inconsistent with Georgia's stated commitments to human rights and its Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" Gogia told CNN. ""I hope the Georgian authorities would heed to the warning and instead of passing the bills that would clearly impede the work of independent groups and media, they should ensure safe and enabling environment for civil society in the country.""","Caught between the West and Russia, could Georgia be the next Ukraine?"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/08/politics/white-house-populist-messaging/index.html,"CNN As the President Joe Biden enters a make-or-break The message - that lawmakers are either with Biden or against him, for cutting costs or against them, for making real progress or reverting to the status quo - has become more pronounced in public remarks from Biden and top White House officials just as lawmakers enter the most high-stakes moment of months of It's also become a focal point ""The real choice right now is whether you're going to lower costs for people in this country on elder care, childcare, cost of college or whether you're going to allow the wealthiest Americans and corporations to continue to pay the tax rates that are hardly fair moving forward,"" Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, The White House and congressional Democrats are in the midst of feverish negotiations over the shape of the final proposal and face a series of critical differences or outright disputes to resolve on key policy areas in a matter of weeks. Those talks come as the White House grapples with no margin for error in the Senate, where Democrats can't afford to lose a single vote and already face a call for a pause in the process from moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat. Speaker Nancy Pelosi only has a three-vote margin to work with in the House - and moderates in the House Democratic caucus have their own anxieties about the direction of the proposal, according to sources on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue. Republicans are unified in their opposition to the package and have moved to sharply attack its scale, particularly in a moment of elevated inflation, over the course of the last several months. ""I've never seen a bigger threat to America fundamentally than this bill I just described, which will be slugging it out on floor in the next couple of months,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said this week in remarks referring to the Democrats spending package. ""Not a single Republican, not one, will support it."" But while the details of the package are still a matter of intense debate inside the party, so is the ability to convey what it would actually do if signed into law, something officials acknowledge is a critical component to keeping Democrats across the spectrum unified as things move toward an end-game. The messaging shift marks an intentional effort to simplify the choice facing Democrats in the weeks ahead, many of which have been wavering about the scale and scope of Biden's plan. The President's sagging approval numbers after an August defined by crises and questions about the speed of negotiations have only served to complicate things as lawmakers return to Washington this month. Now, the focus is on cutting costs on everything from prescription drugs and health care to childcare and education. The message on financing the package is that the rich and corporations will pay their fair share. ""The President's agenda will ease the burden of high costs on working families, deliver significant tax cuts to the middle class, and create millions of jobs, while making the super-wealthy and profitable corporations pay their fair share,"" said one of the opening paragraphs of a White House polling memo obtained by CNN that was circulated on Wednesday to congressional Democrats and outside allies. What followed was three pages of data, touching on everything from overall views of Biden's agenda nationally, his approach with the middle class and the popularity of specific provisions within the proposal. All were framed as sharply positive. The White House also highlighted a poll that showed what they framed as ""durable support"" in key swing districts and among independent voters - something they plan to push to moderate lawmakers often in the weeks ahead. White House advisers have always touted what they continue to view as a proposal that, from paid leave to universal pre-kindergarten, carries a clear level of popularity. But they also spent weeks focused on countering the inflation argument and months highlighting specific elements of the proposal before settling this summer on the popularity of lowering prescription drug costs as the most potent message. They've circulated poll after poll in an effort to underscore to skittish moderate Democrats that the tax increases they propose to pay for the plan carry wide public support. Those efforts won't disappear entirely. Manchin's mention of inflation as one of his primary concerns has drawn regular administration attention. But White House officials are keen on framing things as a binary - and more populist - choice. Gone are dives into the weeds and merits of the tax policy. The word ""reconciliation,"" the key procedural mechanism Democrats will utilize to bypass the Senate filibuster, was more or less banned weeks ago.  In its place: ""President Biden believes this comes down to a simple proposition: Scranton, PA v. Park Avenue,"" Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, wrote in a memo to her House Democratic counterparts this week.","White House moves to sharper, populist message to keep Democrats together in make-or-break agenda moment"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/nasa-ice-sheet-loss-climate-change-trnd/index.html,"CNN The Earth is losing ice at a record speed chiefly due to warming from the ocean caused by climate change. A According to NASA, the amount of ice lost could cover New York's This loss of ice has caused the sea level to rise by about half an inch between 2003 and 2019. That's slightly less than a third of the total amount of sea level rise observed in the world's oceans, according to the study. And although East Antarctica has gained some ice, that gain is little compared to the total amount of ice lost in the other areas. Warmer summer temperatures are chiefly to blame for this ice loss, according to NASA. The warm temperatures have melted ice from the surface of the glaciers and ice sheets. NASA says it recorded the data from its Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), which was launched in 2018 to make detailed global elevation measurements, including over the Earth's frozen regions. That data was then compared with measurements taken by the original ICESat from 2003 to 2009, allowing researchers to generate a complete picture of the complexities of ice sheet change and insights into the future of Greenland and Antarctica. ""If you watch a glacier or ice sheet for a month, or a year, you're not going to learn much about what the climate is doing to it,"" said Ben Smith, a glaciologist at the University of Washington and lead author of the new paper. He told NASA, ""We now have a 16-year span between ICESat and ICESat-2 and can be much more confident that the changes we're seeing in the ice have to do with the long-term changes in the climate."" Alex Gardner, a glaciologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and co-author of the Science paper, told NASA that the new analysis reveals the ice sheets' response to changes in climate in great detail, revealing clues as to why and how the ice sheets are reacting the way they are. The NASA study also looked at ice shelves: the floating masses of ice at the downstream end of glaciers. The researchers found ice shelves are losing mass in West Antarctica, where many of the continent's fastest-moving glaciers are located as well, according to NASA. NASA explains that ice that melts from ice shelves doesn't raise sea levels, since it's already floating - just like an ice cube already in a full cup of water doesn't overflow the glass when it melts. But the ice shelves provide stability for the glaciers and ice sheets behind them. ""It's like an architectural buttress that holds up a cathedral,"" says Helen Amanda Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, and co-author of the Science paper. She told NASA, ""The ice shelves hold the ice sheet up. If you take away the ice shelves, or even if you thin them, you're reducing that buttressing force, so the grounded ice can flow faster."" This study was conducted over 16 years and published online in Science April 30.","Ocean warming is causing massive ice sheet loss in Greenland and Antarctica, NASA study shows"

Within a matter of months, she and her fellow Iranians lost the limited rights they had enjoyed under the country's previous government, itself a repressive monarchy. When Nemat dared to protest against the new regime, she was arrested and sent to the notorious Wai Hnin Pwint Thon was already four years old when she first met her father, Ko Mya Aye, a democratic activist who had been Though at first she thought he was being treated well, the iron bars that prevented her from embracing her father soon jolted Wai Hnin to reality. In that moment, she says, a child became an aspiring voice for human rights, one who would speak out over the nearly three decades since that meeting - as her father was repeatedly imprisoned, most recently after the military's February coup. Wai Hnin, now living in exile, Evan Mawarire never got to experience freedom in his country. By the time he turned three, Robert Mugabe had become Zimbabwe's prime minister - and for the In 2016, Mawarire, now a pastor, concluded that the status quo in Zimbabwe could not stand. Corruption was rampant, deflation His decision to post a Mawarire, Nemat and Wai Hnin are among the 21st century's freedom fighters - people who have risked their lives and liberty in a battle for democracy that is being fought globally. In this series, ""Voices of Freedom,"" 13 dissidents from around the world are telling their stories and making the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections. They are active participants in the Decline of global freedom The stakes could not be higher. Freedom House, a nonprofit research organization, put this battle in almost apocalyptic terms in its annual report on liberty. ""As a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world in 2020, democracy's defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,"" The organization labeled 2020 ""the 15th consecutive year of decline in global freedom"" and determined that On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of insurrectionists Five people Though their efforts ultimately failed, the threat of another insurrection looms large over future US elections. A March poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core Equally alarming is that, according to a late summer CNN poll, As she has struggled to build a young democracy in her home country, Manneh writes, ""it wasn't just American influence that made me demand better from the Gambian government - it was knowing that America was there that made me believe that I could succeed."" Imperfect and as unequal as it may be, she says, the United States ""is still the most potent global force for freedom, and without it the world... faces a dark future."" Compounding problems, economic forces - including growing inequality - and the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put new stress on nations struggling with the challenge of autocracy. China and Russia are among the nations that are seeking to demonstrate that their systems of governance However, the Chinese government rejects the authoritarian label. In September, the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, These words follow a familiar pattern from Chinese officials who, There is a point to this game of political semantics, says Stone Fish. It forces a debate within the US and other western democracies about something that should be obvious - that China's government does not meet any internationally accepted definition of democracy. It also helps to distract from allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, censorship of the press and crackdowns on civil society (all of which the Chinese government denies). But this debate does not negate a reality that many leaders of western democracies are acutely aware of - a The hallmarks of democracy There is one feature all democracies share in common - they give power to the people, whether directly or through some form of elected representation. For activist and RDI chairman Garry Kasparov, who has been on the frontlines of battling Russian repression for over three decades, that's a system worth fighting for - even if it comes at great cost. He Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, tells CNN that an active citizenry is a hallmark of democracy. She argues that strong democracies have robust civil societies capable of engaging in the kinds of collective action Kasparov initiated in Russia but was arrested for partaking in. Simply put, citizens living in democracies should be able to express their dissent without risking retribution. And, Berman explains, they have multiple mechanisms to do so - whether by voting in elections in which two or more political parties are on the ballot, bringing lawsuits before an independent judiciary, writing or calling their elected leaders or taking to the streets in protest. Beyond the political characteristics that define a democracy, there are the social and economic factors that are critical to its success, says Berman. A real democracy must provide some form of social equality to all of its citizens, regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity. For Wai Hnin, social equality is one feature that has been sorely missing from Myanmar's government, even as it instituted some democratic reforms prior to this year's military coup. The most obvious example is the horrendous treatment of the country's Muslim minority, the Rohingya. In late 2016, the Burmese military began Though Myanmar's 2008 constitution forbids discrimination against any religious or ethnic minority, it also includes a section But just as important as social equality is economic equality, which - when secured - gives citizens the opportunity to focus on other pressing issues. Unfortunately, according to Thomas Carothers, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, over the last four years, He and former Carnegie fellow David Wong In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who might not have been competitive otherwise, The battle for freedom Bolsonaro's campaign was built on one of the biggest criticisms of western democracy today - that even though citizens may still freely vote for their elected leaders, many of those leaders are self-serving elites who are out of touch with the economic and social needs of those they supposedly serve. That logic, Stuenkel explains, ""makes putting a radical who...lacks any qualification to govern a more appealing option."" It goes far beyond Brazil. Across the world, far-right and far-left leaders have exploited people's dissatisfaction with political elites and their maintenance of the status quo, Michael Abramowitz, President of Freedom House, tells CNN. Hungary offers a powerful example. In the 2010 election, Hungarians And, according to several metrics, Orban has addressed some of these dire economic realities. As of 2018, when he was elected for a third time, Hungary's official unemployment figures and government debt Any economic gains have not come without a high political price, though. Since Orban became prime minister, he and his party have chipped away at Hungarian democracy, pushing through a series of significant constitutional and legislative changes that have expanded his control of many of the country's independent institutions - More recently, his government ""has moved to institute policies that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who criticize it or whose perspectives it otherwise finds unfavorable,"" The threat of misinformation Dissatisfaction with the status quo isn't the only factor undermining democracies today. Abramowitz explains there have been dramatic changes in our ""information environment."" In the early days of the internet and social media, activists One recent example is Russian attempts to impact democratic elections abroad with digital disinformation campaigns. Steven Wilson, an assistant professor of politics at Brandeis University, One country where the impact of these kinds of campaigns has been felt is And while Trump's 2016 electoral victory cannot be entirely credited to Putin, it appears Russian efforts succeeded in both undermining some Americans' faith in US democracy and in giving Putin a disinformation playbook he could apply ""to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,"" Indeed, the US intelligence community assessed that Putin, although unsuccessful in swaying the election in Trump's favor, According to Abramowitz, this is part of a dangerous pattern of copycat behavior among autocrats - learning worst practices from each other and using them to undermine trust in democracy. This web of digital disinformation has only exacerbated Americans' loss of faith in government and institutions, which The clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump's lie that he really won the 2020 election. Despite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden's victory in the minds of the American people - at Turning the tide on authoritarianism At the Oslo Freedom Forum in October, Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez This is no easy task. Hahrie Han, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, explains to CNN that democracy is only as strong as people's commitment to it, and that commitment has waned in recent years. However, civic institutions - from schools to houses of worship to social clubs - can play a key role in strengthening democracies at home and abroad. Fundamentally, democracies demand that citizens accept they may not always get the electoral outcome that they want. Civic institutions, where people begin to encounter individuals and ideas they may disagree with, can teach the values of negotiation, compromise and even acceptance of a less than desirable outcome, she says. Linda Chavez, a conservative political commentator and RDI board member, believes the most important civic institution may be schools. In the US, she tells CNN, many students have received a ""comic book version of history with superheroes and supervillains,"" but without a deeper understanding of the struggle to expand American democracy to more and more citizens. It's no surprise, Chavez says, that Proving democracy works While civic education is a critical piece of the democratic puzzle, there are additional efforts that must be taken to strengthen US commitment to democracy. And one of them must target the many Americans who have come to believe Trump's election lies. Chavez says that conservatives must lead that effort. ""The Constitution - which conservatives have always claimed to owe allegiance to - is under attack. Trump's tenure was marked by his flouting of the rule of law and separation of powers, and now he is being aided by those who previously claimed to [be] champions of those very principles,"" she writes to CNN. Chavez hopes that Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, though in the minority, can serve as models for speaking truth to Trump and his allies' dangerous assertions of power. Beyond outreach to disbelieving Republicans, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, tells CNN that democratic activists must tap into the American population which does not vote or participate in the political process at all. In the 2020 US presidential election, which saw record voter turnout, about 80 million eligible voters still Ben-Ghiat explains that voter registration and mobilization efforts must target these potential voters - and must do a more effective job at explaining how their votes can translate into concrete actions by elected representatives. Carothers says one way to plead this case is to show proof of concept. When Congress and the White House are able to work together to solve pressing issues facing the American public - such as economic inequality or aging infrastructure - they can argue that a system of governance, often plagued by gridlock, can also be a force for good in people's day-to-day lives. And while this may seem an impossible task against the backdrop of America's fractured politics, it is urgent that the nation's elected leaders and citizens model the kind of behavior befitting a democracy. After the events of Jan. 6, RDI began hearing from activists and dissidents about the need for the US to quickly change course and set a worldwide example for true freedom. They wanted to ""remind us of the importance of America's founding values to our own success and to the global community as a whole,"" Uriel Epshtein, Executive Director of RDI, tells CNN. In response, RDI launched the Beyond a firm commitment to secure voting rights and uphold democratic election results, those principles include protecting free speech and free press rights. As the signatories explain, we cannot defeat ""illiberalism with illiberalism,"" but rather with the creation of a space where ideas and opinions, however controversial or provocative, may be shared and debated. Inspiring bold citizens As democratic legislative bodies debate the parameters of these freedoms, they can still invest time and resources in strengthening civil society. And while a robust civil society is critical to the maintenance of democracies, it is perhaps even more critical in countries where activists are trying to lay the foundations of democracy. For example, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a whistleblower during the Trump administration, and Belarussian dissident Andrei Sannikov This kind of aid is far more practical, explains Roland Rich, an assistant teaching professor at Rutgers University and former Australian diplomat. Government-to-government aid, especially when one of the parties involved is not a democracy, is often highly ineffective in bringing about tangible change. However, he argues, ""people-to-people aid"" can empower citizens and civil society to organize and push for the freedoms they deserve. For Mawarire, who continues the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe, Rich's thinking mirrors his mobilization efforts on the ground. He explains that one of his country's democratic slogans has become, ""If we cannot cause the politician to change, then we must inspire the citizen to be bold."" And while international support for democratic efforts can often play a critical role, Mawarire believes that much of the push for freedom must come from within countries where citizens are struggling against the weight of autocracy. The beauty of his advocacy work, he says, is helping fellow Zimbabweans recognize their agency in the political process and then driving them to say, ""I'm not going to sit in the terraces or bleachers to watch other people [build democracy]. I'm doing it myself."" Democracy does not blossom overnight. Mawarire compares it to growing a garden and waiting patiently for the seeds of freedom to blossom. It may take time, but ""there's going to be a generation that's going to harvest the fruits of democracy,"" he says. Until then, all those who believe in the values of a free and open society must tend to the garden, watering, cultivating, and, when necessary, removing the weeds of autocracy that threaten to compromise its growth.

""(Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer) will not have my vote on $3.5 (trillion) and Chuck knows that, and we've talked about this,"" the West Virginia senator told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" Manchin's stance underscores the challenge facing Democratic leadership as they work to advance the sprawling spending bill proposed by President Joe Biden and his allies in the narrowly divided Congress. And he's not the only Democrat expressing reservations, potentially imperiling the bill, which leadership hopes to pass with just Democratic votes. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement Sunday evening that he believes the spending bill ""falls short"" because there is not enough funding for housing assistance. ""We have an obligation to use this historic investment to address longstanding inequities of power and opportunity that have left Black families with an average net worth one-tenth the size of their white counterparts,"" Warner said. Democrats need every vote in their caucus to get the bill through the Senate along straight party lines, and multiple moderates have raised red flags, with Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona indicating they do not support spending $3.5 trillion. ""We've already put out $5.4 trillion and we've tried to help Americans in every way we possibly can and a lot of the help that we've put out there is still there and it's going to run clear until next year, 2022, so what's the urgency? What's the urgency that we have?"" Manchin said. ""It's not the same urgency that we had with the American Rescue Plan. We got that out the door quickly. That was about $2 trillion."" The spending bill spreads the spending out over 10 years as opposed to the Covid stimulus plans that Manchin referred to, which were more immediate injections of cash. Manchin pours cold water on Pelosi's timeline Manchin said he wants to slow down the timeline, as he suggested in ""So we have done an awful lot, and there's still an awful lot of people that need help but there are still 11 million jobs that aren't filled right now. Eight million people are still unemployed. Something's not matching up. Don't you think we ought to hit the pause and find out? The vulnerability that we have right now, we don't know what happened with this Covid, it's awful coming back the way it is with a vengeance,"" he said. ""We don't know about inflation, we know it's running rampant right now, I can tell you in West Virginia inflation is running rampant, and on top of that, the challenges we're going to have, geopolitical challenges, shouldn't we be prepared?"" He added that he doesn't believe passing the economic bill by the September 27 deadline laid out by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can be done. ""There's no way we can get this done by the 27th if we do our job,"" he said. ""There's so much differences that we have here and so much, there's so much apart from us to where we are as far as our I'm giving you different things, I've been talking, I've been working with people, I'm going to talk to people, that makes no sense at all,"" he said. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is writing the bill, said Sunday it is ""not acceptable"" that Manchin won't support the bill. ""I don't think it's acceptable for the President, to the American people or to the overwhelming majority of the people in the Democratic caucus,"" Sanders told Bash in a separate interview. ""Look, we worked with Sen. Manchin to pass the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which was enormously consequential and helpful to working class families in getting us out of the economic disaster that befell us as a result of Covid. I believe we're going to all sit down and work together and come up with a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, which deals with the enormously unmet needs of working families."" Asked if he was willing to give the bill more time for consideration, the Budget chairman said a ""few days here and there doesn't matter,"" adding there is a ""sense of urgency."" Pelosi last month acquiesced to moderate Democrats and agreed to hold a vote by September 27 on the infrastructure bill. But if the reconciliation proposal hasn't passed the Senate by then, it's unclear whether they would have the votes to push through the infrastructure bill and send it to Biden's desk. How to pay for the bill Asked by Bash how he would pay for the economic bill, Manchin replied that he was in favor of raising taxes on corporations, saying: ""I want to increase taxes on corporations, I've spoken to corporations, I want the wealthy to pay their fair share."" The senator also suggested he wants to see the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed as soon as possible, saying it's urgent that lawmakers address the issue, which has been ""left unattended for over 30 years."" ""That's the one the President went out and campaigned on that, that's his bill - we worked it in a bipartisan way, got 19 Republicans to vote for it, that's the bill that should go out immediately,"" he said. Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, also told Bash it would be a ""really sad state of affairs"" if both the reconciliation bill and the infrastructure bill failed but said he doesn't believe that will happen.

The countries together make up 80% of the world's emissions. The analysis also included some low-emissions countries, and found that the Gambia was the only nation among all 37 to be ""1.5 compatible."" As the study only included a few smaller emitters, it's possible there are other developing countries in the world on track as well. Under the 2015 Paris accord, more than 190 countries agreed to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures - ideally to 1.5 degrees. Scientists have said 2 degrees is a critical threshold for some of the Earth's ecosystems, and is one that would also trigger more catastrophic extreme weather events. The report comes less than two months ahead of UN-brokered international climate talks in Glasgow, known as COP26. The event's president, British MP Alok Sharma, has said he hopes to ""keep 1.5 alive"" as a global warming limit.

""But since then, there has been little to no improvement: nothing is moving,"" he said. ""Anyone would think they have all the time in the world, when in fact the opposite is the case."" Six countries, including the UK, have an overall climate policy that is ""nearly sufficient,"" according to the report, meaning they are not yet consistent with 1.5-degree alignment but could be with small improvements. The UK's targets are in line with 1.5 degrees, but its policies in practice don't meet the benchmark. The overall climate plans of the US, CAT had previously categorized the US as ""critically insufficient"" - the worst category - under former President Donald Trump, who formally withdrew the country from the Paris Agreement shortly before the end of his term. The United States' domestic emission-cutting target has since been upgraded to ""almost sufficient."" However, the US is still insufficient in CAT's ""fair share"" target rating, which takes into account the country's ""responsibility and capability."" Under the Paris agreement, countries submitted their pledges to cut emissions, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs. All signatories were supposed to update their NDCs by July 31 this year under the Paris accord. There are still more than 70 countries that have yet to submit an update. India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are among countries that missed the July 31 deadline. China, the world's biggest polluter, announced a new target, but hasn't formally submitted it to the UN. And many countries submitted an ""update"" without actually increasing their pledge. Brazil and Mexico submitted the same targets as they did in 2015. Changes to those countries' baseline assumptions make their pledges weaker than they were before, the analysis showed. Russia, the CAT report said, submitted an update that looks stronger on paper, but doesn't amount to meaningful change. ""Of particular concern are The continued use of coal remains a significant policy problem, the report found, with China and India retaining huge coal pipelines. Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea are also planning to go ahead with coal use in the future. CAT also warned that in many countries' attempts to wean of coal, which is generally the fossil fuels that causes the most emissions, many countries were looking to use more natural gas, which CAT said was being falsely sold as a ""bridging fuel."" The Australian government, which has said it will keep mining coal past 2030, is also investing money into new gas exploration and infrastructure, and ""is of particular concern,"" CAT said in its report. Thailand has plans to ramp up new gas as it phases out coal, while the EU is still planning to commit public funding to new gas infrastructure, and various member states are lobbying hard for the continued use of this fossil fuel. Hare warned against the development of blue hydrogen, based on natural gas, as an alternative to other fossil fuels. ""Gas is a fossil fuel, and any investment into gas today risks becoming a stranded asset. And while interest in green hydrogen has grown exponentially, there is still a large number of hydrogen projects in the pipeline where it's produced from gas,"" Hare said. ""Hydrogen produced from gas still produces carbon, and is inconsistent with reaching net zero."" Net zero by 2050 Cutting emissions is a non-negotiable part of the Paris Accord. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap solar radiation in the atmosphere, just like glass traps heat in a greenhouse. This causes temperatures to rise and drives more extreme weather, ice melt, sea level rise and ocean acidification. To keep the warming under 1.5 degrees, the world needs to reach net zero by 2050, a Net zero refers to a state when the amount of greenhouse gas emitted is no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere. According to UN Climate Change, just over 130 countries have pledged to cut emissions to net-zero so far. The new analysis by CAT found that even if all of them followed up on their plans, warming would still reach 2 degrees. If they stick with the policies they have in place, temperatures will likely be 2.4 degrees higher by the end of century. Temperatures are already around 1.2 degrees higher than they were before humans started burning huge amounts of fossil fuels, so ""An increasing number of people around the world are suffering from ever more severe and frequent impacts of climate change, yet government action continues to lag behind what is needed,"" said Bill Hare, the CEO of the think tank Climate Analytics and another author of the analysis. While many governments have committed to net zero, Hare said that without a real action soon, achieving net zero will be ""virtually impossible.""","Not a single G20 country is in line with the Paris Agreement on climate, analysis shows"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/12/politics/house-reconciliation-package-explainer/index.html,"CNN After months of negotiations and passage in the House last month, President Joe Biden's sweeping $1.75 trillion economic and climate package was dealt a major blow on Sunday when a key Democratic senator said The legislation, which is currently before the Senate, would transform the nation's social safety net despite being whittled down to roughly half its original size amid infighting between the party's moderate and progressive wings. It would create a universal pre-K program, assist families with child care and send them the It would funnel The legislation would increase the deficit by $367 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But that doesn't count revenue raised from enhanced tax enforcement, which the office found would bring in $207 billion over 10 years. The bill's path in the Senate remains uncertain after Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat of West Virginia, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he ""cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation."" Manchin, along with some other Democrats, had voiced concerns about various provisions in the bill, as well as the speed at which it is going through Congress. Democrats were planning to use a procedure called reconciliation so that they can approve the bill in the Senate with just 50 votes, which would alleviate the need for support from Republicans. But since the Democrats have only 50 members in the chamber, Manchin's newly stated opposition to the bill is a significant issue for its survival. Here's what's in it:    A program that provides four weeks of paid family and sick leave would cost $205.5 billion, according to the CBO.  Heads of household earning up to $112,500 and joint filers making up to $150,000 annually would qualify for the enhanced payments. But, unlike in 2021, only these families would receive the funds in monthly installments next year. Eligible parents with higher incomes would have to claim the credit on their tax return the following year. The credit would be made permanently refundable so the lowest income families would continue to qualify. The enhancement, which was part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package Democrats enacted earlier this year, is currently only in place for 2021. This credit, along with the earned income tax credit, would cost about $203 billion, according to The House bill unveiled in September would have extended the credit through 2025.  The earlier House bill would have extended it permanently.  It also aims to improve the quality of caregiving jobs. The measure would cost nearly $158 billion, according to the CBO. Originally, Biden had hoped to shower $400 billion on this effort as part of his infrastructure package.  This provision, along with Medicaid expansion, would cost $126 billion, according to the White House's latest estimate. And the number of uninsured Americans would drop by 3.4 million, mainly due to the subsidies extension and the Medicaid provision, according to the CBO. The initial House bill would have made the enhancement permanent. The legislation also would extend for one year a provision of the American Rescue Plan that allows those This provision would cost $74 billion, according to the CBO.  Doing so would cost about $57 billion, the CBO estimates. The original House bill would have provided premium subsidies to low-income Americans until the Department of Health and Human Services would have set up a federal Medicaid expansion program that would have picked up the entire tab for enrollees' medical care. However, several Democrats from states that already expanded Medicaid The bill would also increase the federal assistance for expansion states to 93% through 2025. And it would require state Medicaid programs to provide 12 months of eligibility to women after they give birth. States now typically provide 60 days of coverage.  Only 30% of seniors over age 70 who could benefit from hearing aids have ever used them, the White House said. This measure would cost $36.7 billion, according to the CBO.  The legislation also calls  The measure would also invest in down payment assistance and in community-led redevelopment projects in under-resourced neighborhoods. And it would provide $24 billion to fund housing vouchers and supportive services. The effort would cost about $148.1 billion, according to the CBO.  It would invest in historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve underrepresented communities. And it would increase funding for workforce development. These provisions would cost a total of   But the Senate parliamentarian, who has the final say on whether the legislation adheres to procedural rules, has  But many Democrats are opposed to lifting the cap, which would largely benefit Here's how Democrats will pay for it The Democrats The party then floated a Biden and congressional Democratic leaders Under the House version, most middle-income families with children would get Overall, nearly 40% of households would see a tax cut and nearly 19% would pay more in 2022 than they do now, according to the analysis. However, about 70% of those earning more than $1 million a year would enjoy a tax cut.  Also, it would impose a 15% minimum tax, calculated on a country-by-country basis, that American companies pay on foreign profits, consistent with an agreement Biden recently won among 136 countries. The provisions would yield an estimated $814 billion, the Joint Committee on Taxation said.  Next year, about 30,000 tax filers are expected to make $10 million or more, according to the Tax Policy Center. About 12,000 of them are likely to earn at least $25 million. The bill  The CBO estimates that the provision would raise revenue by $207 billion - far less than the $400 billion that the Treasury Department had projected. But White House officials have been  The legislation would also impose penalties if drug companies increase their prices faster than inflation. And it would redesign Medicare's Part D drug plans so that seniors and people with disabilities wouldn't pay more than $2,000 for medications bought at the pharmacy. The bill would also cap what Americans pay for insulin at $35 a month. About 10 fewer drugs would be introduced in the US market over the next three decades if the bill were enacted, the CBO projects. About 1,300 drugs are expected to be approved over that time period under current law, the agency said.  Altogether, the prescription drug measures would save around $297 billion, including about $79 billion from allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, according to the CBO.

The rate would apply to individuals with taxable income over $400,000 a year and married couples filing jointly earning over $450,000 annually. The top capital gains rate would increase to 25%, from 20%. In addition, lawmakers would slap a 3% surtax on individuals with adjusted gross incomes in excess of $5 million. And it would broaden the net investment income tax to cover net income derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business for single taxpayers with greater than $400,000 in taxable income or joint filers with earnings greater than $500,000. Currently, as part of the Affordable Care Act, some higher-income Americans are subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on certain investment income and an 0.9% Medicare surcharge on wages. Altogether, the additional levies on high-income individuals would raise approximately $1 trillion. The proposal also calls for increasing the top corporate tax rate to 26.5%, up from the current 21% set by the Republicans' 2017 tax cut law. It would only apply to businesses with income in excess of $5 million. Biden had called for And the House proposal would raise the minimum tax on foreign earnings of US companies to 16.5%, from the current 10.5%. Biden had suggested pushing it up to 21%. The plan would also increase a variety of other taxes on the wealthy and businesses, among other measures, including modifying rules involving cryptocurrency transactions. It would also give the Internal Revenue Service an additional $80 billion over the next 10 years for All told, the measures would raise an estimated $2.9 trillion, though the plan cautions that ""this number remains very preliminary."" When combined with an estimated $600 billion in dynamic revenue growth estimated by the White House, the proposal would fully offset the cost of the Democrats' budget package, according to the drafters. Hitting hurdles over size Aware that they will get no Republican support for their massive expansion of the nation's safety net system, Democrats are planning to pass the package through the reconciliation process, which requires no GOP votes in the Senate. Thirteen House committees are crafting the legislation that will make up the massive package in coming days, with a target of submitting detailed bills by Wednesday. Democratic leaders hope to hold a floor vote later this month. But battles have already broken out within the Democratic party, with Manchin's comments prompted Sen. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Budget Committee that laid out recommendations for the sweeping plan, to tell Bash in a separate interview that it is ""not acceptable"" that Manchin won't support the bill. What House Democrats are proposing The 10-year spending plan marks the latest step in the Democrats' drive to expand education, health care and child care support, tackle the climate crisis and make further investments in infrastructure. Party leaders are hoping to use the annual budget process to push through many of the measures envisioned in Biden's jobs and families proposals that Republican opposition have blocked.

She added, ""To all those who have perpetrated these crimes, and to their superiors who are complicit in those crimes, you will be held to account."" The declaration marks the strongest accusation yet from the US as it seeks to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The US government Blinken echoed Harris' remarks Saturday in a statement released by the State Department. ""We reserve crimes against humanity determinations for the most egregious crimes,"" he said. ""These acts are not random or spontaneous; they are part of the Kremlin's widespread and systematic attack against Ukraine's civilian population."" While the latest crimes against humanity determination is significant, it remains largely symbolic for now. It does not immediately trigger any specific consequences, nor does it give the US the ability to prosecute the Russians involved with perpetrating crimes against humanity. However, it could provide Laying out the evidence Harris' announcement Saturday comes days before the one-year anniversary of Harris said Saturday that as a former prosecutor who began ""as young lawyer in the court room and later running California's Department of Justice,"" she knew ""firsthand the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law."" In her speech, delivered inside the famed Bayerischer Hof hotel in Munich, Harris laid bare some of what could be used as evidence of Russia's crimes against humanity. The vice president outlined specific instances that have peppered news clips and official reports. ""First, from the starting days of this unprovoked war, we have witnessed Russian forces engage in horrendous atrocities and war crimes,"" Harris said. ""Russian forces have pursued a widespread and systemic attack against a civilian population - gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape, and deportation. Execution-style killings, beating and electrocution,"" she added. ""Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine to Russia, including children. They have cruelly separated children from their families."" Harris' speech cited evidence of indiscriminate Russian attacks that deliberately targeted civilians, including the ""Barbaric and inhumane,"" Harris said. Since 2022, the US has provided $30 million to support the investigation of war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine, according to a White House fact sheet. The Biden administration is seeking another nearly $30 million from Congress to bolster efforts on this issue. As it was when the US government declared that Russia committed war crimes last March, it remains to be seen whether there will be any accountability for those accused of carrying out the alleged crimes and whether Russian President Still Harris vowed Saturday that the US would support the judicial process. ""In the face of these indisputable facts, to all of us here in Munich, let us renew our commitment to accountability. Let us renew our commitment to the rule of law,"" she said. ""As for the United States, we will continue to support the judicial process in Ukraine and international investigations because justice must be served. Let us all agree, on behalf of all the victims, known and unknown: Justice must be served."" 'For as long as it takes' Harris, in her speech Saturday, pledged that the US would ""strongly support"" Ukraine ""for as long as it takes,"" touting the Ukrainian people's resolve and resilience. ""There will be more dark days in Ukraine. The daily agony of war will persist,"" she said. ""But if Putin thinks he can wait us out, he's badly mistaken. Time is not on his side."" Questions have swirled in recent months about how much more funding the US will provide to Ukraine's war effort, now that Republicans are in charge of the US House of Repsentatives and have ""They are here together because they understand the stakes. The leadership of these members has been vital to America's support of Ukraine, and President Biden and I know that their support for Ukraine will continue,"" the vice president said. Blinken said Saturday that the US government has a ""profound stake"" in a ""just and durable"" peace in Ukraine. ""Any peace has to be consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter. It is fundamentally against the interests of every other country around the world to wind up with a result that somehow indicates the seizure by force of territory, that validates that,"" Blinken said during a discussion panel in Munich with Annalena Baerbock and Dmytro Kuleba, his respective German and Ukrainian counterparts. ""Because if we do that, we will open a Pandora's box around the world, and every would-be aggressor will conclude that if Russia got away with it, we can get away with it. And that's not in anyone's interest because it's a recipe for a world of conflict,"" he added. Also in Munich, CIA Director Bill Burns said Saturday that intelligence sharing with NATO allies has proved essential to supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion. ""It's a two-way street. We've learned a lot from our NATO partners. We learn a lot from the Ukrainians as well,"" Burns said in a separate panel discussion. That, he said, ""has been the kind of essential cement in the coalition that the president has organized."" Warnings about China Meanwhile, Harris expressed concern over ""We have also seen nations like North Korea and Iran send weapons in support of Russia's brutal war. We are also troubled that Beijing has deepened its relationship with Moscow since the war began,"" Harris said. ""Looking ahead, any steps by China to provide lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continue the killing and further undermine a rules-based order,"" she said. The US recently began seeing ""disturbing"" trendlines in China's support for Russia's military, US officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN, and there are signs that Beijing wants to ""creep up to the line"" of providing lethal military aid to Russia without getting caught. The officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China's posture, but they said it has concerned US officials enough to share the intelligence with allies and partners at the Munich conference over the past several days. Officials said the US is seeing China publicly trying to maintain relationships with Europe and present itself as a proponent of peace, while at the same time continuing to partner with the Russian military during large-scale exercises and boosting its trade and fuel purchases from Moscow. China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said Saturday in Munich that Beijing was ready to present its peace proposition for Ukraine, a rare remark that referred to the Ukraine conflict as a war. ""This warfare cannot continue to rage on,"" he said. ""We need to think about what efforts we can make to bring this warfare to an end.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/07/middleeast/hostages-hamas-israel-gaza/index.html,"CNN Hamas captured a number of Israelis during its deadly attack on Israel on Saturday, the Israeli military said, as videos emerged of Israeli soldiers and civilians being taken away by fighters from the Palestinian militant group. Meanwhile Israelis are sharing photos of friends and family who they say have apparently been kidnapped by Hamas fighters and are urging the public to help spread the word in the hope of getting them back safely. Hamas fired rockets from Gaza and sent gunmen into Israeli territory, prompting Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare that the At least 232 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Saturday, with 1,697 injured, the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said in a statement. At least one Israeli soldier has been taken prisoner, a new video geolocated and authenticated by CNN shows. The video, posted to Hamas' official social media accounts, shows militants yank two clearly terrified and stunned soldiers out of a disabled tank. It's unclear from the video how the tank was disabled, but Hamas has used drones to drop bombs onto Israeli tanks before. One of the soldiers is then seen in a short snippet of video being kicked on the ground by the militants. In another clip, the soldier is seen lying motionless on the ground. The second soldier is seen being led away by Hamas militants. A third soldier - his face very bloody - is seen lying on the ground motionless near the tank track. CNN does not know the current whereabouts or status of the three soldiers. A second video, taken afterward, shows a number of different armed men around the tank. The three soldiers are nowhere to be seen. The armed men are then seen pulling a fourth Israeli soldier from the tank. The soldier is motionless as he's dragged down the side of the tank and onto the ground. The armed men are seen stomping on his body. The Izzedine al Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claimed to capture ""dozens"" of Israelis on Saturday. ""We bring good news to our (Palestinian) prisoners and our people that the al Qassam Brigades have dozens of captured (Israeli) officers and soldiers in their hands,"" Al Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obaida said in a post on Telegram. ""They have been secured in safe places and resistance tunnels."" In a recorded audio message released later Saturday, Obaida said that all captured Israelis ""are present in all axes in the Gaza Strip."" ""What happens to the people of the Gaza Strip will happen to them and beware of miscalculation,"" he added. On Saturday evening, the Israel Defense Forces said the number of civilians captured by Hamas is ""unfortunately, a significant number."" Spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that ""it is unprecedented in our history that we have so many Israeli nationals in the hands of a terrorist organization."" ""These are numbers that we have never, ever seen before and these are, they're unprecedented, and they will force an unprecedented response from Israel,"" Conricus said. 'Situation is not looking good' Yoni Asher, a resident of Sharon region, told CNN's Erin Burnett he recognized his wife from a viral video that shows a group of people loaded on the back of a truck flanked by Hamas militants. Chants of ""Allahu Akbar,"" (God is Great), are heard throughout the video. The footage shows a woman in the back of the truck as a militant puts a scarf on her head. Asher told CNN that the woman is his wife and he's sharing the video to raise awareness of their situation. CNN has not been able to independently verify the video. Asher said his wife and young daughters were visiting his mother-in-law in Nir Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border. He said he suspected they may have been abducted. He tracked his wife's phone and learned that it was located in Gaza. Later that day, he saw the viral clip. ""I don't even know what the situation is regarding the hostages, and the situation is not looking good,"" he said. Hamas has not taken hostages in years. Until now, it was known to hold two civilians who crossed the border and were captured, as well as the bodies of two Israeli soldiers. Gilad Shalit, a 19-year-old soldier, was captured in 2006 and kept for five years before his release as part of a swap that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners freed. Videos of captives Other videos geolocated by CNN appear to show where Hamas appears to have taken other Israelis captive. In one of the videos, geolocated by CNN to the neighborhood of Shejaiya in Gaza, a barefoot woman is seen being pulled from the trunk of a Jeep by a gunman and then forced into the back seat of the car. Her face is bleeding, and her wrists appear to be cable-tied behind her back. The Jeep appears to have an IDF license plate, suggesting it may have been stolen and brought into Gaza. A second video, which appears to show Hamas militants taking multiple Israelis captive, was geolocated by CNN to Be'eri in southern Israel, a village close to Gaza. IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Daniel Hagari says Ofakim in the Negev and Beeri near the Gaza Strip are the ""main focal points"" where there are hostage situations.

The bill must pass further readings in parliament to become law, but so far appears to have broad support among Georgian lawmakers despite criticism domestically and abroad. Thousands of protesters could be seen outside the parliament building on Tuesday night, holding not just the Georgian flag but also European Union flags. Some threw stones and petrol bombs, as security forces responded with tear gas and water cannon. Video posted on social media also showed protesters storming a barricade at the entrance to the parliament building and tearing it down. There are fears the law could impede the country's hopes of closer ties with the European Union. The President of Georgia, Salome Zourabichvili, threw her support behind protesters, in a video message posted on Facebook, saying ""the path of European integration must be protected.

Police were forced to use proportional force to restore public order, the ministry said, according to Fist Channel. Protesters' chants, with insults aimed at both Georgian politicians and Russian President Vladimir Putin, underline fears that the bill follows the model of a controversial law in neighboring Russia that has already imposed draconian restrictions and requirements on organizations and individuals with foreign ties. President Zourabichvili called it ""an unnecessary law that did not come out of nowhere, but was dictated by Moscow,"" telling protesters that she was ""standing next to you because you are the very people who represent free Georgia today.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/18/china/blinken-wang-yi-munich-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with China's top diplomat Wang Yi on Saturday, in the first face-to-face between senior US and Chinese officials In a meeting on the Blinken, who a senior State Department official characterized as ""very direct and candid throughout,"" began the hourlong meeting by stating ""how unacceptable and irresponsible"" it was that China had flown the balloon into US airspace. The secretary later expressed disappointment that Beijing had not engaged in military-to-military dialogue when the Chinese balloon incident occurred, the senior official told reporters. ""He stated, candidly stated, our disappointment that in this recent period that our Chinese military counterparts had refused to pick up the phone. We think that's unfortunate. And that is not the way that our two sides ought to be conducting business,"" the official said. There was ""no formal agreement"" reached, however, on any kind of mechanism to increase dialogue between the two countries. The diplomatic fallout from the balloon incident has been swift, with Washington accusing China of overseeing an extensive international surveillance program. Beijing has denied those claims, and in turn accused the US, without providing evidence, of flying balloons over its airspace without permission. China maintains that its balloon, which US forces identified and then downed earlier this month, was a civilian research aircraft accidentally blown off course. Wang confirmed what he called an ""informal"" meeting with Blinken on Saturday and called on the US to repair the ""damage"" to the countries' relations, according to a press release broadcast by CGTN, which is a Chinese state media outlet. Earlier, Wang had criticized the United States' handling of the incident, calling the response ""absurd and hysterical"" and ""100% an abuse of the use of force."" The incident had an immediate impact on what had been seen as an opportunity for the US and China to stabilize relations. In early February, Blinken postponed an expected visit to Beijing, after the balloon - floating over the US in plain sight - dominated media headlines and public attention. The visit would have been the first to China by a US secretary of state since 2018, on the heels of a relatively amicable face-to-face between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in November. Biden said Thursday that he Blinken raised a possible conversation between Biden and Xi, according to the State Department official, who said US officials have not heard anything in recent days that would change the US assessment that the balloon was for Chinese surveillance. ""We haven't heard anything that provides any kind of a credible explanation for what this balloon was. The US stands firmly behind our assessment,"" the official said. Some analysts believed that Beijing, economically drained by its now-abandoned zero-Covid strategy, had been softening its tone on foreign affairs and upping its diplomacy with Western governments in a bid to win back lost ground. While expectations for substantial breakthroughs were low, Blinken's trip was supposed to build a floor for fraught US-China relations and prevent tensions from veering into open conflict - guardrails intended to keep incidents like the suspected surveillance balloon from escalating into a full-blown diplomatic crisis.  Any intelligence suggesting that the balloon's path into the US may have been unintentional could potentially ease tensions between the two nations. Visiting Russia Wang, who was named Xi's top foreign policy adviser last month, has already visited France and Italy this week and is expected to visit Russia after the Munich conference. The trip will be a test of Beijing's attempt to strike a diplomatic balancing act between boosting relations with the West and maintaining close ties with Moscow. Blinken and Wang on Saturday discussed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the US secretary of state warning ""about the implications and consequences"" if China increases its support for Russia's war effort, according to Price's readout of the meeting. The senior State Department official told reporters that Blinken ""was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion."" US officials familiar with the intelligence Those officials would not describe in detail what intelligence the US has seen suggesting a recent shift in China's posture, but said US officials have been concerned enough that they have shared the intelligence with allies and partners in Munich over the last several days. China's relationship with Europe has come under significant stress in the wake of the Ukraine war. Beijing has refused to condemn the invasion outright or support numerous measures against it at the United Nations. China has also continued to partner with the Russian military during large-scale exercises, while boosting its trade and fuel purchases from Moscow. According to China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wang's visit to Moscow will provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and ""exchange views"" on ""international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest"" - a catch-all phrase often used to allude to topics, including the war in Ukraine. The Foreign Ministry did not specify whether Wang would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""China is ready to take this visit as an opportunity and work with Russia to promote steady growth of bilateral relations in the direction identified by the two heads of state, defend the legitimate rights and interests of both sides, and play an active role for world peace,"" spokesman Wang Wenbin said. Wang's visit may also foreshadow a state visit by Xi to Moscow later this year. Putin extended an invitation to Xi during a customary end-of-year call between the two leaders, but China's Foreign Ministry has yet to confirm any plans. Blinken, who reiterated Saturday the US' unchanging policy regarding Taiwan and ""underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability"" with the democratically ruled island, reinforced statements from Biden that the US does not seek a conflict with China but will continue to ""stand up for our values."" ""The Secretary reiterated President Biden's statements that the United States will compete and will unapologetically stand up for our values and interests, but that we do not want conflict with the PRC and are not looking for a new Cold War,"" Price said in the statement. ""The Secretary underscored the importance of maintaining diplomatic dialogue and open lines of communication at all times.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/middleeast/us-mideast-allies-ukraine-war-mime-intl/index.html,"CNN At a major international defense exhibition in the United Arab Emirates this week, tucked away in a distant corner, a large purple structure featuring Russia's name has been erected far from the sight of most visitors. The biennial International Defence Exhibition (IDEX) in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi is the largest defense conference in the Middle East, with the participation of over 1,300 exhibitors from 65 countries. But what makes it stand out from other major arms fairs is its participants. Invitees include military officials and manufacturers from countries that aren't friendly with each other. Delegates from China and the United States, Russia and Ukraine, India and Pakistan, and Israel and Arab states are present at the same event. Eight Russian arms manufacturing firms were exhibiting at the fair, including Kalashnikov Group and Rosoboronexport. In a statement to CNN, IDEX said it was ""proud that this year's edition is the largest in the event's 30-year history."" Russia has participated in the exhibition before, but this year, its presence is particularly sensitive. One year since ""It has been clear since the start of the Russian invasion a year ago that America's regional partners in the Middle East... were not going to take sides or get involved in the great power competition and strategic rivalry that has taken on a harder edge since 2022,"" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a political scientist at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston, Texas. ""So, to that extent the US has failed in getting its regional partners to take sides,"" he said. Energy-rich Gulf states have benefited from the rise in prices brought by the war in Ukraine, which has added tens of billions of dollars to their coffers. All six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, registered budget surpluses in 2022 f In the UAE, the real estate market in Dubai boomed as Russians flocked into the regional business hub, buying property and starting businesses. Russians also became Turkey's top foreign buyers of real estate last year, according to the Turkish news outlet Daily Sabah, citing data by the Turkish Statistical Institute. Strategic ambiguity ""So far, it is very clear to them (Middle East states) a year after the isolation of Russia that picking sides would not be in their interest and so they still very much refuse to do so,"" said Cinzia Bianco, a research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Most Gulf states have remained ambiguous and ""cherish that strategic ambiguity,"" she said at an event hosted by the Gulf International Forum. They have been ""hedging since day one of the war,"" she added. But the US has indicated of late that its patience with its allies is running thin, saying the days of doing business with both Russia and the West are over. The Biden administration has been ramping up pressure on its Middle East partners to choose between Russia and the West, singling out the UAE and Turkey in particular. A US Treasury Department delegation Following the visit, After meeting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Ankara on Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that while his government On Tuesday, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo acknowledged that Russia's economic data ""We will force those that fail to implement our sanctions and export controls to choose between their economic ties with our coalition of countries - representing more than half of the world's GDP - or providing material support to Russia, an economy that is becoming more isolated every day,"" he said. Mohammed Baharoon, director of the Dubai Public Policy Research Center, known as B'huth, said that polarized language of West-versus-Russia is problematic and ""dangerous in the long run."" ""There's a new wall being erected, and I think this is the real problem,"" he told CNN, adding that increasing US pressure on Gulf states will not help Russia, the US or the UAE. ""Until now, the position of the UAE, the position of Saudi Arabia and others, has been to find a compromise, to find mediation efforts between the two countries to bring peace,"" he said. Ulrichsen of Rice University said that the UAE is likely watching American language on sanctions evasion closely in case it materializes into action. At the defense show in Abu Dhabi, the Russian stall was busy, with visitors in traditional Arab clothing seen taking interest in what the Russian arms industry had to offer. CNN approached delegations from three different Russian firms, as well as an organizer of the Russian pavilion, but all refused to speak. Rosoboronexport, a firm that makes drones and missiles, however, said in a ""Middle East countries are Russia's traditional and important partners,"" its director general, Alexander Mikheev, was cited as saying. The ECFR's Bianco, however, cast doubt over Middle Eastern interest in Russian weapons. ""It has become clear in several (Gulf) capitals that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exposed the lack of quality in the performance of Russian weapons, and the low levels of the Russian defense industry,"" she said, adding that Gulf states would now be even more reliant on NATO countries for defense procurement.   Two weeks after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake devastated parts of Turkey and Syria, a The epicenter was in the Defne district, according to the Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM. Ninety aftershocks followed, the largest of which was recorded at 5.8. At least six people were killed and hundreds left injured. The death toll in Syria and Turkey from the February 6 quake stands at 48,151 as of Tuesday. Here's the latest:   An Iranian foundation has praised the man who attacked novelist Salman Rushdie last year, leaving him severely injured, and said it will reward him with 1,000 square meters of agricultural land, Reuters cited Iran's state TV as saying through its Telegram channel on Tuesday. ""We sincerely thank the brave action of the young American who made Muslims happy by blinding one of Rushdie's eyes and disabling one of his hands,"" said Mohammad Esmail Zarei, secretary of the Foundation to Implement Imam Khomeini's Fatwas.  The United Nations Security Council issued a presidential statement on Monday expressing ""concern and dismay"" with the February 12 decision by Israel to legalize nine settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank. The statement avoided the language of a UAE-led draft resolution that would have reportedly called for the ceasing of settlement activity in the West Bank.  At least 10 Palestinians, including two Islamic Jihad commanders, were killed Wednesday in a major Israeli military operation in the West Bank that also left more than 100 injured, Palestinian officials said. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said those killed included a man who was 61 and another who was 72. The ministry added that 104 Palestinians were injured ""with live ammunition... six of them in critical condition.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/28/business/russia-economy-ukraine-six-months/index.html,"CNN Business Six months after invading Ukraine, Russia is bogged down in a war of attrition it didn't anticipate but it is having success on another front -- ""I'm driving through Moscow and the same traffic jams are there as before,"" says Andrey Nechaev, who was Russia's economy minister in the early 1990s. The readiness of China and India to snap up cheap Russian oil has helped, but Nechaev and other analysts say Russia's economy has started to decline and is likely facing a prolonged period of stagnation as a consequence of Western sanctions. On the surface, not much has changed, bar a few empty storefronts that once housed The exodus of Western businesses, and wave after wave of punishing Western sanctions targeting Russia's vital energy exports and its financial system, are having an impact, but not in the way many had expected. Nechaev, who presided over some of Russia's most turbulent economic times and helped steer its transition to a market economy, credits some of this to The ruble did crash to a record low to the US dollar earlier this year in the wake of the invasion as the West froze about half of Russia's $600 billion foreign currency reserves. But it's bounced back since to its strongest level against the US dollar since 2018. (Remember President Joe Biden's threat of reducing it to That's largely the result of aggressive capital controls and rate hikes back in the spring, much of which have now been reversed. Interest rates are now lower than before the war, and the central bank says inflation, which peaked at almost 18% in April, is slowing and will be between 12% and 15% for the full year. The central bank has also revised up its GDP forecast for the year, and now expects it to shrink by 4% to 6%. In April, the forecast was for an 8% to 10% contraction. The International Monetary Fund also now predicts a 6% contraction. It helped that the Kremlin had eight years to prepare, spurred by the sanctions the West imposed after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. ""The exit of Mastercard, Visa, it barely had an impact on domestic payments because the central bank had its own alternative system of payments,"" says Nechaev. Russia set up the Mir credit card, and its own transaction processing system in 2017. And there's a reason Russian fans of McDonalds and Starbucks are still able to get their fast-food fix, says Chris Weafer, founding partner of Macro Advisory Ltd, a consultancy advising multinational businesses in Russia and Eurasia. Since 2014, many Western brands in Russia caved to government pressure and localized some or all of their supply chains. So when these companies left, it was relatively easy for Russian buyers to buy them and keep running them simply by changing the wrapper and packaging. ""Same people, same products, same supply,"" says Weafer. It's not an entirely watertight strategy, though. The re-branded McDonald's stores reported a shortage of French fries in mid-July, when Russia's potato harvest fell short, and foreign suppliers wouldn't fill the gap due to sanctions. Can Russia's energy boom continue? Fast food continuity is one thing. Russia's longer term stability rests on its energy sector, still by far the biggest source of government revenues. To say high energy prices have so far insulated Russia would be an understatement. The International Energy Agency says Russia's revenues from selling oil and gas to Europe doubled between March and July this year, compared to an average of recent years. That's despite declining volumes. IEA data shows gas deliveries to Europe are down by about 75% over the past 12 months. Oil is a different matter. The IEA's March prediction that 3 million barrels a day of Russian oil would come off the market from April because of sanctions, or the threat of them, has not materialized. Exports have held up, though Rystad Energy analysts note a slight drop over the summer. The major factor has been Russia's ability to find new markets in Asia. According to Houmayoun Falakshali from commodities consultancy Kpler, most of Russia's seaborne oil exports have gone to Asia since the start of the war. In July, the share was 56%, compared to just 37% in July 2021. Between January and July this year, China increased its seaborne imports of heavily-discounted Russian Urals crude by 40%, compared to the same period last year, according to Kpler data. That's despite China's initial efforts What happens when Europe's embargo on 90% of Russian oil comes into force in December, will be critical.  An estimated 2 million barrels a day of Russian oil will be in limbo, and while it's likely some of that will go to Asia, experts doubt whether demand will be high enough to absorb it all. Falakshali says China cannot buy much more Russian oil than it already is, because of a domestic slowdown in demand, and because it simply doesn't need much more of the specific type of oil Russia exports. Price will play a critical role, too, in whether Russia can afford to keep discounting to secure new markets. ""A discount of 30% from $120 a barrel is one thing,"" Nechaev points out. ""A discount from $70 is another matter."" 'Slower burn' While global inflation is helping Russia's energy sector, it's hurting its people. Much like the rest of Europe, Russians are already suffering a cost of living crisis, made much worse by the war in Ukraine. Nechaev, who helped steer Russia through a much more dramatic economic collapse in the 1990s, is worried. ""In terms of the standard of living, if you measure it by real incomes, we have gone backwards by about 10 years,"" he says. The Russian government is spending to try to combat this. In May, it announced it would raise pensions and the minimum wage by 10%. It's set up a system where employees of companies that have ""suspended their activities"" can temporarily transfer to another employer without breaking their employment contract. And it's spending 17 billion rubles ($280 million) buying the bonds of Russian airlines, crippled by airspace bans and sanctions preventing maintenance and the supply of parts by foreign manufacturers. It's technology sanctions, like those affecting the airline industry that may have the most profound impact on Russia's long-term economic prospects. In June, US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo said global semiconductor exports to Russia had collapsed by 90% since the war started. That is crippling production of everything from cars to computers, and will, experts say, put it further behind in the global technology race. ""The impact of sanctions will be more a slower burn rather than a quick hit,"" says Weafer. ""Russia is now looking at potentially a long period of stagnation."" Nechaev is even more definitive. ""Right now, the economic decline has started,"" he says.",'Slower burn.' Russia dodges economic collapse but the decline has started

For most of my life, I tried to forget the horrific experiences my mother and I had during my early childhood. But it seems the past is repeating itself - and with a vengeance. When I was born, the Uyghur region - like the rest of China - was in the throes of Mao Zedong's Mao's zealots, called the While arbitrary reeducation on a large scale experienced a lull following the end of the Cultural Revolution, forced labor programs Now, some half a century later, China is targeting the Uyghur population with a new fervor.  According to the US Department of Defense, China Having experienced the reality of living under this regime, and now watching with horror as these atrocities are visited on my Uyghur brothers and sisters, it's difficult for me to comprehend how any Western actor could push for greater dialogue or engagement with such a regime.

I have not seen my mother or father for more than 17 years. The Chinese authorities have prevented my ailing and aging parents from leaving to reunite with their American children and grandchildren.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/15/economy/china-russia-closer-ties-sco-summit-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, When they last met, in February in Beijing during the Winter Olympics, they proclaimed their friendship had ""no limits."" Since then, Russia has sought ever closer ties with China as Europe and the United States responded to the invasion with wave after wave of sanctions. Beijing has carefully avoided violating Western sanctions or providing direct military support to Moscow. This balancing act, experts say, is a sign that Xi won't sacrifice China's economic interests to rescue Putin, who arrived at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan this week with his army retreating from large swathes of Ukrainian territory. But the trading relationship is booming, in a lopsided way, as Russia desperately seeks new markets and China -- an economy 10 times the size -- scrambles for cheap commodities. Trade in bilateral goods is at record levels as China snaps up oil and coal to Record trade China's spending on Russian goods soared 60% in August from a year ago, hitting $11.2 billion, according to Chinese customs statistics, surpassing Its shipments to Russia, meanwhile, jumped 26% to $8 billion in August, also accelerating from the previous month. For the first eight months of this year, total goods trade between China and Russia surged 31% to $117.2 billion. That's already 80% of last year's total -- which stood at a record $147 billion. ""Russia needs China more than China needs Russia,"" said Keith Krach, former Under Secretary of State for Economic growth, Energy and the Environment in the United States. ""As the war in Ukraine drags on, Putin's losing friends fast and increasingly becoming more and more dependent on China,"" he added. For China, Russia now accounts for 2.8% of its total trade volume, slightly higher than the 2.5% share at the end of last year. The European Union and United States have much bigger shares. China was But the world's second biggest economy has assumed much greater significance for Russia, which The Russian central bank stopped publishing detailed trade data when the war in Ukraine started. But Bruegel, a European economic think tank, ""China-Russia trade is booming because China is taking advantage of the Ukraine crisis to buy Russian energy at a discount and replace Western firms that have exited the market,"" said Neil Thomas, a senior analyst on China at Eurasia Group. Russia China's coal imports from Russia also hit Yuan the new dollar in Russia? The Ukraine war has also sent demand for the Chinese yuan soaring in Russia, as Western sanctions Yuan trade on the Moscow stock exchange amounted to 20% of the total trading volumes by major currencies in July, up from no more than 0.5% in January, according to Russian news media outlet Daily trading volumes in the yuan-ruble exchange rate also hit a new record last month, surpassing ruble-dollar According to Russian companies and banks are also increasingly turning to the yuan for international payments. Last week, Russia's Gazprom said it would For Beijing, it's a boost to its ambitions to make the yuan a global currency. ""Increased Russian use of the yuan also helps to inch forward China's long-term goals to make the redback a global currency, to insulate itself from Western financial sanctions, and to enhance its institutional power in international finance,"" said Thomas from Eurasia Group. For Russia, this partnership with China ""is born of desperation,"" said Krach. ""Because Russia has been severely weakened, in part by sanctions, Putin is willing to do a deal with a predatory power so long as it gains access to capital,"" he added. Chinese companies fill the vacuum Chinese companies are also taking advantage of the exodus of Western brands from Russia. Chinese smartphones accounted for two-thirds of all new sales in Russia between April and June, Xiaomi was the best-selling smartphone maker in Russia in July, holding 42% of the market, according to Russian media Samsung Chinese cars have also flooded Russia.

China is not providing military, commercial, or technological support that would ""risk significant US sanctions on China,"" said Thomas at Eurasia Group. ""Beijing will not sacrifice its own economic interests to support Moscow,"" he said. Fearing a US backlash, China has so far ""steadfastly"" refused to violate international sanctions against Russia, forcing Moscow to request military support from North Korea, said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Beijing's refusal to violate US and international sanctions reflects its begrudging acceptance that China remains reliant on Western capital and technology to sustain its ongoing development, even though Xi is personally inclined to assist Putin's war effort,"" he said. Moreover, China's rapid economic slowdown What the future holds Future relations will likely remained strained, ""There's always been mistrust between the two regimes, which historically treated each other as rivals,"" Krach noted.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/21/politics/president-biden-vladmir-putin-china-ukraine/index.html,"CNN President Joe Biden's trip to mark  But Putin issued his riposte in an annual address, framing the war in Ukraine as a wider existential battle against the West. After Biden vowed the US will be with Ukraine for as long as it takes, Putin's speech underlined just how long that may be, raising the possibility of more years of war that will stretch the commitment of Western governments and populations to the cause. China is meanwhile injecting its own strategic play into this widening great power brouhaha. It sent its top diplomat Wang Yi - his ears ringing with US warnings not to send Russia arms to use in Ukraine - to Moscow for high-level talks, even as a Sino-American spy balloon feud simmers. In the latest highly significant move in a week of diplomatic symbolism, Putin welcomed Wang and told him relations between Beijing and Moscow were ""reaching new milestones."" Wang told Putin that the two nations often face ""crisis and chaos, but there are always opportunities in a crisis and the latter could possibly turn into the former."" This week's developments do not mean that the future national security threats to the US from Beijing and Moscow are the same. The war in Ukraine has often exposed Russian weakness while worries about China's rising power will preoccupy Washington for much of this century. And the two US foes are not locked in a formal alliance against the US, even if both see ways that they can advance their own aspirations to harm American interests and power by working together. But this moment finds the United States negotiating worsening foreign policy crises at the same time - with its former Cold War adversaries in the Kremlin and its belligerent new superpower rival led by Xi Jinping. Both these rivals are openly challenging the international rule of law and rejecting norms that have underpinned the international system for decades. The idea of a global contest between democracies and autocracies And this new and complicated foreign policy picture is not just a problem for American diplomats. Rising challenges abroad as well, as the depletion of US and Western weapons stocks as arms are sent to Ukraine, pose questions about military capacity and whether current defense spending is sufficient. Key Republicans meanwhile are accusing Biden of snubbing voters facing economic and other problems, even as he tries to position Democrats as the protectors of working Americans as the 2024 campaign dawns. Putin and Biden go head-to-head In terms of presidential stagecraft, Biden overshadowed Putin this week, with his Biden often seemed to be talking directly to the Russian leader, trying to expose him to Russians, Europeans and Americans as a tyrant responsible for disastrous blunders and inhumanity in Ukraine a year after his invasion. He listed strategic consequences of the invasion that drew Kyiv closer to the West and strengthened NATO - exactly the opposite of Putin's war aims. He mocked the former KGB colonel over how his aggression has led to one Scandinavian state whose national sovereignty was once dominated by the Soviet Union but now wants to join the western alliance: ""He thought he'd get the Finlandization of NATO, instead he got the NATOization of Finland ... and Sweden."" And Biden vowed, ""President Putin's craven lust for land and power will fail, and the Ukrainian people's love for their country will prevail,"" he added. ""Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia."" That may be the case. But Putin made clear in his speech that there was no prospect of the war ending soon. In telling Russians the conflict was critical to their own nation's existence and part of an effort by the West to attack Russia, he set the stage for months more bloodshed and narrowed even further already distant avenues for some kind of face-saving exit if Russia does not prevail. ""I want to repeat: It was they who unleashed the war,"" Putin said. ""And we used and continue to use force to stop it."" To Western ears, Putin seems to be living in an alternative reality. And Biden contradicted his claims of Western imperialism, saying, ""I speak once more to the people of Russia. The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The West was not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today."" But dismissing Putin's conspiratorial claims and sense that the West is engaged in a long campaign to topple him would be a mistake. While conventional victory may be beyond Russia, Putin may be able to live with a long grinding war that inflicts devastation on more Ukrainian cities, kills more Ukrainians, ends up costing Western governments billions and gradually hikes pressures on leaders in the US and Europe to pull back. The Russian leader will likely be watching rising opposition to Biden's involvement in the war among conservatives in the US. On Monday, for instance, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis hinted - on the very day that Biden was standing with Ukrainians in Kyiv - that the future of Ukraine would not be priority should he win the White House. ""The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all that, and steamrolling, that has not even come close to happening,"" DeSantis said on Fox. ""I think they have shown themselves to be a third-rate military power."" Comments by DeSantis and other Republicans like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has warned against a ""blank check"" to Kyiv, show that while Biden can promise the US is with Kyiv for ""as long as it takes,"" he cannot guarantee it. The 2024 election may be as crucial for Ukraine as it is for the United States. An almost total shut down between Russia and the US Biden's trip also demonstrated that the estrangement between the US and Russia - a factor that will shape global politics for years - is almost complete.  Given that its economy is struggling, and its conventional forces are under extreme pressure, Russia also lacks resources to ignite a new nuclear arms race with Washington. But the collapse of one of the last building blocks of a post-Cold War thaw between Russia and the US exemplifies the almost total lack of communication between the rivals. The Biden administration's accusation last week that Russia has committed crimes against humanity ensures there will be no return to normality between Washington and Moscow even if the Ukraine war ends. Any time the top two nuclear powers are not talking is dangerous -- one reason why US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday Washington was willing to discuss the nuclear situation with Russia no matter what else was going on. Beijing ignores Washington's warnings over Ukraine war Even as it confronts Russia in Ukraine, the US is seeking to dampen its latest crisis with China - over what Washington says was a Chinese spy balloon that wafted over the continental US earlier this month. The two showdowns came closer to a linkage this week as the US warned China not to supply Russia with arms that it could use in the war in Ukraine and as Wang headed to Moscow. Russia and China agreed on a friendship with ""no limits"" before Russia's invasion last year, playing into long term US fears of a united front between Moscow and Beijing. The Chinese foreign ministry bristled that Washington, which has sent a stream of high-tech weaponry into Ukraine, was in no position to lecture China on the issue. Any effort by China to supply arms for the Ukraine war would not shift the strategic balance of the battlefield - but it would be a grave and hostile new front for the US-China rivalry. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that such a step would cross a US red line but did not specify what consequences could result. There is no public evidence yet that China, while offering rhetorical support for Russia over Ukraine, has supplied lethal arms for the conflict. And the idea of a formal alliance against Washington by Russia and China still seems unlikely - given the power imbalance between Beijing and Moscow in China's favor. China, which has its own economic problems, may be unwilling to risk US sanctions that could result from sending arms to Moscow. But Beijing may also have an interest in the war being prolonged in the belief that it could distract the US and its military resources from Biden's growing efforts to respond to China's dominance in Asia. A long-dragging conflict could also drive divides between the US and Europe - further playing into China's foreign policy goals.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/28/world/green-hydrogen-climate-explainer-blue-gray-intl-cmd/index.html,"CNN As the One potential form of clean energy is green hydrogen - which can be derived from sources like water, rather than fossil fuels, and is produced with renewable energy. It can be used to power heavy industry and fuel large vehicles, like planes and ships. Facilities to produce this cleaner form of the gas have popped up across the globe - in the United States, western Europe, China, Australia, Chile and South Africa, among other countries. The burgeoning global green hydrogen market is projected to be worth $11 trillion by 2050, by But critics of green hydrogen say using solar or wind energy to produce another fuel right now is a waste of precious renewables, as the world struggles to transition away from fossil fuels. At the same time, plans to use blue hydrogen - which is produced using fossil fuels - are coming under increasing scrutiny. Why do we need green hydrogen? A big part of the shift away from fossil fuel involves electrifying some of the everyday machines we use that are powered by oil and gas - cars and local transport, and heating for homes in some countries, for example. For those already electrified, like computers and home appliances, electricity from nuclear and But there are some industries that require so much energy that traditional renewables can't meet their demand. That's a problem, because those industries are among the top emitters of greenhouse gas. This is where experts say green hydrogen has huge potential. ""Electricity from sources such as wind, solar and nuclear is essential for decarbonising our energy system - but it cannot do it alone, and long-distance transport and heavy industries are home to the hardest emissions to reduce,"" said Uwe Remme, an energy analyst at the International Energy Agency. ""Hydrogen is versatile enough to fill some of these critical gaps - in providing vital feedstocks for the chemicals and steel industries or crucial ingredients for low-carbon fuels for planes and ships,"" Remme told CNN. Operating a plane or a large ship, for instance, requires so much energy that any battery used to store electricity from solar or wind would likely be too large and heavy for the vessel. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, can come in liquid form and is lighter. While liquid green hydrogen would emit zero carbon, it has some limitations. When burned in the open atmosphere it releases a small amount of nitrous oxide, which is a potent greenhouse gas. If the hydrogen is fed through a fuel cell, however, it Some small planes have Green, blue or gray? Hydrogen is Earth's most abundant element. It's found in many things, including fossil fuels, water, plants, animals and even humans, but it never appears naturally in pure form. That means to get pure hydrogen, it needs to be separated from other molecules through processes that also require energy.    So, which one is the best climate solution? It ultimately depends on the energy used to produce it. Gray hydrogen has long been seen as a cleaner ""bridging"" alternative as the world weans off coal and oil, but it's still a major contributor to climate change. Recent studies have also shown that gray hydrogen emits more greenhouse gas than energy experts initially thought. Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas and the main component of natural gas, often leaks from pipelines into the atmosphere. If green hydrogen generated from water and the electrolysis process to extract the hydrogen molecules is powered fully with energy from renewable sources like solar and wind, then green hydrogen could be a zero-emissions option. But it's not there yet. The machines used to carry out this electrolysis are costly and the process isn't particularly efficient. In 2020, of all the low-carbon hydrogen produced, 95% of it was blue, according to a recent report from the IEA. But by 2050, as the green-hydrogen industry develops, it should be more readily available, easier to produce and cost competitive with blue hydrogen by 2030, the IEA reports. By 2050, the share is projected to be 35% blue hydrogen and 62% green, providing governments and businesses are successful in developing the industry. Jess Cowell, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth Scotland, is opposed to any use of blue hydrogen, saying that it simply allows fossil fuel companies to stay in business and keep emitting. There may be a future for green hydrogen, Cowell said, but now is not the time to invest in it. ""You run the risk of diverting existing renewable capacity to green hydrogen generation, and right now, that's an incredibly inefficient process,"" Cowell told CNN. It doesn't make sense right now, Cowell explained, to use hydrogen for purposes like heating homes, which is being discussed in the United Kingdom as an option. If renewable electricity sources are being used to create hydrogen. ""So what we want to see is using that renewable electricity for direct electrification,"" Cowell said, explaining that the gas-fired boilers typically used to heat homes in Scotland and the UK more widely should be electrified and run on wind and solar energy, rather than hydrogen. Why is blue hydrogen controversial? Blue hydrogen has been controversial in many countries, including the UK, where the government The UK's chair of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association, Chris Jackson, resigned in mid-August after the plan was published, saying in a statement to CNN Jackson said in the statement that he appreciated that green hydrogen was not a silver bullet. ""Equally, I cannot ignore or make arguments for blue hydrogen being a viable and 'green' energy solution (a fact also validated by external studies),"" he said. One such study - which was published in Energy Science and Engineering in early August and has been peer reviewed - found that while blue hydrogen emitted 9-12% less carbon dioxide than gray hydrogen, it actually emitted more methane than natural gas itself. Overall, blue hydrogen's greenhouse gas footprint was 20% larger than burning natural gas or coal for heat, and 60% greater than burning diesel oil for heat, the study found. There are also some questions around whether storing carbon after it's captured, which usually involves injecting it into the ground, is sustainable. ""Our analysis assumes that captured carbon dioxide can be stored indefinitely, an optimistic and unproven assumption. Even if true though, the use of blue hydrogen appears difficult to justify on climate grounds,"" the study concludes. Remme, from the IEA, however, said that study made some assumptions that underestimated how much greenhouse gas could be captured, and that even if blue hydrogen were not as clean as the green type, it had a place in the world's transition away from fossil fuels. ""There is a role for both blue and green hydrogen, but we have to ensure that blue hydrogen is produced with the highest environmental standards,"" he said. ""The technologies are already available today to avoid these emissions, and they are often also cost-effective and save money.""",Green hydrogen could be the fuel of the future.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/20/business/russia-china-coal-trade-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business China is buying record amounts of cheap Russian coal, even as Western nations In April, not only did China's coal imports from Russia nearly doubled between March and April, reaching 4.42 million metric tons, according to trade data from Refinitiv. Russia has overtaken Australia as China's second biggest supplier since last year and now accounts for 19% of its coal imports, up from the 14% share it had in March. The booming coal trade boosts both sides. Despite bold pledges to China, the world's top buyer of coal, promised in 2020 to go carbon neutral by 2060. But after severe power shortages Coal imports soared 64% in 2021, and Last month, China First, there was a dip Coal trade between China and Russia declined shortly after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February and Western countries started hitting Russia with unprecedented sanctions. Chinese banks were initially reluctant to provide financing for purchases of Russian commodities, according to ""After Russia started the assault, Chinese and many other buyers initially scaled back purchases to assess the risk of secondary sanctions,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Helsinki-based think tank. By March, that reluctance had evaporated. ""When it became clear that the EU wasn't moving fast to ban imports, and that effectively prevented both the US and the EU from imposing broader sanctions that would affect other buyers, there was a jump in purchases resulting from latent demand,"" Myllyvirta said. The European Union has since Getting it cheap China is not only buying a lot of Russian coal now -- it is also buying it at a big discount. Russia is the world's third largest coal exporter and global prices of the commodity have surged since it invaded Ukraine. The price of ""In recent months, sanctions have created a stark bifurcation of the global seaborne coal market, as many importers are now unable or unwilling to import coal from Russia,"" said Toby Hassall, lead analyst for Coal Market Research at London Stock Exchange Group. As the pool of buyers gets smaller, those importers who are able and willing to buy coal from Russia are ""paying much lower prices for this supply compared with coal sourced from other origins,"" Hassall said. In April, premium Russian coking coal delivered to Jingtang port in northern China was priced at 2,710 yuan ($403) per metric ton, according to Chinese industry data provider MySteel. That compared with $475 for US coking coal reaching the port, and $423 for coal mined in China. The price discounts have persisted this month. By late last week, Russian coking coal at northern China ports averaged about $439 per metric ton, according to Hangzhou-based data provider Hithink Flush Information. Australian coal cost $512, and Chinese coal $496. To Beijing, buying more from Russia is not only a friendly gesture to Moscow, but also a smart move that benefits China's own economic needs. ""So far, the government seems to be ""This line does mean that China's imports from Russia are likely to grow simply on market basis, as other buyers move to embargo Russian fossil fuels,"" he said. Why does China need so much coal Despite the ""The Chinese government is currently pushing for all kinds of infrastructure and construction projects, which includes coal industry projects, to offset the effect of the real estate slump and Covid lockdowns on other parts of the economy,"" said Myllyvirta. China has been trying to boost coal production since last year, when On Thursday, Premier Li Keqiang said that a steady supply of power is critical for China's growth goals. China will ""resolutely"" prevent any power crunch from happening again this year, Li said during a visit to a power transmission center in Yunnan province, China. The National Energy Administration has set Chinese mines a target of 4.4 billion tons this year, up 300 million on last year's record output.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/07/middleeast/israel-hamas-rocket-attack-what-we-know-intl/index.html,"CNN The Israeli military has told all civilians in Gaza City Evacuating would involve moving more than 1.1 million people from the north to the south of the besieged enclave, amid constant airstrikes - a task that the United Nations says is dangerous and unfeasible. Israeli war planes have been pounding Gaza for a week, leveling entire neighborhoods, including schools and mosques. Israel says it strikes Hamas targets and that the group has used civilians as human shields. Israel's assault has killed at least 2,670 people in Gaza, and injured more than 9,600 others. Nearly 1 million Palestinians in Gaza have been forced from their homes, the UN has said. Here's what we know so far. What happened? Militants from Gaza fired thousands of rockets towards Israeli towns on October 7, before breaking through the heavily fortified border fence with Israel and sending militants deep into Israeli territory. There, Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 The attacks were unprecedented in tactics and scale as Israel has not faced its adversaries in street battles on its own territory since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. It has also never faced a terror attack of this magnitude that has taken the lives of so many civilians. While Hamas has kidnapped Israelis before, it has never before taken dozens of hostages at once, including children and the elderly. A senior Hamas official in Lebanon told a Russian state-backed channel that the group had been preparing for the attack for two years. Hamas called the operation ""Al-Aqsa Storm"" and said that it was a response to what it described as Israeli attacks on women, the desecration of the They said the bodies of some 1,500 Hamas fighters had been recovered inside Israel since Saturday's assault. How has Israel responded? In response to the attack, Israel has declared war and launched ""Operation Swords of Iron,"" striking what it says are Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza. It has also blocked supply lines of basic necessities to the Gaza population, including fuel and water. Between October 7 and 12, Israel dropped 6,000 bombs on the densely inhabited territory - that's equivalent to the total number of airstrikes on Gaza during the entire 2014 Gaza-Israel conflict, which lasted 50 days. Children make up ""between 30% and 40% of the wounded"" in Israel's airstrikes on Gaza, British-Palestinian surgeon Ghassan Abu-Sittah told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. The IDF has told civilians in Gaza to leave their residential areas immediately for their safety, but some say there is nowhere safe to go. All crossings out of Gaza have been shut. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said on Monday that he had ordered a ""complete siege"" on Gaza, blocking delivery of electricity, food, fuel and water. Energy Minister Israel Katz has said supplies will remain cut off until hostages being held by Hamas are freed. Israel on Wednesday formed an emergency government and war management cabinet. On Friday, Israel's military told the 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to evacuate their homes immediately. CNN has geolocated and authenticated five videos from the scene of a large explosion The videos show many dead bodies amid a scene of extensive destruction. Some of those bodies are on a flat-bed trailer that appears to have been used to carry people away from Gaza City. They include several children. There are also a number of badly burned and damaged cars. It's unclear what caused the widespread devastation; the explosion occurred on Salah al-Deen Street on Friday afternoon. IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN in an interview on Sunday that the Israeli military did not strike the convoy on Salah Al-Deen street. What's the situation in Gaza now? A humanitarian crisis in Gaza is rapidly spiraling amid warnings that peosple are at risk of starvation as Israel tightens its chokehold on the territory. The Gaza Strip is one of most densely populated places on earth, with some 2 million people crammed in 140-square-mile territory. The enclave lies on Egypt's western border and has been under blockade since Hamas seized control in 2007. The Israeli air, naval and land blockade on the territory, as well as the Egyptian land blockade, continue today. The enclave's only power station stopped working on Wednesday. Hospitals are expected to run out of fuel, leading to ""catastrophic"" conditions, the Palestinian Health Ministry warned. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that hospitals are at ""breaking point."" On Thursday, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned hospitals in Gaza ""risk turning into morgues"" as they lose power. Airstrikes have hit at least 88 education facilities and killed 12 UN personnel, according to the UN. The Palestine Red Crescent has warned of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" as there are ""no safe areas"" to evacuate civilians to, after Israel told half the population to migrate south. It described the Israeli evacuation call as ""shocking and beyond belief."" Human rights groups have meanwhile warned of possible war crimes being committed by Israel in Gaza. Amnesty International on Friday urged Israel to ""immediately"" lift its blockade on the enclave, saying the ""collective punishment"" of civilians for Hamas' terrorist atrocities amounts to a war crime. Since Israel shut its two crossings with Gaza, the only corridor through which Palestinians or aid can pass in and out of the territory is the Rafah Crossing, which connects the south of the enclave to Egypt. But it's unclear whether that crossing is open. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said on Saturday that the crossing is open but aerial bombardment has rendered the roads on the Gaza side ""inoperable."" Aid flights from Jordan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the World Health Organization, and the Red Cross have arrived in Egypt, but the supplies have not yet made it through the crossing. Shoukry said Egypt has tried to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza but has not received the proper authorization to do so. Hamas said on Friday that 13 Israeli hostages held in Gaza have been killed by ""random"" Israeli bombings on the enclave over the past 24 hours. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it could not confirm or deny the claim. Hamas also called on Gazans not to leave their homes, accusing Israel of engaging in ""psychological warfare"" by sending messages telling Palestinian civilians and employees of international organizations to evacuate to the south. ""Displacement and exile are not for us,"" Hamas said. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on Friday said it had relocated its central operations center and international staff in Gaza to the south of the besieged enclave. What is Hamas? Hamas is an The group, like most Palestinian factions and political parties, insists that Israel is an occupying power and that it is trying to liberate the Palestinian territories. It considers Israel an illegitimate state and has called for its downfall. Unlike some other Palestinian factions, Hamas refuses to engage with Israel. In 1993, it opposed the Oslo Accords, a peace pact between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that saw the PLO give up armed resistance against Israel in return for promises of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The Accords also established the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas presents itself as a It has over the years claimed many attacks on Israel and has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Israel. Israel accuses its archenemy Iran of backing the group. Hamas rules Gaza, the small strip of land bordering Israel and Egypt that has changed hands several times over the past 70 years. The vast majority of its population are How did the two sides get here? Tensions between Violence has been particularly acute this year. The number of Palestinians - militants and civilians - killed in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces since the year began is the highest in nearly two decades. The same is true of Israelis and foreigners - most of them civilians - killed in Palestinian attacks. Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas' control in 2007 after a brief civil war with Fatah, a rival Palestinian faction that is the backbone of the Palestinian Authority. After Hamas seized control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. Human Rights Watch has called the territory an ""open-air prison."" More than half of its population lives in poverty and is Hamas and Israel have fought several wars. Before Saturday's operation, the last war between the two was in 2021, which lasted for 11 days and killed at least 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel. Saturday's assault occurred 50 years almost to the day since the 1973 war, when Israel's Arab neighbors launched a surprise attack on Israel on What happens next? Israel is now on a war footing and has amassed more than 300,000 reservists along the Gaza border for a potential ground operation. It has said that it will exact a heavy price on Hamas for its attack and plans to retrieve Israeli hostages from the territory. Israel has dealt with hostage situations before, but never at this scale. In the past, militants have mostly demanded the release of prisoners held in Israeli jails in exchange for captured Israelis. In 2011, Israel traded 1,027 Palestinians for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and in 2004, it released more than two dozen Lebanese and Arab prisoners - including two senior Hezbollah officials - for Elhanan Tannenbaum, an Israeli businessman and army reserve colonel, as well as the bodies of three IDF soldiers. In 2008, Israel released five Palestinian prisoners, five Lebanese prisoners and returned the bodies of nearly 200 Arab fighters in exchange for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers. Hamas has captured at least 150 hostages. Their presence in Gaza will undoubtedly complicate any Israeli military operation there. The militant group's armed wing said Monday it would begin killing civilian hostages and broadcasting the act if Israel targets people in Gaza without warning. It isn't clear if it has acted on those threats yet. The IDF has said that it plans to take control of the Gaza Strip. Its spokesperson, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said the aim is to ""end the Gaza enclave"" and ""control the entire enclave."" When asked whether it had stopped the ""knock on the roof,"" which is the Israeli military's warning for civilians before it bombs a building. Hecht responded that Hamas did not ""knock on the roof."" ""When they came in and threw grenades at our ambulances they did not knock on the roof. This is war. The scale is different,"" Hecht said. Senior Hamas member Saleh al-Arouri told Al Jazeera Arabic on Saturday that Hamas is ready ""for all options, including a war and an escalation on all levels."" ""We are ready for the worst-case scenario, including a ground invasion, which will be the best for us to decide the ending of this battle,"" al-Arouri said. Could this lead to a wider regional conflict? Hamas' operation was carried out in a sophisticated and coordinated manner and would have taken a significant amount of planning. Speculation has been rife that the group may have received assistance from abroad, which, if proven, could raise the specter of a wider regional war. Israel says Iran supports Hamas to the tune of some $100 million dollars a year. The US State Department in 2021 said that the group receives funding, weapons, and training from Iran, as well as some funds that are raised in Gulf Arab countries. ""Of course Iran is in the picture,"" one US official told CNN. ""They've provided support for years to Hamas and Hezbollah.""A senior Biden administration official said on Saturday that it was too early to say whether Iran was directly involved in the attack, but that Washington will be tracking the matter ""very closely."" But President Joe Biden on Wednesday issued a stark warning to Iran to ""be careful"" around its actions in the region. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi spoke to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh by phone last Sunday and later congratulated the Palestinian people for their ""victory"" over Israel. On Monday, however, Iran's mission to the United Nations said the Islamic Republic was ""not involved in Palestine's response,"" referring to the Hamas attack. ""It is taken solely by Palestine itself,"" it said. On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said in Beirut that ""Lebanon's security is Iran's security,"" in an apparent warning to Israel not to strike Lebanon or the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group that operates there. He said that Western officials had asked him if new fronts could open against Israel, adding that it's ""probable"" that members of the ""resistance"" against Israel could enter the war ""with the continuation of Israeli war crimes."" The warning came a day after the Iran-allied Syrian regime said that Israel struck Damascus and Aleppo airports, rendering them non-operational. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has meanwhile been shuttling around the region, visiting Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jordan. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also arrived in Israel on Friday. The US has ordered t Israel may also face the threat of new fronts opening in the war. Of its immediate neighbors, it is only at peace with Jordan and Egypt, and is officially in a state of war with Lebanon and Syria. Israel has said it is ready in case there are attacks from those two countries. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has praised Hamas' attack and said it is in contact with Palestinian militant groups ""at home and abroad,"" its Al Manar channel said. The group claimed responsibility for targeting three Israeli sites in an area known as Shebaa Farms using missiles and artillery. The area is considered by Lebanon as Israeli-occupied. Israel responded by firing artillery. On Monday, the IDF said it killed a ""number of armed suspects"" who infiltrated into Israel from Lebanon and that soldiers were searching the area. Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati said on Monday that his country doesn't want to be drawn into the conflict. The IDF said Wednesday a report was received regarding a suspected ""infiltration from Lebanon into Israeli air space."" It did not provide further details and it was unclear whether the infiltration involved aircraft, drones, gliders, balloons or people.",Israel is at war with Hamas. Here's what to know
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/14/weather/greenland-ice-sheet/index.html,"CNN Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating. That's according ""The ice sheet is now in this new dynamic state, where even if we went back to a climate that was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago, we would still be pretty quickly losing mass,"" Ian Howat, co-author of the study and a professor at Ohio State University, said. Greenland's ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year, making it the greatest single contributor to global sea level rise, according to Michalea King, the lead author of the study and researcher at Ohio State University. The ice loss has been so massive in recent years, she said, that it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland. Ice melting in Greenland contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year, and that's likely to get worse. Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century, wiping away beaches and coastal properties. Coastal states like Florida, and low-lying island nations are particularly vulnerable. Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater. Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise. ""There's a lot of places, like in Florida especially, where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas,"" King said. ""And that's exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and things like that, that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline."" The study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts, leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels, making it difficult to prepare for the effects. The study used four decades of satellite data to measure changes in Greenland's ice sheet. The authors found that after 2000, the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water, even if climate change were reversed. Entire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change, Howat said, adding that all 200 glaciers that make up the Greenland ice sheet have been observed retreating within the same episode. Even though the retreat of the Greenland Ice sheet likely cannot be reversed, it's just the first in a series of tipping points. If climate change continues at this rate, the rate of melting will get much worse. ""We've passed the point of no return but there's obviously more to come,"" Howat said. ""Rather than being a single tipping point in which we've gone from a happy ice sheet to a rapidly collapsing ice sheet, it's more of a staircase where we've fallen off the first step but there's many more steps to go down into the pit.""","Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, according to new study"
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/07/middleeast/sirens-israel-rocket-attack-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the country was ""at war"" on Saturday, after Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a deadly barrage of rockets and sent gunmen into Israeli territory in a The Israeli military said about 2,200 rockets were launched from the Gaza Strip into Israel, while armed terror groups infiltrated into Israel by land, sea and air in paragliders. Multiple explosions were heard over Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and in southern Israel - some blasts likely the interceptions of incoming rockets - while air raids sent Israelis pouring into underground shelters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Hamas had taken ""hostages and prisoners of war"" but did not give a figure. At least 200 Israelis had been killed and 1,452 have been wounded, according to Israel's emergency rescue service and health ministry. Israel responded by launching strikes on what it called Hamas targets in Gaza. The Palestine Tower, a high-rise building which hosts residential apartments and media offices in Gaza City, was hit by an explosion and collapsed, video showed. The Palestinian health ministry said that 232 Palestinians had been killed and 1,697 injured, but did not say where the deaths occurred or whether the toll included Hamas militants or civilians in Gaza. Netanyahu has said operations are already under way to ""clear communities that have been infiltrated by terrorists"" and that he had also issued a call-up of reservists. He also vowed retribution against Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement that runs Gaza, in a televised speech: ""What happened today has never been seen in Israel, we will take mighty vengeance for this black day,"" Netanyahu said. ""I tell Hamas, you are responsible for the wellbeing of captives, Israel will settle the score with anyone who harms them,"" Netanyahu said, adding that Israel would turn Hamas-associated locations ""into islands of ruins."" ""Residents of Gaza: Leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere,"" he said. A fresh round of rockets was fired by Gaza militants on Saturday evening, making direct hits on multiple locations inside Israel, including in Tel Aviv, according to Israeli authorities. In a Telegram post, the armed wing of Hamas -- the militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, European Union and Israel -- said it had fired an additional 150 rockets in response to the bombing of the residential tower. 'The entire system failed' The surprise assault on Saturday was unprecedented in recent history in its scale and scope, falling on the 50th anniversary of the 1973 War in which Arab states blitzed Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. IDF spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht said in a briefing that Israeli forces ""are fighting on the ground as we speak,"" listing multiple locations where fighting was taking place, including several villages, army bases and border crossings. Hecht declined to answer repeated questions from journalists about whether the IDF had missed intelligence that the attack was coming. A former IDF international spokesperson, Jonathan Conricus, described the massive surprise attack as a ""Pearl Harbor type of moment"" for the country. ""The entire system failed. It's not just one component. It's the entire defense architecture that evidently failed to provide the necessary defense for Israeli civilians,"" he said. Dubbing the operation ""Al-Aqsa Storm,"" Hamas military commander Muhammad Al-Deif said in a recorded message that the group had ""targeted the enemy positions, airports and military positions with 5,000 rockets"" and that the assault on Israel was a response to attacks on women, the desecration of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the ongoing siege of Gaza. ""If you have a gun, get it out. This is the time to use it - get out with trucks, cars, axes, today the best and most honorable history starts,"" Al-Deif added. The attacks by Hamas follow one of the deadliest periods in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in nearly two decades. The violence has been driven by frequent Israeli military raids in Palestinian towns and cities, which Israel has said are a necessary response to a rising number of attacks by Palestinian militants on Israelis. They also come at a moment of deep division in Israel, months after the government pushed through a contentious plan to reduce the power of the country's courts, sparking a social and political crisis. The move this summer also struck a nerve with the military, prompting many reservists - the backbone of Israel's army - to warn they would not come if called up, to protest the changes to the judicial system. An IDF spokesperson said Saturday that he did not know of any reservists refusing to be called up in the face of the latest attacks. Israel responds to air, sea and ground assault It is rare for Palestinian militants to be able to make it into Israel from Gaza which is sealed off and heavily watched by Israel's military. As the day unfolded, the IDF said it was fighting in 22 locations, later adding that its operations has seen ""ground and aerial forces thwarted hundreds of terrorists in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip and southern Israel."" Another IDF spokesman, Brigadier General Daniel Hagari, said there were hostage situations in two locations - Ofakim and Beeri. It is not clear how many people Hamas has taken captive, however video verified by CNN showed the moment some were seized. In one of the videos, geolocated by CNN to the neighborhood of Shejaiya in Gaza, a barefoot woman is pulled from the trunk of a Jeep by a gunman and then forced into the backseat of the car. Her face is bleeding, and her wrists appear to be cable-tied behind her back. The jeep also appears to have an Israel Defense Forces license plate, suggesting it may have been stolen and brought into Gaza. A second video, which appears to show Hamas militants taking multiple Israelis captive, was geolocated by CNN to Be'eri in southern Israel, which is a village close to Gaza. Residents of Kibbutz Beeri and Kibbutz Nir Oz, two Israeli communities, told the country's Channel 12 television station that assailants from Gaza were trying to break into their homes. They have repeatedly pleaded on television for assistance from the IDF. One resident of Kibbutz Nir Oz told the broadcaster over the phone that his family, including two children ages 7 and 9, have barricaded themselves in a safe room while militants fired at the door.

Egypt controls Gaza's southern border crossing, Rafah. Israel has placed heavy restrictions on the freedom of civilian movement and controls the importation of basic goods into the narrow coastal strip. Video shared by Hamas' armed wing on Saturday showed a group of fighters storming Erez Crossing post, the main border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel. The video, which is heavily edited, showed several dead bodies on the ground with sounds of gunfire. It also shows what appears to be two men being dragged away with hands on heads by the fighters.

The equipment transfers are ""concerning,"" one of the US officials said, but at this stage, it's not clear to Washington whether the central government is aware of it. Although state-owned enterprises dominate China's economy, not all are subject to day-to-day oversight. Some US officials believe that the Chinese government knows about the equipment transfers and should take steps to upend them, the second official said. While the Biden administration is still weighing the impact and overall significance of the support, it is a matter of increasing concern among US officials. The US officials declined to offer details on the communications between the Biden administration and Beijing. Secretary of State Tony Blinken travels to China in the coming weeks, and the transfers are expected to be a topic of discussion, the second official said. CNN has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment.

Dating back to the very early days of the war, top aides to Such direct material aid from the Chinese government would also represent an apparent deepening of China's self-proclaimed partnership with Moscow, which up until now has appeared carefully calibrated. China and Russia publicly declared a The US believes that at the outset of the war, China intended to sell lethal weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, the US official said. But China significantly scaled back on those plans since then, this person said - something the Biden administration views as a victory. American intelligence officials have consistently said that they have not seen any evidence that China has provided lethal aid to Russia. ""It turns out that there actually are some limits to that partnership, at least in terms of President Xi's reluctance to supply the kind of military assistance to Putin that he's asked for in the course of the war in Ukraine,"" CIA director Bill Burns told PBS' Judy Woodruff in December. Still, China has avoided publicly criticizing Russia's war efforts and the two countries have repeatedly emphasized their partnership.

But the poll also suggested a growing awareness of the impacts of climate change, with 72% of respondents concerned that the climate crisis would personally harm them at some point during their lifetimes. In addition, 80% said they were willing to make personal sacrifices, or change their behavior, to address the crisis. Jacob Poushter, Pew's associate director of research and one of the authors of the report, said while concerns around climate had grown since the center's last survey in 2015, it was still a polarizing issue in some parts of the advanced world. ""We do have a trend, where there's a lot more people who are very concerned about the personal harm of climate change since 2015,"" Poushter told CNN. ""This is especially true in Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia and South Korea."" ""But there's pretty large ideological divides on a lot of these questions,"" he added. ""There's more polarization on this issue in the US, and to some extent Australia, than many of the other countries that we surveyed."" The US part of the poll was carried out in February, while respondents in the 16 other places took part between mid-March to nearly the end of May 2021. People were also surveyed in Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. That was before extreme weather events over the summer hit much of the Northern Hemisphere in heatwaves, wildfires, hurricanes and flash flooding. Though many respondents live in parts of the world where such events are becoming increasingly common. Who cares about climate? In terms of the personal impact of the climate crisis, Germany, the UK, Australia and South Korea showed the biggest increases in the number of respondents saying they were ""very concerned"" about the crisis, compared with 2015 polling. South Koreans were most concerned overall, when looking at respondents who were either ""somewhat"" or ""very"" concerned (88%), followed by Greece (87%), Spain (81%), Italy (80%), France (77%) and Germany (75%). In Sweden, only 44% said they were ""somewhat"" or ""very concerned,"" followed by the Netherlands (59%), the United States (60%) and Australia (64%). In the US, public views about the climate crisis did not change significantly when compared with the 2015 poll. In contrast, Japan was the only place that saw a significant drop, 8 percentage points less, in the number of respondents ""very concerned"" about climate change. The decline comes as the country recorded its Old vs. young; women vs. men Young adults were generally more concerned than their older counterparts about how warming temperatures would impact them personally, according to the poll. Sweden, home to the prominent The US, Canada, France, New Zealand, and Australia also saw a substantial age gap in public view about the rapidly warming planet. But over-65s in Greece and South Korea were more concerned than the younger age group. ""It's not new to us that younger people around the world are more concerned about climate change,"" said Poushter. ""It's the same when we asked the question of whether global climate change is a threat - and so that's really a consistent binding that we had."" Women were also more concerned about the personal impacts of climate change than men in the surveyed publics. In Germany, for instance, 82% of women compared to 69% of men expressed concern. Public views on climate change also fell along the political spectrum. Those on the left were more inclined to take personal steps to mitigate the crisis. The results ring particularly true in the US, where 94% of people who identify with the left are more likely to alter the way they live and work to save the planet. Eri Yamasumi, a specialist for climate strategies and policy at the UN Development Program, said the poll's findings chime with those of a similar but larger ""The Pew survey reaffirms the fact that people see a high personal threat from climate change - not only in the small island developing states, least developed countries and fragile contexts but also in many places in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific,"" Yamasumi, who was not involved with the Pew report, told CNN. ""Addressing the climate crisis requires big changes and it's important to understand how the public sees these changes,"" she added. Individual vs. collective action The report also revealed mixed views on having a larger, collective response to the crisis. Climate Many respondents were critical of how the US, which relies heavily on fossil fuels, has been handling the climate crisis. A median of 33% of respondents in the poll said the US was doing a ""somewhat good"" job, while only 3% said it was doing a ""very good"" job. Among US respondents, there is slightly more confidence, with 39% polled said the country is doing a ""somewhat good"" job, and 8% said it was doing ""very good"" job. Much like the US, China also received critical polling numbers, with 78% saying it was doing a ""very bad"" job dealing with global climate change. Over a month after the survey, deadly flooding from heavy rainfall ""Fewer are confident that the international community can deal with climate change, especially when it comes to views of the United States and China,"" Poushter told CNN. ""There's a lot of doubts that those two countries, which are the two largest emitters in the world, are actually doing a good job of dealing with the issue."" Unlike the US and China - which are the world's two largest economies and greenhouse gas emitters -  the European Union and the United Nations generally received more positive opinions over their action on climate. The results come as And since the polling happened before many climate change-fueled disasters this summer, Poushter said that public opinion may have shifted further in the time since the poll. He noted too that the Covid-19 pandemic had limited the scope of the survey. ""Unfortunately, this is only among sort of advanced economies where we know that telephone surveying works because of the pandemic,"" Poushter said. ""In a typical year, we would be going to those other countries and getting a broader view of how climate change and other issues are affecting people in the more developing and emerging economies of the world."" As people around the world become more exposed to the consequences of climate change, experts say public awareness about the impacts is necessary. The Deep and sustained cuts to emissions are needed over this decade to give the Earth a chance of containing average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, to avoid worsening climate change impacts and passing critical thresholds for many ecosystems. ""People are seeing the climate crisis in their own backyards,"" Yamasumi said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/12/australia/australia-climate-cop26-cmd-intl/index.html,"CNN If Australia's allies were worried that the country might cause them problems at Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday all but confirmed a report that his country had pressured the UK into And on Monday last week, when a senior UN official warned Australia's climate inaction would eventually ""wreak havoc"" on its economy, Australia's resources minister, Keith Pitt, Australia is becoming increasingly isolated from the rest of the world with its obstinate approach to the climate crisis. Leaders like US climate envoy John Kerry and COP26 President Alok Sharma have been focused recently on the ""Of all the developed countries, Australia has the poorest standing on climate. It's clear that Australia will just be absent, basically, from the talks,"" Bas Eickhout, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, told CNN. ""They were quite happy with the role the United States played until last year, and now of course they seem to be the last-man standing from the Western countries to block progress,"" he said, referring to the US' absence in global climate efforts during the Trump years. The UK has also come under criticism for bowing to Australia in the countries' bilateral trade agreement, in which an explicit reference to containing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius appears to have been taken off the table. But a British official close to the negotiations in the lead-up to COP26 said that the UK had otherwise been consistent in its messaging to the Australian government to take the crisis more seriously. Part of that messaging included denying Morrison a slot to speak at the Climate Ambition Summit in December last year, an event organized by the UK's COP26 presidency, the UN and France. More than 70 leaders attended and spoke, and many announced improved emission-cutting pledges, known as a Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Australia had no new NDC to announce, and it still doesn't, having missed a July 31 deadline mandated by the Paris Agreement. ""Last December, we had a little bit more run time, so we were holding the bar very, very high, and you really had to earn your stripes to be able to speak,"" the UK official said. ""They're a developed country, they've got huge amount of capacity, and they're being devastated by climate change, quite frankly, and we've been pretty strict on that. They haven't come forward with a long-term strategy."" There are growing concerns among some delegates that Australia could stifle progress at COP26 talks in key areas. Sharma, who is also a British MP, has said he wants the world to put an end date on coal at the conference and to push for countries to refocus their commitments to containing global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement obliged signatories to try to contain temperatures to 2 degrees, with a preference for closer to 1.5 degrees, but there has been a growing acceptance among many governments that the world should be aiming for 1.5. Scientists see 2 degrees as a critical threshold for many of the Earth's ecosystems. But the comments in the past week from Australia's leaders suggest they will push back on both coal and 1.5. ""We should increase the pressure on partners like Australia,"" Peter Liese, an EU member of Parliament from Germany, told CNN. He added he would be raising the ""challenge"" of Australia's climate inaction in the European Parliament as a problem. He also said the logic behind Australia's policy was difficult to understand. ""There's a general hesitancy in Australia to commit to ambitious climate targets, and that's quite embarrassing for that country because they suffer already from climate change."" Australia experienced devastating wildfires in 2019-20, events that scientists said were The recent UN state-of-the science climate report found that Australia trails China on net zero Australia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, from 2005 levels, a commitment that sits well below those made by the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, among other developed nations. US President Joe Biden, for example, increased his country's pledge in April to reduce emissions by 50% to 52% in the same time frame. The Australian Climate Council, which is independent of the government, has suggested the country should Instead of focusing on immediate emissions reductions, the government has framed its climate response around ""tech not taxes,"" saying essentially it will transition to renewables when it becomes cheaper to do so. ""Removing the green premium - the price difference between current technologies and low emissions solutions - is the key to widespread global adoption and will make net zero achievable for all countries,"" the Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources (DISER), which oversees climate policy, said in a statement to CNN on Monday. It reiterated its plans to continue to export coal to nations that are still developing, including China, India and South Korea. ""Australia has an important role to play in meeting that demand,"" it added. The Australian government in December last year technically ""updated"" its NDC, as it was obliged to do by the Paris Agreement before a July 31 deadline, but it did not actually increase its target to cut emissions. The point of the deadline was for countries to raise their climate ambitions. DISER told CNN it would release a long-term strategy on climate ahead of COP26.  ""Australia will spell out its position in due course,"" it said. The country's current pledges do not even put it on track to meet the requirements to keep global warming within 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5, The watchdog said that if the whole world followed Australia's policies, temperatures would rise by between 2 and 3 degrees. And while Australia says achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century would be preferable, it's one of the only developed nations that hasn't actually committed to it. Even China, widely seen as a roadblock to international climate progress, has pledged carbon neutrality by 2060. A spokesperson for the European Union told CNN that the bloc hoped ""Australia's ambition to reach net zero 'as soon as possible' can be turned into a 2050 net zero target."" Powerful fossil fuel lobbying Part of what's holding Australia back is the power that fossil fuel companies wield in the country. Australia is the world's second-biggest coal exporter, after Indonesia.  More than A shift to renewables in Australia has begun, but it's been slow. Just DISER said that there had been successful ""structural changes"" to the electricity sector, which has seen a reduction in emissions of 22.5% since it peaked in 2007. Meanwhile, as the UK, US and EU are designing ""green recoveries"" from the Covid-19 pandemic - boosting the use of renewables, like wind and solar energy, and setting targets to transition to electric cars - Australia's plans center on increasing its exploration and use of natural gas, a fossil fuel that contributes to climate change. It ""strategy"" for electric vehicles doesn't involve any subsidies or put an end date on combustion engine cars. A ""The direction that the Australian government is taking - for example its recent trade negotiations with the UK - isn't coming out of a vacuum,"" InfluenceMap director Ed Collins told CNN. ""When it comes to lobbying for Paris-aligned climate policy, corporate Australia is largely missing in action."" Collins said that Australia was a clear outlier from its peers in this dynamic. In the United States and Europe, for example, there are big companies actively pushing the government on climate policy. ""In Australia, that's not the case - it's missing those strategically engaged, pro-climate corporate voices."" It appears that lobbying fossil fuel companies have hijacked climate policy from the Australian people. Most Australians support more climate action from the government, The poll found that 78% of Australians would support a net zero emissions target for 2050. Around the same number support the government subsidizing electric vehicles. And 63% support a ban on new coal mines opening in Australia. Yet of the world's 176 new coal projects, 79 of them are in Australia, according to Fitch Solutions' Global Mines Database. The real lobbying to government for improved climate policy is left largely to activist groups. Lucy Manne, the CEO of 350.org, which is an international organization with an Australian presence, accused the Morrison government of deliberately slowing down climate progress. ""This is extremely frustrating, and the government will only see the movement calling for action grow,"" she said. ""The Morrison government risks Australia becoming not just a pariah state on the world stage, but also our economy falling behind. Australia has the potential to become a clean energy superpower and exporter, and the Australian public wants us to be a leader, not a laggard.""",Australia is shaping up to be the villain of COP26 climate talks

The administration announced a new $2.85 billion drawdown for Ukraine, part of more than $3 billion in new military assistance to Ukraine. The drawdown, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday, will include "" Blinken said the administration would work with Congress to ""to provide an additional $907 million of Foreign Military Financing under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022."" ""Funds will support Ukraine and countries impacted by Russia's war in Ukraine,"" Blinken said in a statement. California GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who served as House minority leader in the last session and is now pursuing the House speakership, But there's now concern that McCarthy's troubled bid for the speakership - a history-defying effort that has led to more than a dozen unsuccessful votes this week - could put further limitations on Ukraine aid. Two of the Republicans who had opposed McCarthy until Friday afternoon - Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and Texas Rep. Chip Roy - Several Republican members who switched their votes to support McCarthy on Friday said they are encouraged by a framework of an agreement, but provided no specifics about the deal and said talks are ongoing. For now, concern among Biden administration officials about the possibility of shrinking aid is somewhat tempered by the $45 billion in Ukraine assistance that Congress approved as part of its massive spending bill at the end of last year. That number was even higher than President Joe Biden requested - a reflection of Democrats' concern that additional funding wouldn't be as forthcoming in a GOP-led House. In some ways, that number was an insurance policy against Republican resistance and the view inside the White House was that that figure would sustain US support for several months. Administration officials are doubtful additional Ukraine aid will be passed this fiscal year. They believe the $45 billion will be the last major package of Ukraine aid before the current spending package expires on September 30. Rules changes to the budgetary process could significantly hamper Congress' ability to pass new aid come September and certain conservative Republicans have vowed to oppose any new Ukraine funding. There are also concerns among foreign diplomats about the implications the House speaker negotiations could have on the future of US support for Ukraine. One diplomat told CNN they believe the impasse ""definitely"" signals trouble for Ukraine aid moving forward, as many of those who have fought McCarthy's speakership have in the past spoken out against additional assistance for Kyiv. ""This is a harbinger for a protracted legislative paralysis,"" the diplomat said, adding that ""the Freedom Caucus - which is not particularly pro-Ukrainian - has just demonstrated its clout."" Others noted they were watching closely to see the kinds of maneuvers McCarthy would make to secure the role, which could potentially include cuts to aid. Another diplomat told CNN they're personally concerned about ""the policy concessions McCarthy has to make, and if they are going to affect US role in the world."" A third diplomat expressed concerns concessions like crucial committee assignments, such as the House Rules Committee, could be given to lawmakers who have advocated against more aid to Ukraine, which could create immense hurdles for passing additional assistance legislation. White House officials, before the current predicament on Capitol Hill, were skeptical that Ukraine aid would dry up completely. They have pointed out Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell is among the most ardent supporters of Ukraine, and note McCarthy has pledged continued support for Ukraine. Biden relayed in November that he did not believe Ukraine aid would dry up in a Republican Congress, saying that he ""would be surprised if leader McCarthy even has a majority of his Republican colleagues who say they're not going to fund the legitimate defensive needs of Ukraine."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday welcomed the latest drawdown, saying it was an ""awesome Christmas present for Ukraine!"" And lawmakers in Ukraine told CNN they are not concerned that the future of assistance is at risk, noting the strong past bipartisan and public support for aiding their country.

""Final pieces of debris are being transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory in Virginia for counterintelligence exploitation, as has occurred with the previous surface and subsurface debris recovered. U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels have departed the area. Air and maritime safety perimeters have been lifted,"" the statement added. NORTHCOM said in a statement later in the day that it would end the search for two of the three objects shot down over North America last weekend, stating that""the US military, federal agencies, and Canadian partners conducted systematic searches of each area using a variety of capabilities, including airborne imagery and sensors, surface sensors and inspections, and subsurface scans, and did not locate the debris."" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved the command's recommendation to call off the search. The Biden administration had repeatedly pointed to the need to locate and recover the downed objects to be able to identify what they were and who launched them, but US officials had grown less optimistic about recovering debris from them. The failed search efforts make it increasingly unlikely the public will receive a thorough explanation of what the objects were that US fighters had shot down over three consecutive days. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby suggested as much at a White House press briefing on Friday, telling reporters, ""We would like nothing better, but I can't sit here and promise you that we'll get to that level of fidelity of detail."" He noted the ""extremely bad winter weather"" up in the North of Alaska and ""arctic conditions"" were making recovery efforts extremely difficult. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Kirby said, have been unable to find the object downed in the Yukon territory and the Canadians have decided not to look for the object that fell into Lake Huron. ""So pretty tough conditions, going to be very difficult to find them, let alone once you find that debris be able to do the forensics to identify it.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/11/us/methane-climate-change/index.html,"CNN Slashing carbon dioxide emissions is critical to ending the climate crisis. But, for the first time, the According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the concentration of methane in the atmosphere is higher now than any time in at least 800,000 years. With Earth rapidly approaching the 1.5-degree-Celsius threshold above preindustrial levels, scientists say methane emissions need to be reduced fast. Charles Koven, a lead author of the IPCC report, said this is due to methane's incredible warming power. ""The fastest way that we might mitigate some of the climate change that we're seeing already in the short term is by reducing methane,"" Koven told CNN. ""If we were to reduce methane emissions, it would act to offset one of these sources of warming."" If the world stopped emitting carbon dioxide tomorrow, Koven said, global temperatures wouldn't begin to cool for many years because of how long the gas stays in the atmosphere. Reducing methane is the easiest knob to turn to change the path of global temperature in the next 10 years, he said. Methane, the main component of the natural gas we use to fuel our stoves and heat our homes, can be produced in nature by belching volcanoes and decomposing plant matter. But it is also pumped into the atmosphere in much larger amounts by landfills, livestock and the oil and gas industry. Natural gas has been hailed as But proponents for this new ""cleaner"" gas missed a dangerous threat: that it could leak, unburned, into the atmosphere and cause significant warming. Methane can leak from oil and natural gas wells, natural gas pipelines and the processing equipment itself. According to data from the  Until recently, tracking the location and magnitude of methane leaks was difficult. Now, infrared cameras and advanced satellites can estimate Climatologists at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ""For carbon dioxide, we've always known about power plants and smokestacks and things like that; but with methane, until recent years, we didn't understand how much an influence a small number of large sources have really had,"" Robert Jackson, professor of environmental science at Stanford University, told CNN. ""We didn't understand how long the tail was and how important the super-emitters were for reducing emissions."" The latest IPCC assessment highlights that scientists now have a better understanding of how much methane is being released by human activity like agriculture and the fossil fuel industry, and how much it contributes to the climate crisis. The sources of methane emissions vary by region. In North America, a majority - 41% of total methane emissions - come from the oil and gas production followed by livestock at 28%. In China, coal mining is the biggest methane driver, contributing 43% to its total emissions. Though agriculture is a major source of methane, Jackson said the emissions from farming and food production would be harder to tackle. ""There are only certain things we can do with cattle,"" Jackson said. ""We can either ask people to stop eating beef or we can try and give cattle feed additives to change the microbes in the chemistry of their guts. But that's not easy to do for billions of cattle around the world."" The Climate activists like Lisa DeVille, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, are urging policymakers to make stringent methane reductions. The Bakken oil field in North Dakota surrounds the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, where DeVille lives, with ""This means the land that is part of my identity as an Indigenous woman has been turned into a pollution-filled industrial zone,"" DeVille said. ""This is unacceptable."" As the co-founder of the grassroots group Fort Berthold Protectors of Water and Earth Rights, DeVille is tackling environmental regulations head-on. In 2018, the organization Global temperatures are now at 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the report, and the planet is already seeing the impact in the form of extreme fire behavior, severe flooding, relentless drought and deadly heat waves. The IPCC report makes clear that stopping methane emissions is key to slowing the planet from reaching 1.5 degrees. Scientists say world leaders need to act immediately in tackling all greenhouse gas emissions, and not just carbon dioxide. Rick Duke, senior director and White House liaison for John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy, told CNN in a press call that reducing methane, and methane leaks, is a top priority for the Biden administration. ""There's been incredible largely behind-the-scenes effort already to prepare to move faster and more comprehensively to cut methane domestically, at the same time that we're addressing this as a diplomatic imperative,"" Duke said. Already, pressure is mounting. In June, DeVille discussed tribal issues, particularly slashing methane emissions and transitioning to clean energy quickly and equitably, with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan. ""What we do in the next few years will determine what kind of world we have, what kind of world we leave for our children,"" said DeVille, who is now seeking to meet with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to discuss similar issues.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication was founded in 1973 to replace the telex and is now used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders. SWIFT doesn't move money around the world. What it does is allow banks to send each other instructions on how to transfer funds across borders. With no globally accepted alternative, it is essential plumbing for global finance. Disconnecting an entire country from SWIFT is considered the nuclear option of economic sanctions. But even limited action can have a big impact. Any bank disconnected from SWIFT will have a very difficult time sending money to other financial institutions, and its customers will struggle to conduct their business. Why only 'selected' banks? Removing every Russian bank from SWIFT would have a huge impact. ""The cutoff would terminate all international transactions, trigger currency volatility, and cause massive capital outflows,"" Maria Shagina, a visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, wrote in a paper last year for Carnegie Moscow Center. Excluding Russia from SWIFT would cause its economy to shrink by 5%, former finance minister Alexei Kudrin estimated in 2014, the last time the sanction was considered in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. But such a dramatic move would also hurt the West. The United States and Germany have the most to lose if Russia is entirely disconnected, because their banks use SWIFT most frequently to communicate with Russian banks, according to Shagina. Senior Russian lawmakers have said that shipments of oil, gas and metals to Europe would stop if the communication channel is disrupted. ""If Russia is disconnected from SWIFT, then we will not receive [foreign] currency, but buyers, European countries in the first place, will not receive our goods -- oil, gas, metals and other important components,"" Nikolai Zhuravlev, vice speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, said recently, according to state media outlet TASS. That helps explain why the West is moving to unplug only certain banks. How many banks are targeted -- and which ones -- will ultimately determine the economic impact of sanctions for both Russia and the countries it trades with. Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, said investors should watch to see whether Gazprombank is targeted since it handles a large share of Russia's energy exports. What does SWIFT say? SWIFT is based in Belgium and governed by a board consisting of 25 people, including Eddie Astanin, chairman of the management board at Russia's Central Counterparty Clearing Centre. It describes itself as a ""neutral utility,"" is incorporated under Belgian law and must comply with EU regulations. ""We are engaging with European authorities to understand the details of the entities that will be subject to the new measures and we are preparing to comply upon legal instruction,"" SWIFT said in a statement over the weekend. Has this ever happened before? There is precedent for removing a country from SWIFT. SWIFT unplugged Iranian banks in 2012 after they were sanctioned by the European Union over the country's nuclear program. Iran lost almost half of its oil export revenue and 30% of foreign trade following the disconnection, according to Shagina. Are there any alternatives to SWIFT? Russia has taken steps in recent years to blunt the trauma should sanctions include SWIFT. Moscow established its own payment system, SPFS, after it was hit by Western sanctions in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea. SPFS now has around 400 users, according to Russia's central bank. Twenty percent of domestic transfers are currently done through SPFS, according to Shagina, but the size of messages are limited and operations are limited to weekday hours. China's fledgling Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS, may provide another alternative to SWIFT. Moscow could also be forced to resort to using cryptocurrencies. But these are not appealing alternatives as neither system has a significant global presence.",What is SWIFT and how is it being used against Russia?

The Kremlin described the meeting as warm and constructive, and the leaders agreed to deepen their cooperation, according to an account published by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Russian oil giant Rosneft said it had agreed to boost supplies to China over the next decade. ""Working together, we can achieve stable economic growth ... and stand together against today's risks and challenges,"" Putin wrote in an Those risks may be formidable should Russia invade Ukraine. Moscow has denied that it has any intention of doing so. But US lawmakers are China -- which has its own tensions with the West -- has already expressed diplomatic support for its ally. ""Xi almost certainly believes there is a strategic interest in supporting Russia,"" said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He pointed out that China ""remains at permanent loggerheads"" with the United States. There is already some evidence that tensions with the West have deepened cooperation between China and Russia, according to Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and chair of Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at Carnegie Moscow Center. He cited arms deals, the joint development of weapons, and an ""increased number of joint drills"" between the two powers. But it's not clear how far that would extend to deeper economic cooperation in the face of harsh sanctions. Russia depends deeply on China for trade, but that's not the case the other way round. And the Chinese economy is already in a shaky spot, giving less incentive to Xi to tie his country's fortunes to Moscow's in the event of a military crisis. ""It would be a 'win' for Putin if Xi simply hews closely to China's stated desire for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, as it implies that Putin's grievances are legitimate,"" Singleton said. ""Beyond that though, China may be hard pressed to truly deepen its economic ties with Russia, at least any time soon."" Russia needs China for trade. China has other priorities China is Russia's No. 1 trading partner, accounting for 16% of the value of its foreign trade, according to CNN Business calculations based on 2020 figures from the ""Beijing needs to be very cautious about wading into a conflict between NATO and Russia over the Ukraine,"" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. ""China's current economic ties with Russia, including its energy needs, don't warrant Beijing risking further alienation and backlash from Washington and its allies. This could come back to haunt Beijing later."" Western authorities know the stakes are high for China, too. Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken China's economy is already struggling, which could make it harder for Beijing to deepen ties with Moscow -- or even deliver on promises it has already made, such as a  Singleton said that an escalating crisis in Ukraine would ""almost certainly shock"" energy and metals markets, thus weighing heavily on the global economy. That kind of emergency, coupled with China's strict zero-Covid policy, ""could hasten China's already rapid economic slowdown."" There are limits to Beijing's help A strong relationship with China would likely only mitigate rather than neutralize the impact of Western sanctions on Russia, according to Capri of the Hinrich Foundation. And there are some problems that China can't really help with at all, he added. Take the "" The Chinese yuan is ""nowhere close to being sufficiently internationalized to compete with the US dollar,"" Capri said, noting that the dollar plays a critical role in both SWIFT and also the trading of commodities such as oil and gas, the ""lifeblood of Russia's economy."" Analysts at Eurasia Group wrote in a report last week that Beijing could redouble efforts to build a yuan-denominated payment system, which might allow it to do business more freely with countries that have been sanctioned by the West without using dollars or euros. Even so, they wrote, companies in both China and Russia ""still prefer to denominate trade in freely convertible currencies,"" meaning that any efforts to reduce Western influence would be ""more aspirational than substantive."" Recent history isn't in Russia's favor. After Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, the country pivoted to China for support as it was slapped with economic sanctions. And even though Beijing publicly opposed those punishments and promised to Trade between Russia and China in 2015 fell 29% from the year before, according to And Russian bankers complained that Chinese banks were reluctant to do business with them so as to avoid violating the sanctions, according to a ""China is the senior partner in the bilateral relationship,"" wrote the Eurasia Group analysts in their recent report, pointing out that the economy is about nine times larger than Russia's.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/08/business/biden-uaw-electric-vehicles-climate/index.html,"CNN Business President Joe Biden wants to corner the market on electric vehicles. In August, But resistance to Biden's ambitious goal is coming from a surprising stakeholder: the United Autoworkers Union, one of Biden's oldest political allies. The union has long been wary about the shift to electric vehicles and its implication for jobs, with electric vehicles taking about 30% less labor to assemble than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, industry experts ""Our concerns were what that impact would be for our membership, what those products would actually look like, [and] potential volumes around those products,"" UAW President Ray Curry told CNN in August, adding his union wanted assurances from the administration that EVs coming from the Detroit automakers would be built by union workers. Making American cars greener is a key component of Biden's economic and climate agendas, and major US automakers are already planning for the inevitable future of electric vehicles. GM But the transition will be difficult; passenger vehicles contribute 29% It would be the most significant change for the industry since Henry Ford's moving assembly line, said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California Berkeley. ""Historically the union has embraced new technologies but has worked very hard to ensure workers can benefit from that,"" Shaiken told CNN. EVs are easier to make in large part because they have fewer components. Internal combustion vehicles and their powertrains -- the mechanics that convert gasoline to energy and propel the vehicles -- have far more individual components to assemble. EVs are powered by batteries and use energy more efficiently, according to a Climate change and the global impact of fossil fuel emissions are a secondary consideration for many union members compared to job security, Shaiken said. Workers may be more concerned about whether they can make enough money to feed their families and send their kids to college. There are tens of thousands of auto workers in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio involved in producing internal combustion engines, Wayne State University professor and UAW labor expert Marick Masters told CNN. With many fewer parts to electric vehicles and less labor required, there are natural questions about what impact the transition could have on jobs. ""There's also a level of concern with pay and benefits at these new companies, the new footprint of employment that would take place,"" Masters said, speaking about prominent EV companies like Tesla Forging a compromise between unions, auto makers and environmental groups in the lead-up to Biden's August announcement was ""hard,"" a source with knowledge of the conversations told CNN. ""It's been a bit of a struggle, and none of that should surprise any of us,"" the source said. ""The UAW has watched automakers writ large find creative ways, as markets shift, to avoid bargaining with unions."" To help ease the transition, the UAW is lobbying the White House and lawmakers to support consumer tax incentives for purchasing union-made EVs, a proposal included in the budget reconciliation bill currently making its way through Congress. An amendment from Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan would provide a base credit of $7,500 to help consumers purchase electric vehicles, an additional $2,500 credit for vehicles made in America and another $2,500 credit for vehicles made with union labor. Should that amendment pass via budget reconciliation, consumers buying American and union-made EVs could be eligible for a maximum tax credit of $12,500. ""With the EV consumer credit, the way we're writing it is to skew it in favor of domestically produced and union produced vehicles,"" Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan told CNN. ""If we don't get ahead of the EV production and consumer demand, we could see Americans buying EVs that are produced somewhere else. Our goal is to make sure we have American jobs."" The Biden administration supports the incentive, though that's no guarantee it will survive the intense negotiations taking shape in Washington this month. Two moderate Senate Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have already One Democratic lawmaker told CNN that for electric vehicles to take off in the US market, Congress is going to have to do more than pass better tax incentives; it will also need to pass funding for electric vehicle charging stations that would allow drivers to recharge their vehicles as easily as it would be to fill up their tanks with gasoline. ""What we're not doing is moving at the same place to develop a grid that would support it,"" said Rep. Gwen Moore of Michigan. ""That's where I would really like to see us step up."" With his 50% EV by 2030 goal, Biden signaled he wants the United States to ramp up production now. And although UAW president Curry says he's wary of getting ""locked into hardline percentage numbers"" for EV targets, union leaders realize the shift to electric is approaching quickly. ""It's coming, it's inevitable,"" said Bernie Ricke, the UAW Local 600 president. ""I don't think anyone can predict how fast it's coming, so from our perspective, our members want to be the ones that build them."" At the August announcement, Biden was surrounded by union officials and introduced by Ricke, whose Dearborn, Michigan, plant is responsible for producing the new Ricke told CNN there's concern from his members about how EVs could affect their jobs, and a strong desire to not only assemble the cars, but to manufacture batteries and other EV components as well. Union leaders told CNN they recognize an ally in Biden and have praised the president's pro-union rhetoric. For now, they are relying on Biden's and Congressional Democrats' word that they'll attempt to boost union-made cars with tax credits -- something that is far from guaranteed. Importantly, the union doesn't want to be left out of negotiations on the cars of the future. ""We're not going to sit on the sidelines and debate the issue; we are going to be part of the discussions,"" Curry said.",Biden wants an aggressive transition to electric vehicles.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/14/china/xi-putin-meeting-sco-summit-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN The last time Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin Amid a In a 5,000-word joint statement, the two leaders declared a ""The world is going through momentous changes,"" their joint statement said, noting the ""transformation of the global governance architecture and world order."" More than 200 days later, Xi and Putin are to meet again at a regional summit in the city of Samarkand in southeastern Uzbekistan. Much has changed, but not necessarily in ways China or Russia could have predicted. Three weeks after meeting Xi in Beijing - and just days after the Winter Olympics ended, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He had expected a quick victory, but seven months in, Russia is far from winning. Its forces are exhausted, demoralized, and fleeing territories they have occupied for months. And that is making China nervous. Having grown ever closer to Moscow under Xi, Beijing has a direct stake in the war's outcome. A defeated Russia will strengthen the West and become a less useful and reliable asset in China's great power rivalry with the US. A weakened Moscow might also be less of a distraction for the US, thereby enabling Washington to focus more squarely on Beijing. Xi has a fine line to tread. If he leans too much into helping Russia, he risks exposing China to Western sanctions and diplomatic blowback that would harm its own interests. The backlash would also come at a sensitive time for Xi, who is only weeks away from seeking a norm-breaking third term at the 20th Party Congress. So far, High stakes For Putin, invading Ukraine was likely a first step in removing Russia from the post-World War II - and post-Cold War - international order. A swift seizure of Ukraine would have dealt a painful blow to NATO, expanded Moscow's sphere of influence and significantly shifted the balance of power in Europe, in Russia's favor. A Russian victory might also have set a dangerous precedent in regards to China, which has vowed to ""unify"" with the self-governing democracy of Taiwan - by force if necessary. Under Xi, Beijing is already stepping up military activity around the island. An easy win for Putin would have further deepened Xi's belief the West is in decline, and provided a template for an attack on Taiwan - a hugely consequential event that could reset the global balance of power. But Ukraine fought back and instead of sabotaging the US-led order, the invasion has reinvigorated NATO, strengthened transatlantic ties and united the West. Putin's meeting with Xi, meanwhile, could not have come at a worse time. Russian forces are retreating en mass in the northeast of Ukraine, While it is still too early to predict the outcome, even the prospect of Russia losing the war is enough to make Beijing anxious. Russia's setback in Ukraine is already starting to draw While the growing ties between China and Russia are primarily driven by their tensions with the West, they are also partly propelled by the close personal relationship between Xi and Putin. During his decade in power, Xi has met Putin 38 times - more than twice as many times as he has met any other world leader. There is no guarantee a Russia without a strong Putin would be as keen to pursue a ""no-limits"" friendship with Beijing; in a worst-case scenario, it might even grow more friendly to the West, adding to long-running Chinese fears about geopolitical encirclement by the US. Self-interest calculation The question, then, becomes how far Beijing is willing to go to ensure Putin remains in control, and that Russia remains a powerful security and strategic partner to counterbalance America. For its part, China has abstained from voting against Russia at the United Nations. It has blamed NATO and the US for the war and decried Western sanctions on Moscow. It has also stepped up economic assistance to its neighbor, boosting bilateral trade to record levels. ""China is willing to give Russia some tacit support politically, diplomatically and to some extent economically, but the bottom line is that it isn't going to go out of its way and undercut its other strategic objectives to support Russia,"" said Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. So far, Beijing has carefully avoided actions that could violate Western sanctions, such as providing direct military aid to Moscow. Access to the global market is crucial for China, especially when its economy is already One area to watch, Hart said, is arms sales. China has long been one of Russia's largest purchasers of arms. ""I wonder if Russia's own defense industry is overstretched, would it turn to buy weapons from China,"" he said. But even then, China would likely seek to send spare parts or items not on the sanction list, or ship them via convoluted routes that are difficult to trace. ""(Beijing and Moscow) have said over and over again that they don't intend to create a formal alliance that binds them in ways that go against their interests. That didn't work for them during the Sino-Soviet alliance in the 1950s, and I think they really view that as a lesson of history,"" Hart said. ""I think China will only continue to strengthen relations with Russia, to the extent that it really is in their overall interests."" Growing unease But even before Russia's battlefield woes, its military aggression toward Ukraine - and Beijing's tacit support for Moscow - had already alienated some countries outside the Western orbit. When Xi and Putin Having watched Russian tanks roll into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, Central Asian leaders of former Soviet territories are worried that Russia could encroach on their land too. Kazakhstan, in particular, has refused to toe Moscow's line. It has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and its President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has publicly refused to recognize Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, enraging some Kremlin officials. China's refusal to condemn Russia has caused unease among Central Asian countries, said Niva Yau, a senior researcher at the OSCE Academy, a foreign policy think tank in Kyrgyzstan. ""China is at odds with countries in the region because it is still looking at Russia's war in Ukraine from this anti-West narrative - like it's about to bring down Western hegemony,"" she said. That risks hampering China's efforts to build stronger ties with its Central Asian neighbors, an endeavor China has invested heavily in for two decades, according to Yau. During Xi's state visit to Kazakhstan on Wednesday - his first foreign trip in nearly 1,000 days - the Chinese leader sought to allay such concerns. ""China will always support Kazakhstan in maintaining national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Xi told Tokayev, the Kazakh President, according to Chinese state media. An anti-West world order? Xi's trip to Central Asia isn't only about showing support for Putin, though. It is also about strengthening ties in China's periphery and reasserting Beijing's global influence. Founded by China in 2001 to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO was shrouded in relative obscurity for years. Under Xi, it expanded in size and profile, granting membership to India and Pakistan in 2017. After years on the waiting list as an observer, Iran is slated to become a full member at this summit, according to Chinese state media reports. Afghanistan is also an observer, and the Taliban - having taken over Kabul following a chaotic US withdrawal last year - is sending a delegation to Samarkand. But it is Iran that has set off most alarm bells in the West. Since 2019, Iran, Russia and China have held three joint naval drills amid deepening ties. Now, Iran's expected inclusion in the SCO is stoking fears long held by some observers that the grouping is emerging as an anti-West bloc. But some experts say in its current state, the SCO is not really the ideal platform for China and Russia to push that anti-West world order. As a multilateral organization, the SCO is a much weaker regional bloc compared to the European Union or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ""There has actually been some tension at times within the SCO. Russia has tried to advance some of its interests which aren't always aligned with China's in the region. I don't think it's perfectly set up to be this kind of platform for shaping a new world order,"" said Hart at the CSIS. Also complicating the picture is the presence of India, which has strong ties with Russia dating back to the Cold War. But Delhi has also seen relations with Beijing nosedive due to conflicts along their border, and has moved closer to Washington and its allies in the Indo-Pacific. India is a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue alongside the US, Japan and Australia, a grouping Nevertheless, Xi will use the SCO summit to show both the home crowd and the world that, despite being diplomatically isolated by the West, China still has friends and partners, and is ready to take on more leadership on the world stage. But if the war in Ukraine ends up being a major inflection point for Russia's weakening, it could deal a setback for Xi's plans. ""China doesn't really have any other large powerful partners in the way that the United States has many European and Indo-Pacific allies that it can rely on. So Russia is by far the most powerful state that is somewhat closely aligned with China,"" Hart said. ""I think that is something Beijing worries about - that Russia will overextend itself and it could undermine their collective efforts to shape the world order.""",Xi and Putin want to create a new world order.

Pitt's statement added that figures showing coal's ""impending death are greatly exaggerated and its future is assured well beyond 2030."" ""Coal consumption throughout Asia is forecast by the International Energy Agency to grow over the next decade to meet the energy demands of countries like China, India and South Korea,"" Pitt said. ""Australia has an important role to play in meeting that demand. Coal will continue to generate billions of dollars in royalties and taxes for state and federal governments, and directly employ over 50,000 Australians."" Australia is the second-largest exporter of coal in the world and the country has a high per capita carbon footprint, largely because of its coal industry. An Australian emits Of the world's 176 new coal projects, 79 of them are in Australia, according to Fitch Solutions' Global Mines Database. Pitt made his comments as the UN's top climate envoy, Selwin Hart, said the global phase-out of coal was not happening fast enough ""to avert a global climate catastrophe."" ""We fully understand the role that coal and other fossil fuels have played in Australia's economy, even if mining accounts for a small fraction -- around 2% -- of overall jobs,"" Hart said during a video address to the Crawford Leadership Forum at the Australian National University on Monday. ""But it's essential to have a broader, more honest and rational conversation about what is in Australia's interests, because the bottom line is clear: If the world does not rapidly phase out coal, climate change will wreak havoc right across the Australian economy, from agriculture to tourism, and right across the services sector. Similarly, construction, housing and the property sector, in a country where the vast majority live on or near a coastline. It will be even more catastrophic in your neighborhood."" Hart added that business and investors were increasingly abandoning coal in favor of renewable energy that is now cheaper in most places. By not cutting coal, Australia is setting itself up for a future of climate disasters such as droughts, heatwaves, fires and floods, which will become more frequent and severe as the planet warms. ""It is increasingly clear that decarbonization is inevitable, and it is the greatest commercial opportunity of our age,"" Hart said, adding that the world is ""at a critical juncture in the climate crisis."" Australia's climate record Coal is the biggest single source of carbon emissions in the world, and the UN has called on OECD countries, including Australia, to phase out the fossil fuel by 2030. China is the world's biggest consumer and producer of coal, accounting for around 50% of the world's production, and pressure is growing on the country to phase out the fossil fuel quicker than planned. Scientists say key economies must cut carbon pollution by 45% this decade if the world is to contain average global temperature rises to 1.5@C above pre-industrial levels. Going beyond that, scientists say, will mean more frequent and intense climate impacts, including droughts, heatwaves and wildfires, as well as heavy rainfall and floods. Australia has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2030, from 2005 levels, a pledge that sits well below renewed commitments by the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, among other developed nations. US President Joe Biden increased his country's pledge in April to reduce emissions by 50-52% in the same timeframe. Australia, like dozens of other countries, missed a July 31 deadline, laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, to increase its pledge, though the government says it will do so ahead of the COP26 international climate talks to be held in Glasgow in November. Australia has also not committed to net zero emissions by mid-century, a goal that the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, among other countries, have done. Net zero is where the amount of greenhouse gas emitted is no greater than the amount removed from the atmosphere. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said Australia is aiming to reach zero ""as soon as possible,"" and preferably by 2050, but has stopped shot of anything more concrete. Many Australian states have, however, committed to net zero independently of the central government. Much of the developed world is switching to renewable sources to generate electricity, while Australia's power grid remains heavily coal-reliant.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/09/business/australia-uk-trade-climate-intl/index.html,"CNN Business Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison all but admitted Thursday that his country had asked UK negotiators to exclude The UK government, which is chairing November's COP26 international climate talks, as well as Australia's have come under pressure CNN has not been able to verify the contents of the leaked email and UK officials have declined to confirm its authenticity, but when journalists in Canberra asked Morrison why Australia had asked for the temperature reference to be excluded, Morrison -- without confirming the Sky News story -- said Australia wanted to keep climate and trade issues separate. ""Well, it was about trade. It wasn't a climate agreement, it was a trade agreement. And ... in trade agreements, I deal with trade issues. In climate agreements, I deal with climate issues,"" he told a press conference Thursday, ""We're pursuing agreements on clean energy technology with a vast number of countries, and we'll have agreements about that. But the key agreement we've made is when we signed up to Paris, and the commitments that we made to achieve those. Those commitments are clear,"" he said. The reporting from Sky News suggested that the issue hinged on whether to explicitly mention a goal to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement obliges countries to try and contain the average global temperature rise to 2degC, with a preference for closer to 1.5degC. The UK's Department of International Trade had pushed back on Sky's reporting Wednesday, saying that it was ""completely untrue"" that the deal would not ""sign up to"" the commitments made in the Paris Agreement. ""Our ambitious trade deal with Australia will include a substantive article on climate change which reaffirms both parties' commitments to The Paris Agreement and achieving its goals, including limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. Any suggestion the deal won't sign up to these vital commitments is completely untrue,"" the statement said. But when asked specifically by CNN whether ""1.5degC"" would be included in the agreement, the department said it would not disclose the details of the negotiations. Kwarteng's office did not comment on the reports and directed CNN to the trade department's statement. Other free trade agreements signed by the United Kingdom, Morrison says 'Australia's doing it' on climate When asked about Australia's stance on lowering the warming limit to 1.5degC, Morrison only pointed to the Paris Agreement, which contains the 2degC target. ""We have signed up to our commitments under the Paris Agreement. We will meet them. We will beat them,"" he said. He added that while other countries were still making commitments, ""Australia's doing it. Australians are doing it. Australian businesses are doing it."" ""And that's the story that we can tell to the rest of the world. Australians, we just get on with it and we are."" The comments will be a new headache for COP26 President Alok Sharma, a British MP who is traveling the world trying to firm up commitments to 1.5degC ahead November's talks in Glasgow. He just finished a trip to China, during which he stressed the importance of signing up to the more ambitious limit. His office would not comment on the trade deal to CNN. A source told CNN during a recent G20 ministerial meeting that several fossil fuel producing countries were opposing the more ambitious limit to global warming. China has openly accused the West of trying to move the goal posts on the 2-degree target. Australia is the world's second-biggest exporter of coal and its resources minister, Keith Pitt, said last week it Sharma is also trying to get developed nations to end the use of unabated coal, which is coal burned without capturing the carbon emitted, by the end of the decade. A member of the UK's main opposition Labour Party -- Ed Miliband, who oversees trade in the political shadow opposition -- criticized the UK government for bowing to Australia's pressure on climate. ""Australia is one of the world's biggest polluters and key to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. But rather than piling pressure on them, the Government has simply rolled over,"" Morrison made his comments after the Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan said that The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which sent the statement The UK-Australia trade deal was agreed in principle in June. It was touted as a success by both sides and particularly by the UK government, which had sold the freedom to strike up bilateral trade deals as a key benefit for leaving the European Union. Australia is coming under increasing pressure to boost its climate commitments ahead of the talks in Glasgow. The country is among dozens that missed a July 31 deadline to improve its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement were obliged to do. The country has agreed to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030, from 2005 levels, well below the renewed commitments by the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, among other developed nations. The Australian government has said it will increase its pledge before talks in Glasgow. Australia has a population of around 25 million people, and it accounts for just over 1% of the world's carbon emissions. But per capita, Australians emit more than 15 metric tons of carbon, World Bank data shows, around the same as people in the United States, which is the world's second-biggest carbon emitter and responsible for more than 14% of emissions.",Australia's Scott Morrison doesn't deny pressuring UK to drop climate asks from trade deal

Energy demand is soaring worldwide as the global economy reopens. But supply isn't keeping up. Heavy rain and deadly accidents stir worry in China In China, power shortages are the result of a combination of factors, from China's post-pandemic construction boom, to its national push to reduce carbon emissions that led hundreds of coal mines to shut down or slash production earlier this year. Restrictions on coal from key supplier Australia and weather woes have exacerbated the issue -- and the latter issue has been acute this week, as heavy rains slammed Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, two key mining hubs that account for nearly half of the country's coal output. An incident involving a collapsed roof at a coal mine in Shaanxi's Xianyang city has made matters worse. The incident -- which killed four miners and seriously injured four others, according to state-run The price of thermal coal, which is primarily used to generate power, has continued to rise. Futures surged 11% Tuesday on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange to a new record of nearly 1,508 yuan ($234) per metric ton. That followed an 8% increase on Monday. ""We expect China's coal and power supply crunch to persist into the winter,"" Citi analysts wrote in a Tuesday research report, adding that the problem would The ""extremely abnormal"" weather forced 60 coal mines in Shanxi to shut down at the start of this month, according to an The National Reform and Development Commission -- China's top economic planner -- has tried to calm concerns about the unfolding problem, reiterating Tuesday that the government is going to allow coal-fired power producers to charge more for energy. Starting Friday, all industrial and commercial energy users will have to buy electricity at ""market-oriented"" prices, the agency said. Beijing has already made clear that power prices will be allowed to rise by as much as 20% from current base levels, or benchmark prices set by the government. Right now, the limit is 10%. Residents and the agricultural industry will not be affected, the agency said. Indian leaders warn of a potential 'power crisis' In India, meanwhile, state leaders are warning the central government about the risks of a coal shortage. Over the weekend, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Kejriwal called on the government to divert supplies of coal and gas to utilities supplying the capital, saying it was ""essential to maintain uninterrupted power in Delhi, which is catering to strategic and important installations of national importance."" The chief minister of southern Andhra Pradesh, Jagan Mohan Reddy, also recently told Modi that the situation was ""alarming."" Coal stocks at most of India's power plants have dropped to critically low levels. As many as 61 of the 135 coal-fired power plants in Asia's third largest economy have two days -- or less -- of coal supplies, India's Central Electricity Authority (CEA) said in a Sunday report. Coal stocks at 16 of them have been run down to zero, it added. But the Indian government has maintained that it has enough supplies to meet demand. The total fuel stock at coal-powered plants sits at about 7.2 million metric tons, which is sufficient for four days, the Ministry of Coal said in a Sunday statement. The agency added that government-owned mining giant Coal India has stock of more than 40 million metric tons. ""Any fear of disruption in power supply is entirely misplaced,"" the ministry said. Nonetheless, the situation in India ""remains precarious,"" analysts at ANZ Research wrote Tuesday.

The overnight The situation on the ground however remains tense. On Friday, a shooting in the occupied West Bank targeting a group of settlers as they drove killed two sisters and critically injured their mother in what Israeli police described it as a ""terror attack."" Hamas and Islamic Jihad praised what they called a ""heroic operation."" This year's violence takes place at sensitive time for both Israelis and Palestinians. Muslims have been marking the holy month of Ramadan, while Jews are celebrating Passover. The violence also took place as Israel grapples with the Here's how the situation developed, and why this year's violence is particularly a cause for concern: Who controls what in Jerusalem?  Al-Aqsa mosque and its surrounding complex are located in the Old City, in the eastern sector of Jerusalem, which most of the international community considers to be under Israeli occupation. Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967, and considers both East and West Jerusalem part of its ""eternal capital.""  Israeli police raids of al-Aqsa mosque are considered by Muslims as a major provocation, and have in the past led to violent escalation. Under the status quo, the Waqf, a Jordan-appointed body, is the custodian of the compound. But Israeli police control East Jerusalem, and Zonszein said Israeli raids of the compound have increased since the Second Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestinian Territories, told CNN that Israeli police have been raiding the area for many years, particularly during Ramadan, with varying frequency and intensity. What's different this time, she says, is that it occurs during a climate of record levels of violence between Israelis and Palestinians, and inflammatory rhetoric towards Palestinians by some of the Israeli government's far-right ministers. Why did the Israeli police raid al-Aqsa mosque? Calls for Muslims to stay in the mosque overnight increased after Jewish extremist groups had encouraged Jews to go up to the compound and sacrifice goats as part of ancient Passover ritual that is no longer practiced today. Israeli police said it stormed al-Aqsa Wednesday after ""hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators (had) barricaded themselves"" inside, adding that once they entered, stones and fireworks were thrown at them by ""agitators."" ""Their intention was to create a violent riot particularly against the Temple Mount visitors in the morning hours,"" a police spokesperson said on Thursday, referring to non-Muslims, who are allowed to visit but not perform prayers under the status-quo agreement. Some members of the current Israeli government have campaigned to allow Jewish prayer there. Videos shared on social media form early on Wednesday showed The raid caused outrage in Arab states and was criticized by Israel's allies, including the United States. While Israel's jurisdiction over East Jerusalem isn't recognized by international law, and the Waqf says Israeli security forces are forbidden from entering the al-Aqsa mosque compound under the status quo, Israel has repeatedly sought to prohibit overnight Muslim prayers at al-Aqsa. There is no explicit agreement restricting overnight worship at the mosque, but an Israeli police spokesperson Dean Elsdunne on Saturday told CNN that ""Muslims are not allowed to be in the compound during night hours."" Zonszein said Israel claims there are ""understandings (with the Jordanian custodians) on not staying overnight,"" adding that they haven't been made public and that Palestinians are unlikely to have agreed to them. It is customary for Muslims to perform overnight prayers at mosques during Ramadan, in a ritual known as ""itikaf."" ""Over the years it (itikaf) became yet another tool in conflict,"" Zonszein said. ""Israel started to restrict it when it found it to be a way for Palestinians to provoke friction with Jewish Israelis."" While it is customary to mainly do so in the last ten days of Ramadan, itikaf can be practiced at any time of the year and is not restricted to the holy month, said Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, Imam of al-Aqsa mosque and former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Israeli media has reported police will prohibit non-Muslims to access the compound during the last 10 days of Ramadan, in line with previous years. Following Wednesday's violence, the Waqf said that al-Aqsa mosque ""did not and will not close its doors"" to those performing itikaf prayers throughout Ramadan, at night or during the day. Sabri said that prayer timings are solely the prerogative of the Muslims authorities at the site. The UN's Francesca Albanese said that as per to the status quo agreement, the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, under Jordanian custodianship ""is the only recognized authority responsible for managing the site."" What happens next? Israel's strikes on both Gaza and Lebanon are thus far seen to be relatively restrained compared to its response in 2021 and previous years, which saw much more aggressive rocket salvos targeting Jerusalem. While security threats have traditionally unified Israelis and masked domestic divisions, some say too great an escalation could trigger the opposite effect for the Israeli government. ""The public is always supportive when these things begin, there is always a rallying around the flag phenomenon,"" said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security advisor in Israel and senior fellow at Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Israel, adding that while limited tension may divert attention away from the controversy over the judicial overhaul, any further escalation risks damaging Netanyahu's image, especially as it is taking place over the Passover holidays. Netanyahu's response comes not only amid domestic upheaval, but also amid ""The hope is that (the government) can de-escalate it, but I am not sure they will succeed,"" he said, adding that it may be in the interest of Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah -- both backed by Israel's longtime foe Iran -- to ""take advantage of Israel's disarray."" ""There is a potential for this to escalate further at a time when Israel is deeply divided domestically,"" he said. ",The situation in Jerusalem is boiling over. Here's how it all happened

""Through solid and steady steps, China will pursue an orderly phase-down of traditional energy in the course of finding reliable substitution in new energy.' Meanwhile, prices in China for thermal coal -- which is mainly used to generate electricity and provide heating -- have shot higher in recent days. Thermal coal futures surged nearly 7% on Wednesday to about 775 yuan ($122) per metric ton, according to the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. The contract has soared 13% so far this year. China expects its power consumption ""to continue its rapid growth in 2022,"" said Li Yunqing, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission, at a press conference on Tuesday in Beijing.

""The intelligence community's current assessment is that these three objects were most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions studying weather or conducting other scientific research."" Biden's White House speech to address the matter four days after the last known object was shot down comes after the president faced increasing pressure in Washington to be more transparent about the situation and his decision making as commander-in-chief. Biden emphasized that there hasn't been evidence to suggest ""a sudden increase in the number of objects in the sky."" And although the most recent three objects appear to have been benign, Biden warned, ""If any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people, I will take it down."" The president said he has directed his team to devise ""sharper rules for how we will deal with these unidentified objects moving forward, distinguishing between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not."" Those classified parameters will be shared with Congress when they are finished. The president also said he's directing national security adviser Jake Sullivan to lead a ""government-wide effort"" for how to address future encounters with similar high-altitude objects.

""The US side overreacted and shot down the Chinese civilian uncrewed airship with excessive force, disregarding international laws and practices.""

It's anticipated that new protocols on how the US will handle similar unidentified objects going forward will be released this week. Earlier this week, Canadian officials were candid about the difficult task of recovering debris from high-altitude objects shot down over Canada and the US, admitting it could still take days or weeks and there is no guarantee the debris will be found.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have criticized Biden for not approving the military to down the first balloon quickly enough, letting it sail eastward for days. They had also called on him to speak on the matter. But administration officials argued that the US didn't move earlier to shoot down the balloon in part over fears it could provoke an escalation of military tensions with China. They also told lawmakers the balloon was not first shot down when it entered Alaskan airspace because the waters there are cold and deep, making it less likely they could have recovered the balloon. And officials had been wary of having the president speak publicly about the objects until more information was gathered about the three unidentified objects that were downed last weekend. ""He believed it was important to explain what we had learned,"" a senior administration official said, adding the president wanted to ""put into context"" the new rules and the administration's plans going forward for dealing with the unidentified objects. Biden on Thursday justified the decision to wait to shoot the Chinese balloon, saying he gave the green light for the US military to take it down ""as soon as it was safe to do so."" ""The military advised against shooting it down over land because of the sheer size of it. It was the size of multiple school buses and it posed a risk to people on the ground if it was shot down where people lived,"" he said. ""Instead, we tracked it closely, we analyzed its capabilities and we learned more about how it operates. Because we knew its path, we were able to protect sensitive sites against collection. We waited until it was safely over water, which would not only protect civilians, but also enable us to recover substantial components for further analytics.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/26/investing/swift-russia-ukraine/index.html,"CNN Business Some are calling it the ""nuclear option."" As US lawmakers have suggested in recent weeks that Russia could be removed from SWIFT, a high security network that connect thousands of financial institutions around the world. Senior Russian lawmakers have responded by saying that shipments of oil, gas and metals to Europe would stop if that happened. ""If Russia is disconnected from SWIFT, then we will not receive [foreign] currency, but buyers, European countries in the first place, will not receive our goods -- oil, gas, metals and other important components,"" Nikolai Zhuravlev, vice speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, said Tuesday, according to state media outlet TASS. What is SWIFT? The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication was founded in 1973 to replace the telex and is now used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders. With no globally accepted alternative, it is essential plumbing for global finance. Removing Russia from SWIFT would make it nearly impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of the country, delivering a sudden shock to Russian companies and their foreign customers -- especially buyers of oil and gas exports denominated in US dollars. ""The cutoff would terminate all international transactions, trigger currency volatility, and cause massive capital outflows,"" Maria Shagina, a visiting fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, SWIFT is based in Belgium and governed by a board consisting of 25 people, including Eddie Astanin, chairman of the management board at Russia's Central Counterparty Clearing Centre. SWIFT, which describes itself as a ""neutral utility,"" is incorporated under Belgian law and must comply with EU regulations. What happens if Russia is removed? There is precedent for removing a country from SWIFT. SWIFT unplugged Iranian banks in 2012 after they were sanctioned by the European Union over the country's nuclear program. Iran lost almost half of its oil export revenue and 30% of foreign trade following the disconnection, according to Shagina. ""SWIFT is a neutral global cooperative set up and operated for the collective benefit of its community,"" the organization said in a statement Wednesday. ""Any decision to impose sanctions on countries or individual entities rests solely with the competent government bodies and applicable legislators,"" it added. It's not clear how much support there is among US allies for taking similar action against Russia. The United States and Germany have the most to lose if Russia is disconnected, because their banks are the most frequent SWIFT users to communicate with Russian banks, according to Shagina. The European Central Bank has warned lenders with significant exposure to Russia to prepare for sanctions against Moscow, according to the The European Union is ready to respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine with ""comprehensive sanctions never seen before,"" Danish foreign minister Jeppe Kofod said on Monday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told lawmakers on Tuesday that his government was discussing the possibility of banning Russia from SWIFT with the United States. ""There is no doubt that that would be a very potent weapon [against Russia]. I'm afraid it can only really be deployed with the assistance of the United States though. We are in discussions about that,"" Johnson said. Russia's countermeasures Russia has taken steps in recent years to blunt the trauma should it be removed from SWIFT. Moscow established its own payment system, SPFS, after it was hit by Western sanctions in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea early that year. SPFS now has around 400 users, according to Russia's central bank. Twenty percent of domestic transfers are currently done through SPFS, according to Shagina, but the size of messages are limited and operations are limited to weekday hours. China's fledgling Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, or CIPS, may provide another alternative to SWIFT. Moscow could also be forced to resort to using cryptocurrencies. But these are not appealing alternatives. ""SWIFT is an European company, an association of many participating countries. To make a decision on disconnection, a united decision of all participating countries is needed. The decisions of the United States and Great Britain are definitely not enough,"" Zhuravlev said, according to TASS. ""I'm not sure that other countries, especially those whose share of trade with Russia is large in balance, will support the shutdown,"" he added.",What is SWIFT and why it might be the weapon Russia fears most

Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported ""massive shelling and bombing"" of the central part of Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, on Wednesday morning. In other developments: On Wednesday night, CNN teams on the ground heard air raid sirens in Ukraine's third-largest city Odessa and the town of Uman, Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the capital of Kyiv, a major heating pipeline was damaged as a result of a missile strike to the area of the Central Railway station in the evening, the country's interior ministry said. The sound of the blast could be heard across the city, according to a CNN team, though the target of the strike was not clear. Kyiv's mayor Vitaly Klitschko said preliminary reports suggested there were no casualties in a blast, adding: ""We are clarifying the details."" Klitschko said in a Telegram post that despite shelling in a number of Kyiv suburbs Wednesday, ""Thank God, there are no casualties."" ""The enemy was trying to breakthrough to our city, but Ukrainian defenders are repulsing the occupiers and defending our capital."" It's unclear what caused the blast near the station. An Interior Ministry adviser said the damage was caused by the falling wreckage of a cruise missile after it had been intercepted by Ukrainian air defense systems. Kherson mayor indicates city has fallen The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said that the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" - indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control. The announcement on the mayor's Facebook page late Wednesday follows several days of pressure on Kherson by Russian forces who had surrounded the city. Kherson City Council said earlier in the day that least 36 people had been killed in an ongoing battle for control of the area. Kherson is a strategically important city on an inlet from the Black Sea with a population of nearly 300,000. If Kherson is now under Russian control, it would be a significant turning point for the invading military - the first major city seized. Earlier Wednesday, Ukraine disputed Russian claims of control saying Ukrainians forces were still fighting in parts of the city. The new post said Ukrainian forces had left. The mayor also told the New York Times in an interview that a group of about 10 armed Russian officers, including the commander of forces attacking the city, entered the city hall building Wednesday. He said he was informed by the Russian officers that they were planning to set up a new administration similar to those in two Russian-backed separatist statelets in eastern Ukraine, according to the NY Times interview. Late Wednesday, Hennady Lahuta, the head of Kherson regional administration, issued a message saying: ""I ask everyone who is not at home now, or who is planning to go outside, not to do so. The occupiers are in all areas of the city and are very dangerous."" Mayor Kolykhaiev did not explicitly say that the Russians controlled the city, but that ""there were armed visitors in the city executive committee today."" Strikes in Kharkiv In Kharkiv, a Wednesday morning strike on the regional police department and Kharkiv National University left the buildings engulfed by fire, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service and videos geolocated by CNN. Four people were killed and nine injured, the State Emergency Service said Wednesday, while rescuers pulled 10 people from the rubble. New videos posted to social media early Wednesday and verified by CNN showed badly damaged buildings in western Kharkiv in an area with markets, stores and residential buildings. In Kharkiv's northern neighborhood of Saltivka, a school was the latest site of Russian military strikes on Wednesday, according to a video and photo posted to social media. CNN The school has been the site of repeated strikes in recent days. Video from the scene shows a large hole in the wall of a school, rubble strewn across a courtyard and broken glass.

It's unclear how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war. The UN on Tuesday reported at least 136 civilian deaths since Russia's invasion started, but cautioned the toll is likely ""much higher."" CNN could not independently verify this figure. Earlier today, Ukraine's State Emergency Service issued a statement claiming more than 2,000 civilians had been killed, before removing it. The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure. While the US and NATO allies have aided Ukraine by sharing arms, military equipment and intelligence, as well as imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia, the alliance has thus far made clear it has no plans to send soldiers into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, which is not a ""I've spoken to Biden many times,"" Zelensky told CNN. ""And I've told them many times that Ukraine will resist and fight stronger than anyone else but on our own against Russia we won't manage it."" Onslaught in Ukraine As Russia continued to strike key cities on Wednesday, the humanitarian cost of the invasion is steadily increasing. The International Criminal Court said on Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement that 39 of the court's member states had requested for the investigation to proceed. ""Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,"" Khan said, noting the investigation will cover incidents in Ukraine from 2013 to the present. Khan said his office ""had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible."" Meanwhile, the number of people fleeing the country continues to rise. The UN said Wednesday it had recorded the arrival of 835,928 refugees from Ukraine since the invasion began on February 24. Of those, more than 450,000 have entered Poland. ""We are looking at what could become Europe's largest refugee crisis this century,"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said a day earlier. The UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia's overall gains had been limited in the past 24 hours, adding this was probably due to ""ongoing logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance."" Russia has continued to target built-up areas with air strikes and heavy artillery, it added, focusing mainly on Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv. Russian forces moving towards Kyiv in the northern part of Ukraine, including a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, ""remain stalled,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a Wednesday briefing. ""They haven't from our best estimates made any appreciable progress in the last 24-36 hours,"" Kirby said of the Russian forces moving towards Kyiv. ""Nothing very significant."" Kirby said the stall is likely due to a number of factors including Russian forces deliberately ""regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time,"" ""logistics and sustainment challenges,"" and ""resistance from the Ukrainians,"" Kirby said. In Kyiv, sick children Russian forces also fired rockets that hit near a TV tower. In a statement Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry acknowledged carrying out long-range strikes on communications infrastructure in Ukraine. Russian and Ukrainian delegations were set to meet later Wednesday for a new round of talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a call with foreign journalists. He gave no details about the location or format of the discussions. Peskov also acknowledged in the call that the Russian economy was taking ""serious blows"" as a result of sanctions imposed by the West, but said there was a ""certain margin of safety"" and that the economy ""will stay on its feet."" A Ukrainian presidential aide told CNN the two delegations were expected to comprise the same representatives as in the first round of talks on Monday, held in Belarus near the Ukrainian border. The two sides discussed a potential ceasefire, according to a Ukrainian presidential adviser, but no concrete result emerged. In a Facebook post published Wednesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia's claims were unchanged during Monday's talks. ""We are ready for talks, we are ready for diplomacy, but we are not in any way ready to accept any Russian ultimatums,"" he added. Meanwhile, the international community is stepping up pressure on Putin, leaving Russia increasingly isolated. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday that the UK would ""continue to tighten the noose around Putin's regime,"" adding that its use of munitions in civilian areas ""in my view already fully qualifies as a war crime."" French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe has been ""shaken"" by the war in Ukraine in an address to the nation on Wednesday. ""Our continent, like many aspects of our daily lives, has been shaken by this war and will experience great changes in the months that come,"" Macron said. ""Hundreds and thousands of refugees have been and will be welcomed on the continent of Europe,"" he said, adding that France will ""play its role"" in making sure that the children of Ukrainians who stay in the country to fight will be looked after. Zelensky has urged the international community to do more, calling on the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine or put boots on the ground. But Polish President Andrzej Duda said Tuesday that his country would not send fighter jets to Ukraine ""because that would open military inference in the Ukrainian conflict.""

""The point of the climate test is to say it's all the red line,"" Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president of energy and environment policy at the Center for American Progress, told CNN, indicating the groups consider the entire package of requests a must-pass. ""If you look at the total package here, it's a fraction of the $3.5 trillion they're talking about."" The letter outlines demands including $191 billion to $265 billion for 10-year direct-pay tax credits for clean electricity generation like wind and solar, and $37 billion to $120 billion for clean-vehicle tax credits for both new and used electric vehicles. It calls for Congress to fund at least a $150 billion Clean Electricity Payment Program, which would provide incentives and payments for electricity suppliers to gradually increase the amount of clean electricity they produce, and at least $20 billion for grants and rebates to make homes more sustainable and energy efficient. The letter seeks at least $27 billion for a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator - also known as a green bank - which would leverage private funding and work to get more clean energy projects to disadvantaged communities. The climate groups also call on Congress to impose fees on the oil and gas industry and end fossil fuel subsidies. Together, the groups estimate, this would raise between $35 billion and $55 billion over 10 years. The provisions the groups list are already included in the budget reconciliation framework Congress approved last month, although it's not yet determined how much funding each will receive. Environmental and climate groups are going to lobby lawmakers to not trim the overall size of the climate provisions in reconciliation, underscoring that they make up a relatively small portion of the overall price tag. ""Failure is not an option to get this done,"" Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters, told CNN.

Joe Manchin to ""Obviously, I don't agree,"" Pelosi told CNN when asked about Manchin's In another sign of a looming clash, Pelosi showed little desire to pare back the massive $3.5 trillion price tag, a top-level spending amount that Manchin and ""The number is the number, $3.5 (trillion), we can't go above that,"" Pelosi said. Asked about the likelihood she will have to go below that level, the California Democrat responded, ""Why?"" Manchin has been privately suggesting to his colleagues that $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion is the price tag he could accept in the Democrats' reconciliation bill, according to a source who has spoken to him. He has suggested that the 2017 tax law - which he opposed - could be amended to raise enough money to ensure the bill is fully paid for, the source said. Manchin, however, has indicated to his leadership that he's willing to negotiate, but that number is a fraction of the $3.5 trillion package that the party is trying to coalesce behind - and that liberals are demanding. Manchin's spokesperson declined to comment. Pressed earlier Tuesday about Manchin and Sinema's resistance to the price tag, Pelosi said, ""Well you have to go talk to the Senate about that, but we're going to pay for as much of it as possible."" The comments underscore the precarious situation Democrats are in as they attempt to push through a multi-trillion economic package with the slimmest of majorities, a proposal that would dramatically expand the social safety net and ratchet up government spending on key Democratic priorities on health care and climate change - and raise taxes to help pay for them. Behind the scenes, Democrats are still struggling to find consensus on a wide-range of issues, including the expansion of Medicare called for by progressives. Pelosi downplayed the disagreements, and argued the bill would be ""transformative"" for women in the workplace. ""I'm pretty excited about where we are,"" Pelosi said. ""Everybody's working very hard. The committees are doing their work. We're on a good timetable, and I feel very exhilarated by it."" But with a 50-50 Senate, Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote to secure passage of a $3.5 trillion bill since the party is using a process known as reconciliation to circumvent the filibuster's 60-vote threshold and instead pass the bill with a simple majority. All Republicans are expected to oppose it. Manchin and Sinema have made clear they won't support a bill with that price tag, with the West Virginia Democrat saying last week he won't support ""anywhere near that level of additional spending"" without examining the effect on the debt and inflation. Instead, moderate Democrats have demanded that Pelosi allow a vote Pelosi ""That's the plan,"" Pelosi said Tuesday when asked about the September 27 infrastructure vote. September amounts to a high-stakes month for the Biden agenda as Democratic leaders have set a September 15 deadline to finalize the reconciliation proposal, and House committees have already begun taking action on their individual pieces of the larger proposal. The House Natural Resources and Oversight Committees had votes of their portions of the $3.5 trillion package last week, and House Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva of Arizona announced that the committee On top of that, Congress is facing a number of other deadlines that threaten to overwhelm the congressional calendar. A government funding deadline looms at the end of the month, and there is also an unresolved debt ceiling fight waiting in the wings. Without a bill Pelosi, leaving the House floor on Tuesday, wouldn't say how Democrats will try to address the debt ceiling hike - and whether they would try to attach it to a must-pass bill to fund the government past September 30. It is widely expected that Democrats will attach the debt ceiling hike to the government funding bill, daring Republicans to vote against it. Republicans, meanwhile, are digging in to say they won't approve an increase - and are calling on Democrats to approve it on their own. ""We'd like to do it in a bipartisan way of course, that's how it's always been done,"" she told reporters. Pelosi wouldn't say if Democrats would try to pass a debt ceiling hike through the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to do it along straight party lines without any GOP votes. Democrats have rejected GOP calls to go that route, saying that Republicans must shoulder the burden of the politically toxic vote to raise the national borrowing limit. ""We have several options,"" Pelosi said when asked if they'd go the straight party-line route if Republicans block the debt ceiling bill. Pelosi indicated that the White House on Tuesday afternoon would send over its request for programs to be included in the stop-gap funding bill, known in the Capitol as the continuing resolution, or CR.

Global food prices are already near 10-year highs and the two countries' market share means that any disruption in exports Ukraine is dubbed the The Middle East was Ukraine's third largest wheat buyer in the 2020/2021 market year, according to the US Department of Agriculture. More than 40% of the country's recent wheat exports went to the Middle East or Africa alone. The International Monetary Fund projected that energy costs and commodities prices in many countries would rise should a conflict occur. The effect on the Middle East, however, could be far worse than other countries, said Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council of Foreign Affairs. ""Fears of conflict hanging over two of the world's major suppliers are clearly going to have some impact on prices, when there is already a sense of shortage,"" he said.

Authorities there are already warning about a shortage. Russia is Egypt's primary supplier of wheat; Ukraine is its second. ""Skirmishes between two of the largest wheat and grains exporters in the world raises uncertainty in the market,"" Minister of Supply and Internal Trade Ali Moselhy was cited as saying by state news agency MENA on Sunday. Moselhy later told Reuters that a shortage could be covered by local suppliers for the time being, adding that he was ""not concerned."" A longer-term shortage could exacerbate an already dire food security situation in some of the region's countries. Nearly 69 million people in the Middle East and North Africa are undernourished, according to a 2020 UN report, accounting for almost 9% of the global total. Many are in countries torn by conflict. Hunger has been on the rise since 2014 in the region, says the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), with livelihoods plummeting after the Arab Spring uprisings and again after the Covid-19 pandemic. FAO placed the region's prevalence of undernourishment in 2020 at 15.8%, compared to the global average of 9.9%. ""The real issue here is that there is a massive humanitarian crisis unfolding across the region, and those needs are already not being met,"" said Barnes-Dacey. States and donors might be able to procure grain from other sources but rising prices could impede an already underfunded network of importers, analysts said. ""When current needs are already going unmet, it is hard to imagine that you'll be able to secure this massive new push needed to meet new needs,"" said Barnes-Dacey, noting that the region's most volatile states might ""not even find it within the realm possibility"" to secure additional sources.

He called the event ""dangerous"" and alien to Kuwaiti society on his Twitter page. Alhusainan told CNN the Ministry of Interior subsequently stopped the retreat from taking place, attributing the cancellation to the absence of a permit.

Almaha Almari, a rights activist who organized the protest, said many events take place in the desert without permits.

Many developing countries are struggling with vaccine rollouts as wealthier nations bought up huge amounts of the global supply in agreements with pharmaceutical companies, often well before the shots were even approved. ""The UK has been too slow in delivering its vaccines support to delegates in vulnerable countries and their quarantine requirements come with some eye-watering hotel costs.

""If COP26 goes ahead as currently planned, I fear it is only the rich countries and NGOs from those countries that would be able to attend. This flies in the face of the principles of the UN process and opens the door for a rich nations stitch-up of the talks.

CAN Executive Director Tasneem Essop called for the talks to be postponed, saying she was concerned the countries worst affected by the climate crisis would be left out of the very negotiations that implicate them the most. ""There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the UN climate talks and this is now compounded by the health crisis,"" Essop said. ""Looking at the current timeline for COP26, it is difficult to imagine there can be fair participation from the Global South under safe conditions and it should therefore be postponed."" CAN also said that many delegates had not received their first vaccines. Most Covid-19 vaccines require two shots and are typically spaced out by around least eight weeks. The Glasgow talks are now just two months away.

In remarks sent to CNN, he said: ""COP26 has already been postponed by one year, and we are all too aware climate change has not taken time off.

But weakening growth in the closing months of 2021 suggests that trouble is still on the horizon as the country contends with a The 2021 growth figure is roughly in line with the expectations set by many economists. And it outstrips the Chinese government's target last year for its economy to expand at least 6%. But GDP expanded just 4% in the last quarter of the year compared to a year prior, according to government figures released Monday, the slowest pace in a year and a half. ""As everyone has seen, domestic growth is under pressure,"" said Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, at a press conference in Beijing on Monday. Growth in the fourth quarter was bolstered by industrial production, which rose 4.3% in December from a year earlier -- accelerating from November's 3.8% growth. That was thanks in part to the continued strength of exports. Shipments from China beat forecasts and jumped 21% in December, bringing the value of China's exports for the year to nearly $3.4 trillion. But consumption dramatically weakened amid renewed Covid-related disruptions, such as the massive outbreaks in Property investment and new housing projects that have started construction also declined. While the final quarter was ""better than expected,"" according to Larry Hu, head of China economics for Macquarie Group, the economy faces ""multiple headwinds"" this year, especially from Omicron and the real estate sector. Hu said in a research note that Monday's interest rate cut indicated that the People's Bank of China was now ready to loosen monetary policy further. He suspected that China's ""Downward pressure on growth will persist in 2022,"" wrote Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, ""As a result, we project disappointing consumption growth this year, especially"" in the first half of 2022, Kuijs added. A troubled real estate sector China has been contending with a slew of problems recently, including tumult in its property sector. Troubled Chinese real estate developer Evergrande -- which has some $300 billion of total liabilities -- has been Monday's statistics showed that property investment grew 4.4% And ""We expect further weakness [of the housing sector] over the coming quarters amid tight financing constraints for developers,""  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, in a Monday research note. China's Zero-Covid policy will persist Beijing's unwavering insistence on stamping out any trace of the coronavirus, meanwhile, is facing a huge test as authorities grapple with stubborn outbreaks and lock down large swaths of the population to contain them. Economists have warned that China's zero-Covid approach to containing the virus could spell serious problems for the economy in 2022. Goldman Sachs, for example, slashed its projection for Chinese economic growth in 2022 to 4.3% from 4.8%, just over half of last year's figure. They expect consumption to be worst hit as a result of the strict Covid curbs. December's weak retail sales data ""The resurgence of regional outbreak and lockdowns, as well as supply bottlenecks in the automobile industry, all weighed on consumption,"" said Zhu from JP Morgan Asset Management. Now the threat that Omicron poses to factories and supply chains is compounding the problem. Ship congestion at Chinese ports has worsened recently as more cities implement strict Covid restrictions because of the outbreaks. Some places are also tightening testing policies ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday season starting January 31. The Shekou terminal in Shenzhen, for example, has begun restricting truckers bringing in loaded containers. As of Friday, truckers can only enter the terminal if they have bookings for export-bound containers on vessels arriving within three days, according to a recent statement from the operator. More easing expected Those economic challenges likely mean, though, that the Chinese government is going to have to take more drastic steps to keep things running smoothly. Before the central bank cut interest rates on Monday, it had already started loosening its purse strings. Last month, it slashed both the the The But Zhu from JP Morgan Asset Management pointed out that these measures don't seem to have been enough just yet. Bank lending to the private sector, for example, has yet to meaningfully rebound. ""This suggests that business confidence has not been restored,"" he wrote. ""Therefore further policy easing at a longer time horizon is essential."" Zhu expects the central bank to make further cuts to the loan prime rate in the coming months.  China could also allow local governments to issue more special bonds in 2022. Such bonds mainly fund infrastructure projects, which can help spur investment and create more jobs.

More than four years on, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - better known as ""the Quad"" - is far from dissipating. Instead, it has only grown in momentum, profile and clout. Convened around the mantra of promoting a ""free and open Indo-Pacific,"" the four countries have held two naval exercises since 2020. Their leaders have assembled three times since last year - including an On Tuesday, the four leaders will meet face to face again in Tokyo. Their summit will be a highlight of Joe Biden's first trip to Asia as the US President, as he seeks to The renewed activity has seen China's initial scorn turn into alarm, with Beijing viewing the grouping as part of Washington's attempt to encircle the country with strategic and military allies. Wang, the foreign minister, has That concern has only grown since the Ukraine crisis. Beijing's backing of Moscow has further damaged its global image, leaving it more isolated on the world stage. And that is not helped by China's insistence on a zero-Covid policy, in which stringent border restrictions are cutting the country off from a world that has largely moved on from the pandemic. While Biden travels the world to reinforce ties, his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping hasn't left China in 25 months. Biden's latest flurry of diplomacy, with stops in South Korea and Japan, has particularly irked Beijing. ""The Indo-Pacific strategy cooked up by the United States, in the name of 'freedom and openness,' is actually keen on forming cliques,"" Wang said Sunday as Biden wrapped up his trip to Seoul and ""It claims that it intends to 'change China's surrounding environment,' but its purpose is to contain China and make Asia-Pacific countries serve as 'pawns' of US hegemony,"" Wang added. But experts stress that the Quad is not an Asian NATO and neither does it aspire to become one. Instead, they say its flexibility as an informal forum allows it to build more partnerships and expand areas for cooperation - including on the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that Biden is expected to launch in Tokyo. ""The Quad is trying to emphasize that it has a positive agenda, which is much more about delivering what the Indo-Pacific region needs - versus becoming an anti-China, NATO-like entity, which is a reputation that it's been trying very hard to combat in the region,"" said Kristi Govella, deputy director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund. The driving force behind the Quad China's initial dismissal of the Quad was partly based on precedent. A previous iteration of the Quad - proposed in 2007 by Japan's then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - lasted barely a year due to But the geopolitical and strategic calculus in the region has shifted drastically over the past decade. Under Xi, China has abandoned former leader Deng Xiaoping's decades-old mantra of ""hide your strength, bide your time."" Instead, it has pursued a more assertive foreign policy, readily flexing its economic muscle and military might. A year after Xi took office, China started building - and increasingly militarizing - artificial islands throughout the contested waters of the Early in the pandemic, China imposed a flurry of trade sanctions on Australia after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19. And along its disputed Himalayan border with India, Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed in their deadliest conflict in four decades. The tensions have driven these countries closer into the orbit of Washington, which under Biden has made the strategic rivalry with China a centerpiece of its foreign policy. ""The biggest driver of the Quad's revival is the growing assertiveness and aggressiveness of China,"" said Yuki Tatsumi, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center. ""Its behavior not only in the East and South China Seas but also in the Indian Ocean all the way down around the Pacific island area resulted in bringing Quad countries' perception of China closer together."" As Beijing grows more distant from the West and its allies, it has moved ever closer to Moscow - but their ""Beijing's backing of Moscow reconfirmed the image of China as the disrupter of the existing international order that the countries in this region all have benefited - and continue to benefit - from,"" Tatsumi said. While the Quad has never explicitly mentioned China in public, it is hard to miss the thinly veiled references. Last September, when the four leaders met in person in Washington, they In response, Chinese diplomats have repeatedly lashed out at the Quad for ""disrupting regional peace and stability."" Building ""closed and exclusive small circles or groups is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe,"" Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in March. ""If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences, and ultimately push the Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss,"" he said. Not 'Asia's NATO' NATO's swift and coordinated response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has likely alarmed Beijing, say experts, who suggest its leaders are watching Western reaction to Ukraine with Taiwan in mind. China views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve unification. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they've been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island - a show of force that is not lost on other countries in the region. When the Quad leaders convened in March to talk about the Ukraine crisis, they agreed that ""unilateral changes to the status quo with force like this should not be allowed in the Indo-Pacific region."" But Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University, stressed that the Quad is not a formal alliance like NATO. ""It can't be Asia's NATO. What structures the region's security is a set of bilateral alliances concluded by the US after World War II - with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines. So there's not such a thing as NATO in east Asia,"" he said. And unlike Japan and Australia, India is not a US ally - following a foreign policy tradition of non-alignment the country has adopted since independence. There are structural differences too. Experts say in recent years the Quad has pivoted away from an overt focus on security issues to include more areas of cooperation, in an attempt to better address regional needs. At their first virtual summit in March last year, the Quad leaders pledged to supply a billion Covid-19 vaccines across Asia by the end of 2022. The Quad has also formed working groups on climate change, technological innovation and supply-chain resilience. During his trip to Tokyo, Biden is expected to unveil the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework - a long-sought plan to step up US economic engagement with the region. Experts say the framework could provide momentum for closer economic cooperation among the Quad countries - such as in infrastructure and supply-chain resilience. In the eyes of Beijing, these efforts will likely be seen as a direct challenge. On Sunday, Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, said while China is always happy to see proposals conducive to regional cooperation, it is opposed to attempts to create division and conflict. ""Anyone attempting to isolate China with some framework will only isolate themselves. Rules made up to exclude China are bound to be abandoned by developments of our time,"" he But the Quad will need to demonstrate that it can deliver on its promises. Previous US attempts to boost economic ties with the region, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, have floundered, and the US will need to persuade potential allies and partners that it will stay committed to the region beyond Biden's term. Susannah Patton, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, said the Quad had already exceeded many analysts' expectations. ""The Quad is a vehicle for (its members) to present a different vision of how the region should work, and to signal to Beijing that it won't have things its own way all the time,"" she said. ""As for the future, how it evolves will in large part depend on China's behavior. If China continues to undermine regional norms and coerce other countries, the Quad will respond.""",China is alarmed by the Quad. But its threats are driving the group closer together

""They agreed to engage on both sets of issues openly and straightforwardly. This discussion, as President Biden made clear, was part of the United States' ongoing effort to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the PRC."" Biden addressed White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Friday that the pair also discussed the issue of the Covid-19 pandemic's origin and China's unwillingness to allow an investigation into the matter, though she declined to elaborate on what was said. ""It was a topic raised, but I'm not going to go into further details,"" Psaki said during a White House press briefing, adding that the US position - China should allow World Health Organization personnel to investigate - has been clear. Biden also raised concerns over human rights, Psaki said, without providing specifics. The Biden administration has signaled that it plans to continue According to Chinese state media Xinhua news, Xi told Biden that America's policy towards China has caused ""serious difficulties"" for the countries' relations. ""If China and the US work together, both countries and the world will benefit; If China and the US confront each other, both countries and the world will suffer. China-US relation is not a choice question that whether it needs to be done well, but a required question that how to do it well,"" Xi said, according to the Xinhua report. The Chinese leader said the two countries can continue dialogue to ""promote the coordination and cooperation"" on issues such as climate change, Covid-19 and other international issues. The call marked the leaders' second time speaking since Biden became President, with the During the Biden administration's first face-to-face with Chinese officials earlier this year, the two sides traded diplomatic barbs that are rarely displayed in front of the cameras. Biden officials said they planned to address areas of deep concern regarding China's actions, which triggered an aggressive response from the Chinese officials. ""We continue to believe that setting parameters and guardrails for the competition, and maintaining open lines of communication, is really important. But these lower-level engagements have not been very fruitful, and, candidly, we've not been very satisfied with our interlocutors' behavior,"" the senior official said prior to the call. ""Given this reality, and you know what has been our consistent approach from the get-go about responsible management of the competition, about lines of communication, President Biden understood the importance of engaging President Xi directly on these issues."" The official added that ""it's quite likely that engagement at the leader level is really what's needed to move the ball forward,"" given Xi's centralized power. The guardrails for the relationship that Biden was expected to discuss on Thursday included When it comes to specific matters of tension between the two countries, the official did not provide a fulsome list but said North Korea and Iran could be discussed in the context of broadly discussing the relationship. The overall goal, the official said, was to reach a ""steady state of affairs with the United States and China."" But that will be a tall task, given that Biden has framed the US-China competition in recent months as a battle between democracy and autocracy. On the topic of Afghanistan and the Taliban, the official said the administration did not expect Biden to make a ""particular ask"" of China, and following the call, the official would only say the leaders talked about ""global events."" Earlier this week, China US officials say they still hope to set up an in-person meeting between Biden and Xi Jinping, but aren't sure it will occur on the sidelines of the G20 at the end of October. That is primarily because Xi, who has not left China in roughly 600 days - since before the start of the pandemic - has not confirmed he will attend the summit in Rome. It's possible Xi participates in the summit virtually, and US officials aren't ruling out a virtual meeting between Biden and his counterpart.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/world/air-pollution-life-expectancy-climate-intl/index.html,"CNN Air pollution is slashing years from billions of people's lives around the world and is a greater In countries where air pollution levels are below standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO), people are, on average, losing 2.2 years of their lives. India has the highest levels of air pollution globally and its residents stand to lose more years than those of any other country, with an average of 5.9 years shaved off their lives, according to the In northern India, 480 million people are breathing pollution levels more than 10 times higher than those anywhere else on the planet. In some parts of this region, including the cities of Delhi and Kolkata, residents could lose up to nine years of their lives, on average, if the pollution levels documented in 2019 persist. The index calculates years lost based on what the life expectancy would be if a country met clean air guidelines set by WHO. The top five countries with the highest average number of years lost were all in Asia. After India came Bangladesh, where residents lose an average of 5.4 years of life expectancy, followed by Nepal (5 years), Pakistan (3.9 years) and Singapore (3.8 years). The report's authors said that air pollution was primarily driven by the use and production of fossil fuels creating ""a global problem that requires strong policies at every front."" The study also points to how the world has enjoyed cleaner skies and air as the pandemic forced a pause on air travel, and reduced road traffic and manufacturing. But at the same time, some parts of the world experienced high levels of air pollution from wildfires, exacerbated by hotter and drier weather conditions. In the US, smog from relentless wildfires in some western states traveled across the country, impacting air quality as far away as New York City. ""These remarkable events illustrate that air pollution is not only a global challenge, but is also intertwined with climate change. Both challenges are primarily caused by the same culprit: fossil fuel emissions from power plants, vehicles and other industrial sources,"" the report said. It called on the world's governments to urgently implement policies to reduce its dependence on fuels like coal, oil and gas. ""The Air Quality Life Index shows that strong pollution policies pay back in additional years of life for people across the world."" World leaders will gather in the Scottish city of Glasgow in November for international climate talks, known as COP26, and putting an end date to ""unabated coal"" is high on the agenda. Some fossil fuel companies are arguing for their futures by ""capturing"" enough of the greenhouse gases from their fuels to prevent them from entering the atmosphere, causing air pollution and climate change. Asia megacities at risk Drilling down to the city level, people in Asian megacities are suffering some of the highest levels of pollution, and with them, the greatest impacts on life expectancy. In the Indonesian city of Bandung, for example, people lose an average of almost seven years from their lives, and in the country's capital, Jakarta, it's nearly six years. In Central and West Africa, the harmful effects of air pollution on life expectancy was ""comparable to those of well-known threats like HIV/AIDS and malaria,"" the report found. And more than half of the 611 million people living across Latin America are exposed to air pollution levels that exceed WHO guidelines. Across the region, air pollution reduces life expectancy by five months on average, but that varies greatly according to location. In the Peruvian capital, Lima, people can expect to lose an average of 4.7 years off their lives. China's 'war on pollution' There is some cause for hope though. China was in the top five most polluted countries every year from 1998 to 2016. But since beginning its so-called ""war on pollution"" in 2013, it has reduced its particulate pollution by 29% - accounting for three-quarters of air pollution reductions worldwide. That reduction - if sustained - has won back 1.5 years of life expectancy for Chinese people, taking them down to an average loss of 2.6 years. ""To put China's success into context, it took several decades and recessions for the United States and Europe to achieve the same pollution reductions that China was able to accomplish in six years,"" said the report. There was indeed a time when London was widely referred to as ""the big smoke"" for its dirty air, and Los Angeles was once the ""smog capital of the world."" Today, Americans are, on average, exposed to 62% less particulate pollution than in 1970. Likewise Europeans are on average exposed to 27% less than two decades ago - and gaining four months of life expectancy because of it, the report said.","Air pollution is cutting more years from people's lives than smoking, war or HIV/AIDS"

During the first incident on Wednesday morning, footage shared on social media showed Israeli officers striking screaming people with batons inside the darkened building. Eyewitnesses told CNN that police had smashed doors and windows to enter the mosque and deployed stun grenades and rubber bullets once inside. Video shared by Israeli police show forces holding riot shields up as fireworks were launched back at them, ricocheting off the walls. Israeli police said in a statement that its forces entered al-Aqsa after ""hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators (had) barricaded themselves"" inside. ""When the police entered, stones were thrown at them, and fireworks were fired from inside the mosque by a large group of agitators,"" according to the statement. The Palestinian Red Crescent in Jerusalem said at least 12 people were injured during clashes in and around the mosque, and at least three of the injured were transferred to hospital, some with injuries from rubber bullets. The Red Crescent added that at one point its ambulances were targeted by police and were prevented from reaching the injured. Police said they arrested and removed more than 350 people in the mosque, and that two Israeli police officer were wounded. Images shared on social media showed dozens of detained people lying facedown on the floor of the mosque with their legs and arms bound behind their backs, and others with their hands tied being led into a vehicle. During the second incident on Wednesday evening, armed Israeli forces deployed stun grenades and ordered Muslims worshipping there to leave immediately, video posted to social media shows. The Israeli police said in a statement that ""dozens of law-breaking juveniles, some of them masked"" had thrown fireworks and stones into the mosque and tried to barricade themselves inside. ""The police forces prevented the lawbreakers from closing the doors and from barricading themselves (inside), and helped the worshipers leave the Mosque,"" Israeli police said. One eyewitness, cameraman Rami Khatib, told CNN that after moving worshippers out of the mosque, the Israeli police had stationed officers at each doorway and prevented people from entering. The Palestinian Red Crescent in Jerusalem treated six people for their injuries and transferred two of them to hospital. Growing condemnation Wednesday morning's incident drew condemnation from across the Arab and Muslim world. Jordan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the Israeli police actions ""in the strongest terms,"" and called on Israel to immediately remove its forces from the mosque. Jordan has also called for an extraordinary meeting of the Arab League to discuss the development. Egypt's Foreign Ministry meanwhile condemned the ""storming"" of the mosque by police, saying it had caused ""numerous injuries among worshipers and devotees"" and was ""in violation of all international laws and customs."" The US Office of Palestinian Affairs called for restraint following Wednesday morning's raid, saying on Twitter: ""Violence has no place in a holy site and during a holy season. Alarmed by the shocking scenes in Al Aqsa Mosque and rockets launched from Gaza toward Israel. We call for restraint and de-escalation to allow peaceful worship and to protect the sanctity of the holy sites."" 'A major crime against worshipers' Over the last two weeks, there have been calls by Jewish extremist groups to slaughter goats at the mosque compound as part of an ancient Passover holiday ritual that is no longer practiced by most Jews. A greater number of Muslim worshipers stayed in the mosque after calls came to prevent those attempts. Last week, a Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli police at the entrance of the compound. Palestinian and Israeli sources disputed the circumstances that led to the killing of 26-year-old Muhammad Al-Osaibi. The mosque compound, frequently a flashpoint in tensions, is home to one of Islam's most revered sites but also the holiest site in Judaism, known as the Temple Mount. In a statement Wednesday, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh condemned the actions of the Israeli police, saying: ""What is happening in Jerusalem is a major crime against worshipers."" ""Israel does not want to learn from history, that al-Aqsa is for the Palestinians and for all Arabs and Muslims, and that storming it sparked a revolution against the occupation,"" Shtayyeh added. Aviv Bushinsky, a former media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN situations that impact Israel's security could unite a divided nation, but said that isn't likely to have been the motivation behind Israel's storming of al-Aqsa mosque. Bushinsky added he thought it was in Netanyahu's interests to ease tensions Bushinsky said that the average Israeli would not, however, support any extreme Israeli measures against Palestinians in Jerusalem as that would be ""too risky."" ""I think it is in the interest of Netanyahu and even Ben Gvir to try to ease the tension in the Al Aqsa mosque,"" he said.

Gaza rockets The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Wednesday that around 12 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip toward Israel after the incident in Jerusalem. Two were fired late on Wednesday, the IDF said. Earlier in the day, 10 rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel, five of which fell in open fields and one that fell on a factory in Sderot leaving no casualties, the IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari had said in a previous statement. Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, said in a statement that ""the current Israeli occupation's crimes at the al-Aqsa mosque are unprecedented violations that will not pass."" Later on Wednesday, the Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck weapons manufacturing and storage sites in the Gaza Strip belonging to Hamas. ""This strike was carried out in response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip toward Israeli territory earlier,"" it said in a statement.

Stoltenberg's comments came a day after NATO announced that some member countries were putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe. The moves signaled mounting fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, following months of military maneuvering by Moscow that has set off a tit-for-tat series of escalations with NATO.

The barrage from Lebanon was the largest since a 2006 war between the two countries. Violence continued to spiral Friday when two sisters, aged 16 and 20, with dual British-Israeli citizenship, were killed and their mother was seriously wounded in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank.

""The Arab leadership headed by Ra'am and the Islamic Movement will not accept in any way the use of violence against any citizen regardless of religion, race or nationality,"" Abbas added. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, international spokesperson for the IDF, said that it was dealing with a ""convergence of frontiers"" in the region. ""An event started off in Jerusalem got expanded to Gaza, Hamas and into Lebanon,"" he told CNN. In Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes hit an open area near the southern coastal city of Tyre. The Israeli military believes Palestinian factions launched dozens of rockets from that city. Israel has blamed Hamas, the militant group which controls Gaza, for the rocket launches. ""The IDF will not allow the Hamas terrorist organization to operate from within Lebanon and holds the state of Lebanon responsible for every directed fire emanating from its territory,"" the IDF said in a statement. Some regional countries have reportedly intervened to de-escalate tensions. A Qatari official told CNN that the gas-rich Gulf country was mediating to ""deescalate the situation on all sides."" ""Qatar's primary goal is to prevent unnecessary bloodshed and avoid destructive consequences for Palestinians and civilian populations,"" the official said. It is unclear which of the warring parties Qatari officials have been communicating with. Qatar does not have official diplomatic relations with Israel. The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, which holds sway over south Lebanon, has neither denied nor claimed responsibility for the attacks. But the powerful Iran-backed armed group warned that ""hundreds of millions of Muslims"" were prepared to ""shed blood"" in response to the Israeli police raids on al-Aqsa. In recent months, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said that violations at the mosque compound in Jerusalem's old city would cause ""all hell to break loose in the region."" Israel has not blamed Hezbollah for the attack. On Friday afternoon, Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN that the government had ""no information"" on whether Hezbollah greenlit the strikes. ""We know we have a very tough and difficult situation in south Lebanon. Hezbollah is there and they are armed. The Lebanese army and UNIFL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) are also there and working with others in order to stop such things, but they are not always successful,"" Bou Habib said. The foreign minister said that the ministry understands the attack ""had its reasons...but we don't like it coming from Lebanon."" ""What happened in Aqsa is the reason for what happened in Lebanon yesterday. I'm not justifying it ... I'm explaining that what happened in al-Aqsa is very important and really there is a reaction,"" Bou Habib added. Lebanon said it would submit an official complaint to the UN Security Council, calling Israel's strikes a ""flagrant violation of Lebanon's sovereignty."" Hamas also condemned the strikes in a statement Friday, and expressed ""solidarity with the Lebanese people."" In a separate statement, it condemned Israel's strikes on the Gaza Strip. In Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Israeli strikes damaged a children's hospital, causing distress to the young patients inside. ""This is not the first time that health facilities have been targeted, and it is unacceptable,"" the ministry added in a statement. Hecht said the Israeli strikes targeted 10 sites in Gaza, including production sites and research and development sites as well as tunnel infrastructure. In earlier statements, the IDF said it hit several Hamas weapons manufacturing sites, an underground weapons complex, and ""terror"" tunnels in Beit Hanoun and Khan Yunis.

Videos posted on social media showed rockets from Lebanon streaking through the skies over northern Israel, and the sounds of explosions in the distance. Israel closed its northern airspace in the wake of the barrage. Footage from inside the mosque on Wednesday showed Israeli officers beating people with their batons and rifle-butts, then arresting hundreds of Palestinians. Israeli police said they entered the mosque after ""hundreds of rioters"" tried to barricade themselves inside. Hecht, the IDF international spokesman, linked the rocket fire to the two Israeli incursions into the al-Aqsa mosque, saying they had created ""very negative energies."" ""The context of the story starts two days ago on Temple Mount with these very, very harsh pictures coming out of the prayer at night,"" Hecht said, using the Jewish name for the Jerusalem holy site, which is known to Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. The foreign minister for Jordan, the custodian of the al-Aqsa mosque and other Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, said ""we are at a very dangerous moment."" ""What we see unfolding on the Lebanese border is obviously a consequence, a reaction to what we saw happening in al-Aqsa (mosque),"" Ayman Safadi told CNN on Thursday.

The province is home to a quarter of the country's coal production. The adjacent Shaanxi province, which ranks third in the country for coal output, also reported heavy rains and mudslides that hurt operations at local mines, according to the the state-owned The price of thermal coal futures, which is primarily used to generate power, surged to all-time highs Monday on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange -- up as much as 12% to 1,408 yuan ($219) per metric ton. The price has more than doubled so far this year. Coal is the main source of energy in China and is widely used for heating, power generation, and steelmaking. Last year, it made up nearly 60% of China's total energy use. And the extreme weather hit just as China was attempting to ease power shortages by ramping up coal production and allowing coal-fired power stations to charge more for their electricity. Energy shortages have spread to 20 Chinese provinces in recent weeks, forcing the government to ration electricity during peak hours and some factories to suspend production. That's hurt industrial output and is weighing on Why is China short of power? The power shortage is a result of a range of factors that have boosted demand and reduced supply. China's post-pandemic construction boom has been heavily reliant on fossil fuels, while a national push to reduce carbon emissions led hundreds of coal mines to shut down or slash production earlier this year -- driving coal prices higher. Restrictions on coal from key supplier Australia and weather woes have exacerbated the issue. A hotter-than-usual summer pushed people to use a record amount of power in July, according to China's National Energy Administration. The agency added that overall power consumption from January to August grew 14% compared to the same time last year. But renewable energy sources, such as hydropower, have been hobbled by drought in recent months. ""China's electricity cuts will add to economic stresses, weighing on GDP growth for 2022,"" Moody's analysts said in a Monday report. They added that the ""risks to GDP forecasts could be larger as disruptions to production and supply chains feed through."" The problems led China's central government on Friday to allow ""Since the beginning of this year, energy prices in the international market have risen sharply, and domestic supply of power and coal have remained tight,"" the Power plants in China had been unwilling to boost production because of the high cost of coal. And since Beijing controls the cost of power, producers couldn't simply raise their prices without the go-ahead from the government. The government is taking other steps to ease the crunch. Authorities in Inner Mongolia -- China's second largest coal-producing province -- on Friday also asked 72 mines to boost production by 98.4 million metric tons, the equivalent of about 30% of China's monthly coal production. The energy problem may soon weigh on consumers in other ways, such as tangling supply chains during the upcoming holiday shopping season. The city of Yiwu in eastern Zhejiang province -- a major hub for e-commerce trade -- is struggling with widespread power cuts, according to the Shanghai-based The newspaper suggested that shortages and cuts in the city, which is the world's largest wholesale market for kitchenware, toys, electronics and other goods, could dampen China's annual Singles Day shopping bonanza later this year.

The UK-based BMJ, one of the journals that published the report, said that ""never before"" had so many health publications come together to make the same statement, ""reflecting the severity of the climate change emergency now facing the world."" The authors also warned that the aim to reach net zero - where the world emits no more greenhouse gases than it removes from the atmosphere - was relying on unproven technology to take gases like carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They added it was more likely that global warming would surpass 2degC, a threshold that climate scientists say would bring catastrophic extreme weather events, among other impacts to human, animal and plant life. Simply urging the world and energy industry to transition from fossil fuels to renewables falls short of the action needed to meet the challenge of the climate crisis, they said. The editorial was published as a call to action ahead of a several meetings between global leaders to discuss and negotiate action on the climate crisis, including the UN General Assembly next week, a biodiversity conference in Kunming, China, in October and crucial climate talks in the Scottish city of Glasgow in November. Among key climate issues expected to be addressed at these events are the 1.5degC target, putting an end date on the use of coal and protecting biodiversity, both on land and sea. ""The greatest threat to global public health is the continued failure of world leaders to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5degC and to restore nature. Urgent, society-wide changes must be made and will lead to a fairer and healthier world,"" the authors wrote.

That drove both The growth in demand was particularly intense in IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said the report contained Electricity has a crucial role to play in the fight against climate change as countries ditch fossil fuels and more battery-powered Electricity generated by renewables grew by 6% globally last year, while coal-fired generation leaped 9% due to high demand and skyrocketing natural gas prices, which made it look like a more attractive option. Carbon dioxide emissions from power generation rose 7% as a result, reaching an all-time high after declining the previous two years. ""Not only does this highlight how far off track we currently are from a pathway to net zero emissions by 2050, but it also underscores the massive changes needed for the electricity sector to fulfill its critical role in decarbonizing the broader energy system,"" Birol said in a statement. In the United States, coal-fired electricity generation spiked by 19% in 2021. The increase is likely to be temporary, though, with output from coal expected to decline by about 6% a year between 2022 and 2024, according to the IEA. There's some good news: Rapid expansion of renewable energy capacity should be enough to cover the vast majority of the growth in global electricity demand through 2024. Still, emissions will remain high.

US officials have referred to the But that doesn't mean officials are suggesting the objects are unexplainable in nature or even related to previously observed "" Officials are currently working to recover pieces of the three objects to pinpoint their intended purpose. US airspace is no stranger to voluminous, slow-moving objects. High-altitude balloons are used for a vast array of authorized purposes in the public and private sectors, such as Meteorologists launch high-altitude balloons from the United States dozens of Even individual citizens can launch their own high-altitude balloon for research, educational or entertainment purposes. For example, Emily Calandrelli, an engineer and media personality, launched a sonogram of her unborn child on a high-altitude balloon in 2019 and Here's a look at how high-altitude balloons work, what they're commonly used for, and how they compare with the unidentified objects in all the latest headlines. The 'unidentified objects' The events of the past two weeks sparked a broader conversation about a suspected campaign by China to use high-altitude balloons for reconnaissance. It's possible government officials in China hoped to use aerial craft, rather than rely on space-based spy satellites (of which there are many from the US, China and other countries), because a balloon travels closer to the ground, offering higher-quality images and data, said John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council, during Monday's He added that China's purported campaign isn't new, and it's likely that we're hearing more about these objects now only because the military is China has claimed the suspected spy balloon was actually a weather balloon that traveled off course, an account that US officials say isn't true. No country has claimed responsibility for the other three objects. Melissa Dalton, assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and hemispheric affairs, told reporters Sunday that the objects were taken down by military jets out of an ""abundance of caution,"" as they did not pose a physical threat to people on the ground. Dalton also acknowledged that high-altitude objects can be used by a range of companies, countries and research organizations for ""purposes that are not nefarious, including legitimate research."" How do high-altitude balloons work? There are many different configurations and types of high-altitude balloon, but they all function using the same principles. Prior to launch, the balloon is partially filled with a gas, such as hydrogen or helium. After release, as the balloon climbs and the air grows thinner, the gas The scientific instrument -- called a radiosonde -- that ascends attached to a weather balloon parachutes back to the ground once the mission is complete, according to the When balloons are used for authorized purposes, the Federal Aviation Administration approves their release ahead of time. The agency can then issue a notice to air mission, or NOTAM, which alerts aircraft pilots that airspace is restricted around the area where the balloon will be deployed. A similar process occurs Weather balloons and research balloons typically fly to altitudes of more than 100,000 feet (30,480 meters), well above where commercial aircraft typically fly, according to NASA and the National Weather Service. That's one reason why the objects shot down over the weekend were so concerning: They were found to be flying between 20,000 and 40,000 feet (6,096 and 12,192 meters), according to Kirby, and could have posed a risk to airborne planes.

The lawmakers are introducing this legislation with the hopes of it being included in The legislation, which has at least 125 original co-sponsors, is led by Reps. Pramila Jayapal, who also serves as Progressive Caucus chairwoman, Conor Lamb, Susan Wild, Haley Stevens, Joe Neguse, and Debbie Dingell.

Lowering the eligibility age from 65 to 60 is widely popular across the Democratic caucus, with 70% pledging to support the measure earlier this year. It is even a priority that Biden himself has called for. Lowering the eligibility age by five years would expand Medicare to at least 23 million people, according to the cosponsors of the legislation. In addition to trying to include a lower Medicare eligibility age in the reconciliation package, Democrats also want to use the voting maneuver, which allows them to pass legislation without relying on Republican votes, to also include a historic of expansion of Medicare to ""Expanding and improving this wildly popular program is not only the right thing to do from a policy perspective, it is also what the majority of Americans across party lines support,"" Jayapal said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/21/asia/japan-us-alliance-quad-summit-defense-hnk-dst-intl/index.html,"CNN Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is a man on a mission. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, he has imposed sanctions on Moscow, agreed to pursue a nuclear-free world with the Pope and taken a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia and Europe to rally world leaders to protect democracy. But it's not just democracy in Ukraine that he's trying to protect - Kishida sees parallels between Russia's actions in Europe and China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific, a region stretching from America's Pacific coastline to the Indian Ocean. ""We strongly oppose any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, regardless of the location,"" said Kishida, Japan's location places it in an increasingly volatile security environment - flanked by China to its south, nuclear-armed North Korea to the west and Russia to its north. As a result, the war in Ukraine has catalyzed debates on Japan's national security like never before. In April, members of the country's ruling party But Tokyo is not only investing in its defense, it's using diplomacy to strengthen its relationships in the region and beyond. Ahead of Kishida's meeting with United States President Joe Biden on Monday, experts say the world's third-largest economy is reevaluating its approach to deterrence and showcasing itself as a reliable partner on the world stage. A Japanese invention Japan floated its idea of an ""arc of freedom and prosperity"" that would stretch across the Indo-Pacific and draw in the US and Australia more than a decade ago. In 2007, Abe's attempts to unite Pacific allies came as China was overtaking Japan as the world's second-largest economy. Before long, Beijing was promoting its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to develop new trade routes connecting China with the world. China claims sovereignty almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea, and has turned multiple reefs and sandbars - far from its shoreline - into man-made artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems. Observers worried that China's expansion could eventually allow Beijing to control waterways in the South China Sea, threatening the free flow of trade, so in 2016, Abe upgraded his idea and introduced the concept of the ""free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)."" Under FOIP, like-minded countries and organizations across Southeast Asia and Africa would safeguard the Indo-Pacific, and the trillions of dollars of goods that pass through it each year. Cleo Paskal, an Indo-Pacific strategist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said countries were initially slow to catch on to FOIP. ""Many people didn't think FOIP was even an issue as they assumed the seas would be open and people would be free,"" she said. ""But now we're realizing that those two things of being free and open are actually under threat."" China's expansion in the region is expected to be one of the main points of discussion when Quad leaders meet in Tokyo on Tuesday, after Kishida's bilateral with Biden. Forging a stronger US security pact Japan's efforts to unite its democratic allies paid off when the US adopted FOIP in 2017, giving extra clout to the concept along with new resources, programs and partnerships. But now analysts say the US expects Japan to take on a stronger leadership role in the region, and Tokyo knows that means it needs to step up its defenses. ""Japan recognizes that if it relies solely on the United States that wouldn't really sustain the political confidence between the two sides,"" said Ken Jimbo, a national security expert and professor at Keio University. Last December Kishida announced the government was exploring options to give Japan the capability to strike enemy bases. Since then, calls have intensified from within Japan's ruling party to develop ""counterattack capabilities"" in coordination with the US. The move would stretch the limits of the country's pacifist constitution but expand Tokyo's ability to retaliate against mobile and submarine-launched attacks. ""Japan wants to be able to stand up for itself in a fight. The country has a very strong section of the population who don't want to be reliant on outside powers in order to be able to make decisions that might or may not risk its sovereignty,"" Paskal said. However, there's resistance within the country to any move away from Japan's pacifist stance. ""Popular public opinion still views Japan as a pacifist country that shouldn't have the ability to attack others, it should only have sufficient means in order to defend itself,"" said James Brown, an international relations expert at Temple University. ""So that concern has made the government move more slowly on this."" However, the war in Ukraine seems to be shifting attitudes. A recent poll conducted by Asahi Shimbun and the University of Tokyo showed 64% of 3,000 people surveyed were in favor of Japan strengthening its defensive capabilities - the highest percentage since the survey started in 2003. Managing China's influence China's support of Russia's actions in Ukraine has strengthened Kishida's mission to protect the integrity of the Indo-Pacific. Not only is he reaching out to larger allies in the US and Europe, he's engaging in diplomacy closer to home to make it clear Japan is a partner that can be relied upon in uncertain times. In March, a Japanese delegation visited the Japan also wants to offer an alternative to China by showcasing its own quality infrastructure projects, which use local labor, have high-quality controls and don't leave unsustainable debt burdens in participating countries, said Thomas Wilkins, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Tokyo's efforts have not gone unnoticed in Beijing. During a video call with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that even before Biden's arrival in Asia, the perception that Japan and the US were united against China ""was already rampant"" and had created ""a foul atmosphere,"" according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. Japan's assertive response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is on brand for a country that's trying to strengthen democratic ties in its own region. When Quad members meet in Tokyo on Tuesday, they'll be looking to present a united front that fits with Japan's original vision of the ""arc of freedom and prosperity."" Paskal said in that regard Japan's leadership in the region was ""respected and appreciated."" ""There's a lot left to be done, but it is moving in a way that many Japan watchers may not have expected even five years ago,"" she said.",Japan turns away from post-WWII pacifism as China threat grows
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/22/economy/debt-ceiling-economy/index.html,"CNN Business America's road to economic recovery is littered with obstacles, beginning with soaring If Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling, the federal government will likely run out of cash by October or November, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is already vowing that This raises the specter of Washington repeating the mistakes of the 2011 debt ceiling debacle by gambling with the full faith and credit of the United States. That episode sent markets into a tailspin and resulted in the ""The last thing the economy needs is an artificial crisis,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. ""The risk is that the political polarization in Washington is so intense that politicians who should know better begin to throw around words like 'default.'"" A default would be disastrous. US debt is considered among the safest securities on the planet, the benchmark for measuring all other risk. Even a near-default could send interest rates spiking, lifting the cost of borrowing on everything from car loans to mortgages. Markets would tumble. ""Few policy matters in Washington have such destructive economic capability,"" Chris Krueger, managing director at Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a note to clients Thursday. 'Cascading catastrophe' During a hearing in May, JPMorgan Chase Brusuelas echoed that sentiment. ""If one wants chaos across financial markets and a replay of the global financial crisis, this would be the quickest road to hell,"" he said. ""The adults in the room need to take control."" Yet this week McConnell signaled a brewing fight over the debt ceiling. ""I can't imagine there will be a single Republican voting to raise the debt ceiling after what we've been experiencing,"" the Senate minority leader said in an President Joe Biden responded by pointing out that Republicans had no problem raising the borrowing limit when a Republican was in the White House. ""You know, for the last four years, they've just extended the debt limit,"" Biden told reporters. In 2019, Congress voted to suspend the debt limit altogether, but that two-year suspension expires at the end of this month. The Treasury Department can take extraordinary steps to keep the lights on -- but not for long. Those measures will most likely be exhausted in October or November, the nonpartisan CBO estimated on Wednesday. 'We've been here before' This situation adds to the numerous question marks facing the US economy over ""The timing of the debt limit deadline and the intersection of the issue with the broader fiscal debate is likely to lead to elevated uncertainty in late September when Congress will need to extend spending authority,"" economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report sent to clients Wednesday night. Wall Street seems unfazed, for now at least. Despite ""We've been here before,"" Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital Markets, wrote in an email. LeBas said investors would become concerned only if there was a ""real risk"" that the US Treasury would fail to make payments on maturing Treasury bills. And he added that would probably be three to four months after emergency cash measures begin, suggesting ""there's plenty of time"" for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. The end game Goldman Sachs economists expect Congressional Democrats will combine the debt limit vote with a must-pass spending bill, a brinksmanship gambit that has been done in the past. ""While Senate Republican Leader McConnell has indicated that Republicans will not vote for suspending the debt limit, they might ultimately support it if the alternative is voting against spending authority, which would lead to a government shutdown,"" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in the note. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, doubts this will get settled through bipartisanship. He predicts Democrats will lift the debt ceiling through budget reconciliation as part of a major spending program, which requires only a simple majority. ""To me, this has always been the end game,"" Mills said. Even though many see a way to avoid a debt ceiling disaster, the brinksmanship itself only amplifies concerns about the political health of the United States. Fitch Ratings warned earlier this month that it could remove America's perfect credit rating due in part to worsening political polarization and the ongoing assault on democracy displayed by the January 6 insurrection. Fitch concluded that governance is a ""weakness"" in the United States -- and another standoff over the debt ceiling will only solidify its thinking.",Drama over the debt ceiling is the last thing America's economy needs

The banking sanctions are part of a broader package of measures the West has taken, unprecedented in scale against an economy of Russia's importance, with the aim of cutting off funding for Russian President Vladimir Putin's war effort. France estimates that $1 trillion worth of Russian assets have been frozen, including about half of the Russian government's war chest of reserves. Moscow has responded with a series of emergency measures aimed at preventing financial meltdown, halting the flow of cash out of the country and preserving its foreign currency reserves.

Putin also signed a decree banning people from taking more than $10,000 or equivalent in foreign currency from the country, state news agencies TASS and RIA reported. The central bank went further on Wednesday in its attempt to staunch the flow of money out of the country. It suspended transfers abroad from accounts held by non-resident corporate entities and individuals from a number of countries. The restriction does not apply to Russian citizens. ""Conditions in the Russian financial system and wider economy are likely to deteriorate further in the days and weeks ahead as the already announced sanctions take their toll and future sanctions add to the sustained negative shock,"" wrote Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering in a research note Wednesday.

Oil companies lead corporate exodus Russia's energy riches haven't been directly targeted by Western sanctions, but many of the world's biggest oil companies are quitting the country or halting new investments in projects to explore and develop fields. Moscow is also finding it harder to sell shipments of Russian crude oil to traders and refineries worried about being caught in the net of financial sanctions.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/15/australia/australia-election-xi-jinping-china-relations-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,"CNN The faces of Australian election candidates are plastered on campaign posters across the country - but there's one face that stands out, and it belongs to Xi Jinping. The Chinese leader, though not a participant in any modern democracy, has become a familiar presence in a campaign dogged by allegations of foreign interference and partly fought on issues of national security. Xi's face is not only on billboards, his name has come up in press conferences, interviews, and election debates between Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who leads a Liberal-National coalition, and the Labor Party leader who wants to replace him, Anthony Albanese. ""Xi has changed the nature of the Chinese Communist Party ... It's more forward leaning. It's more aggressive. And that means that Australia, of course, must respond,"" said Albanese during a leaders' debate, in words that appeared to echo the government's hardline stance. Before the federal election campaign even started, accusations were being hurled that China wanted a Labor win. One week out from the vote on May 21, public opinion polls - though notoriously unreliable - suggest that it may actually happen, putting a Labor government in power for the first time since 2013. How that may change Australia's relationship with China has been a common question ahead of the vote. The coalition has suggested Labor will be soft on China - a serious accusation by a government whose defense minister recently warned that, in order to preserve peace, Australia must ""prepare for war."" On paper, it seems there is little difference between both major parties on foreign policy. Labor says it's committed to the AUKUS security pact, the deal Morrison struck with the United States and United Kingdom, to the detriment of Australia's relations with France. And both support the Quad, the loose four-way alliance between Australia, the US, India and Japan that is set to meet in Tokyo next week, after the election. It's not clear yet who will attend on Australia's behalf, but analysts say that person faces a tough challenge when it comes to China - especially after a bitter election campaign that has put Xi and his intentions front and center. The unraveling of relations China was always going to play a role in the Australian election, as a regional heavyweight with significant trade ties to a smaller nation that it relies on for iron ore and coal, if not other sanctioned exports. Xi's rise to power in China neatly aligns with the coalition's latest stint in government - both took office in 2013, and since then relations have deteriorated, most rapidly in the last six years. Some of the angst stretches back to 2016, when links emerged between a senior Labor senator and a wealthy Chinese businessmen, prompting a closer inspection of alleged foreign political interference. Under then Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, laws were passed preventing foreigners from donating to Australian political campaigns, among other measures, and a ban was imposed on Chinese telecoms giants Huawei and ZTE from building Australia's 5G network. After the 5G ban, China's foreign affairs spokesman urged the country to ""abandon (its) ideological prejudices."" Relations soured further in 2020 when the Australian government - then led by Morrison - called for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19. China responded with sanctions against Australian exports, including beef, barley, wine, and rock lobster. Charles Edel, the inaugural Australia Chair and a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said China's aim was to make Australia more compliant, but it hasn't worked. ""It has had the opposite effect,"" he said. ""It hardened public attitudes in Australia and pushed Canberra to lead the charge against China's coercive actions."" According to the While sanctions have undoubtedly hurt Australian businesses, the loss of the Chinese market forced some to diversify and they've found replacement markets. China meanwhile continues to buy Australia's iron ore at near record prices. So in that respect, Australia hasn't lost. In fact, Edel says Australia's tough response to Beijing's coercion has created another model for other countries in the region to follow. ""Australia has reacted to a deteriorating strategic environment by investing in its own capabilities, increasing its cooperation with the United States, and reaching out to strengthen its connections with other countries in the region,"" he said. ""Pursuing a proactive foreign policy while investing in its own resilience offers a model for other states under pressure from revisionist powers."" Chances of a reset But there's no consensus on the success of the Morrison government's approach to China. During the election campaign, even as the coalition touted its superior experience in foreign affairs, Suddenly the specter of a Chinese military base on a nation just 2,000 kilometers (1,600 miles) from Australia's shores became a live election issue - even as the Solomon Islands and Beijing denied they had any such plans. The issue was so contentious that in the first few weeks of the campaign mentions of China and the Solomon Islands outpaced that of climate change across Australian media, according to media monitors Isentia. Labor slammed the deal as ""a massive foreign policy failure"" that occurred despite warnings that Honiara was moving closer to China. In the heat of an election campaign, it suits Labor to call out the coalition's foreign policy failings - in fact, the timing of the deal was so opportune for Labor that Home Minister Karen Andrews speculated, without evidence, that it was deliberately timed by Beijing to fall just weeks before the vote - a claim Labor attacked as ""unhinged."" Both sides say ""China has changed."" In recent years, Beijing has stepped up the militarization of the South China Sea, committed alleged human rights abuses against the minority Uyghur population in Xinjiang, and clamped down on freedoms in Hong Kong, where police recently But James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute, said the Morrison government must accept some responsibility for deteriorating relations. ""Rhetoric and posturing and a lack of diplomacy has actually played a pretty major role in how we got there,"" he said. ""We haven't just protected our sovereignty. We've gone out on a limb in front of any other country in the region to, I would argue, be pretty provocative,"" he said, citing Defense Minister Peter Dutton's comment that Australia should ""prepare for war"" as one example. Laurenceson doesn't see relations with Beijing improving under a re-elected Morrison government. ""I think they have given up on the Morrison government,"" he said, but added that a Labor win wouldn't necessarily mean a reset either. ""No one's talking about going back to the way the world was five years ago. But putting our relationship on a less adversarial stance, I think that's within our capacity. And I think Labor has options where it can make some subtle shifts in its diplomacy and that will make that a realistic option."" In an opinion piece published in Australian media last week, China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said Canberra should not see ""China's rise"" as a threat. ""The cooperation between China and the South Pacific island countries is conducive to people's well-being on both sides and regional prosperity and stability, and will by no means threaten Australia's security,"" he wrote. Where to from here Under Australian law, there are no rules on truth in political advertising, so using Xi's image on posters claiming he supports candidates of various political persuasions is entirely legal. Xi's face is not only on ads alleging he supports Labor but also on billboards claiming he's backing a Liberal candidate, as well as at least one independent. Appealing to Xi, it seems, is the highest political insult. Andrew Hughes, a marketing expert at the Australian National University, says Australia is known as the ""Wild West"" when it comes to political advertising, but the use of China in this campaign had nonetheless been remarkable. ""It's actually more noticeable, I think, in this election than I've ever seen the use of a foreign government in election campaigns outside wartime,"" Hughes said. Hughes said the coalition was using China to establish the connection in people's minds that ""Labor equals fear,"" though he questioned the effectiveness of that strategy with an audience with only half an eye on the issues. ""Most people don't have that level of engagement with politics in the first place to make that messaging effective.

Edel, from CSIS, said no matter who wins, Australia has a better chance of improving its relationship if it stands its ground, and that's possible under either leadership. ""While there may be differences in tone and approach, both parties now support increasing Australia's defense budget, working more closely with the United States and other like-minded countries, countering China's push into the Pacific, calling out Beijing's egregious human rights violations, and taking actions to protect Australia's democracy,"" he said. However, Laurenceson said a calmer approach and the realization that Australia can't dictate China's relationships in the Pacific would go a long way towards putting the relationship on a firmer footing. ""There's a track record of overreaction and panic, that's for sure. And how does that actually help you respond?"" he said. ""Having a strategy with a goal of denying the Beijing enhanced relationships in the region is just ridiculous. It's unrealistic. So yes, let's take it seriously, let's respond with a clear strategy.

Shattered glass still litters people's property. A ten-year-old child brandishes a spent Israeli military stun grenade, explaining he knows it's safe because the string that activates it is gone.

Huwara resident Nahawand Damidi's house is behind a metal fence, for protection against settler attacks. But Sunday night the violence reached another level, she told CNN on Thursday. ""[The settlers] usually attack us by throwing stones. If we try to defend ourselves they will use weapons, but last time was different. Wherever you looked there were bullets ... fires, fires everywhere,"" she said, standing on her balcony. Security camera footage residents shared with CNN show settlers - identified by their religious tassels, called tzitzit, hanging from under their sweatshirts - piling flammable material in front of 75-year-old Nawal Dumeidi's door, before setting it aflame. The double door is marred with black scar marks from the flames that literally melted the lock, Dumeidi said. Her two sons had to come back from Dubai to force open the door and free her, she told CNN. ""What happened is a wild terrorism,"" she said, adding she was stuck in her home for three days before she was able to leave. Villagers told CNN that they would normally expect the Israeli military to protect them from settler attacks but that on Sunday they did not. The top Israeli general in the West Bank, Major General Yehuda Fuchs, admitted earlier this week the ""We will wipe out Huwara"" Many Israelis go to Huwara to get their cars repaired - with prices being much cheaper than on the other side of the Green Line. The Abu Saris family owns one of those repair shops - but dozen of cars on their lot are now burnt. Daughter Lamar, 10, speaks confidently and openly about what happened - she's given several media interviews already. But she also no longer wants to sleep in her room.

This week, two major credit rating agencies downgraded Shanghai-based developer Shimao Group further into junk territory. The company has been grappling with mounting debt and is considering selling some properties to reduce its debt load. ""Shimao's liquidity has significantly deteriorated -- the decline is worse than we previously anticipated,"" said S&P Global Ratings, which cut the company's credit rating to B-. Just two months ago, S&P was still rating Shimao as investment grade. Moody's on Monday cut Shimao's rating to B2 citing ""elevated"" liquidity risks, Over the weekend, the Chinese media outlet On Tuesday, Shimao denied in a Hong Kong stock exchange But it acknowledged that it is in discussions with potential buyers about some asset The company ""may consider disposing of certain properties if the terms and conditions are appropriate,"" it added. The pressure on Shimao marks yet another snag for Chinese real estate, which has been in crisis for a while. The crunch began in 2020, when Beijing Evergrande has since been labeled a defaulter by Fitch Ratings after appearing to miss paying some financial obligations last month. Shimao was Shares of Shimao Group have tumbled more than 20% in the past month. Shimao Group has a large number of debt maturities due in 2022, including $1.7 billion worth of offshore bonds, 8.9 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) worth of onshore bonds, and ""sizable"" offshore bank loans, according to Moody's.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/25/europe/ukraine-nato-russia-coverage-tv-media-cmd-intl/index.html,"CNN Foreign forces bristling with weapons are rolling toward the Ukrainian border. Reconnaissance planes streak overhead. Rumors of ""false flag"" operations run rampant. If you're watching state TV in Moscow, you're seeing video of troops and tanks, barbed wire and snipers taking aim, but it's not Russia's forces that are poised for attack - it's NATO's. Welcome to Russia's mirror-image depiction of the showdown over Ukraine. In the country's alternate media landscape, NATO forces are carrying out a plan that's been in the works for years: Encircle Russia, topple President Vladimir Putin and seize control of Russia's energy resources. In Moscow's view, repeated in nearly every newscast and talk show, Ukraine is a failed state entirely controlled by the ""puppet master"" - the United States. Europe is a weak and divided collection of lap dogs taking orders from Washington. Even the US, as frighteningly threatening as it is, is weak and divided too, torn apart by political division and racial unrest. But wait. How can those powers be a threat - and be weak at the same time? That's one of the conundrums of Russian state propaganda. Thinking things through isn't what they're trying to encourage. Rather they're trying to raise the blood pressure of their viewers - and to make them very afraid. Russian state TV's flagship political news show, Dmitry Kiselyov's ""Vesti Nedeli"" (""News of the Week""), Any hint of disagreement between Europe and the US or NATO is headline news in Russia, and one of the top stories on Kiselyov's show featured comments by Ukraine may not be caught up in a full-blown invasion for now, but there is already an all-out war of words in Russian media. US government statements are dismissed as comments from the ""Ministry of Information,"" and Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov has accused Washington of ""information hysterics,"" ""lies"" and ""fakes."" (The word ""fake"" is now a Russian word, pronounced pretty much the same as the English.) And maps on Russian state TV showing Russia's ally Belarus surrounded by NATO forces bear an uncanny resemblance to maps in Western media reports showing Ukraine surrounded on three sides by Russian troops. Accusations of possible Russian attacks on Ukraine are dismissed as the ""half-mythological threat from Russia"" or as ""Russophobia"" from the ""Anglo-Saxons."" Tensions aren't high because of Russia, the Kremlin says - it's because of NATO. In a striking piece of mirror-image propaganda, Russian TV has taken to re-broadcasting, with translation, comments by Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson, whose anti-NATO and anti-US President Joe Biden screeds neatly align with the Kremlin's line. ""He [Carlson] ought to be on your show!"" one guest on a Russian talk show told the anchor. The state media blitz seems to be having an effect. A December poll by the non-governmental polling and sociological research organization the Levada-Center, showed that The poll found that slightly more than half of Russians believe the crisis in Ukraine will not escalate into a war between Russia and Ukraine, with more than a third (39%) saying that they think war is ""inevitable,"" or ""very likely."" A quarter of respondents said they think a war is possible between Russia and NATO. In another poll from Levada-Center, also from December, more than half of respondents (56%) said Many Russians think they're being dragged into a war by the West, ""Russia will have to respond ... We are being pinched from all sides; they're biting us. What are we supposed to do? Give in?"" one focus group respondent said. Meanwhile, Levada-Center pollsters say Russians are ""mentally fatigued"" by the topic of Ukraine which, they say, ""seems to be imposed by major media outlets."" As a result, viewers don't analyze the news or double-check what they hear from TV show hosts. To be sure, the Russian media landscape is shifting, as a younger generation goes online to get information. But most alternative news outlets in Russia have been shut down or marginalized - and the Kremlin's parallel reality continues to dominate the airwaves.

A former Israeli lawmaker, Talab Al-Sanee, said Al-Osaibi was killed after he tried to intervene when he saw Israeli police and border guards assaulting a young Palestinian woman. Israeli police said the man had grabbed a gun from a police officer who had stopped him for questioning and managed to fire two shots before he was killed by police. Social media video apparently filmed at the time of the incident captured the sound of at least 11 gunshots - the first one followed almost immediately by nine in quick succession, then another one after a moment's pause. Al-Osaibi's family asked police to release security camera footage of the incident to prove ""the allegations that their son pulled a soldier's weapon.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/10/china/china-covid-tianjin-omicron-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Officials in Beijing are on high alert just weeks out from the start of the Tianjin, located just 80 miles southeast of Beijing, is testing its entire population of 14 million people after Omicron was detected in at least two local residents Saturday - the country's first reported community spread of the highly transmittable variant. The city reported at least 40 positive cases over the weekend, including 24 children, though health authorities have yet to confirm whether they are infected with Omicron. Tianjin authorities But the virus has already spread far outside the city. State media Genome sequencing of the virus found that it belongs to the same transmission chain as the Tianjin outbreak, according to Henan health authorities. A university student who returned to Anyang from Tianjin on December 28 is believed to have brought back the virus - suggesting the variant has already been spreading in Tianjin for nearly two weeks, at the least. That is particularly worrying news to officials in Beijing, which is fewer than 30 minutes away from Tianjin by high-speed rail. In recent months, Chinese authorities have imposed ""It is impossible for China to return cases to zero before the Winter Olympics, because local outbreaks are springing up one after another,"" said Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. ""The only thing Beijing can do is to learn from the experience of the Tokyo Summer Games and hold the Olympics while community transmission is going on in the country,"" he said, noting that the event will be held within a tightly-sealed bubble isolated from the local community anyway. Beijing and Tianjin share a short border and In a statement Sunday, the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control advised Beijing residents not to visit Tianjin and those in Tianjin to refrain from traveling to the capital. It also asked commuters between the two cities to work from home. By Sunday evening, train tickets from Tianjin to Beijing could no longer be purchased online. The center also ordered people who arrived in Beijing from Tianjin since December 23 to report to their residential communities, employers or hotels for health monitoring and Covid tests. Those who came from high-risk areas of Tianjin are required to self-isolate at home. Keenly aware of the public health risk and political pressure, Tianjin officials Li Hongzhong, the Communist Party chief of Tianjin, is widely regarded as an Party and government organizations, state-owned companies and public institutions were ordered to take the lead in keeping their employees in Tianjin, while checkpoints were set up at the airport, highways, train stations and ports. All tutoring centers, daycare centers and vocational training centers were closed down, while universities and colleges sealed off their campuses. Tianjin is considered among China's foremost cities. It is one of only four provincial-level municipalities directly under the administration of the central government - alongside Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing. Tianjin authorities have not ordered a full lockdown that would confine all residents to their homes - the kind that was imposed in the northwestern city of Xi'an last month, which sparked an outcry over food shortages and obstructed medical access. Such a move would be politically fraught and economically damaging - Tianjin is a major port and economic hub, and a stringent citywide lockdown in the lead-up to the Lunar New Year could risk sparking resentment among residents. But news about the cases and travel restrictions already sparked panic buying over the weekend, with residents snapping up groceries and other critical supplies at supermarkets. The Omicron variant is the latest challenge to China's zero-Covid policy. For months, Chinese authorities have tried to keep it outside the country's tightly controlled borders through rigorous testing and lengthy quarantine for international arrivals. Tianjin was the first city in mainland China to detect an imported case of Omicron - in an asymptomatic traveler who arrived from overseas on December 13. Since then, the southern cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha and the eastern province of Zhejiang have all detected imported Omicron cases. Jin, the expert at the University of Hong Kong, said the Omicron outbreak in Tianjin is to some extent expected, as it is virtually impossible for border controls to be completely watertight against the variant. Compared to the Delta variant, Omicron poses an even bigger challenge as it spreads faster and is harder to detect, due to its lower viral load, Jin said. ""Even if Tianjin completes its citywide testing, it might not be able to identify all the cases in the city,"" he said.",Beijing on high alert as China's first Omicron cluster edges closer weeks before the Olympics

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/13/politics/object-shot-down-lake-huron-what-matters/index.html,"CNN It's been a busy weekend for US fighter jets. The US military shot down another high altitude object over Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon, the Pentagon said. Another unidentified object was shot down over northern On Friday, an unidentified object was shot down in Alaska airspace by a US F-22. And last weekend, a Chinese surveillance balloon was taken down by F-22s off the coast of South Carolina. That marks the beginning and the end of what we know definitively. Here's everything we still don't know, and some of the things we do. Are the latest objects related to China's spy balloon? There's no indication at this point whether the unidentified objects have any connection to China's surveillance balloon. Canadian retired Maj. Gen. Scott Clancy, former director of operations at NORAD and former deputy commander of the Alaskan NORAD Region, said on Monday he does not believe China is behind the unidentified objects that have been shot down in recent days. He explained that it could be a ""confluence of a distinctive activity by our adversaries to test the systems."" ""It smells to me, as the guy who was directed to conduct operations to defend North America, I'd be very suspicious,"" Clancy said on ""CNN This Morning."" ""And I'd be on high alert to make sure that all of our adversaries are being countered."" Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Hemispheric Affairs, Melissa Dalton told reporters on Sunday they were taken down out of an ""abundance of caution."" Dalton said that high-altitude objects can be used by a range of companies, countries, and research organizations for ""purposes that are not nefarious, including legitimate research."" ""The spy balloon from the PRC was of course different in that we knew precisely what was,"" she said. ""These most recent objects do not pose a kinetic military threat, but their path in proximity to sensitive DoD sites, and the altitude that they were flying could be a hazard to civilian aviation and thus raised concerns."" Are these all balloons? It's still unclear, but we're not dealing with aliens. During a midday briefing on Monday, the White House ""I just wanted to make sure we address this from the White House: I know there have been questions and concerns about this but there is no - again, no - indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent take-downs,"" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. A US official told CNN there has been caution inside the Biden administration on the pilot descriptions of the unidentified objects shot down over Alaska and Canada due to the circumstances in which the objects were viewed. But at least two high-ranking officials have made reference to balloons. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABC News that he was briefed on the object by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and that the object shot down over Canada was likely another balloon - as was the high-altitude object downed over Alaska on Friday. Canada's chief of defense staff, Gen. Wayne Eyre, also made mention of a ""balloon"" when describing instructions given to the team that worked to take down the object. A Pentagon memo sent to lawmakers and The object crossed near ""US sensitive sites"" before it was shot down, the Monday memo said. Still, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh noted Sunday ""these objects shot down on Friday and Saturday were objects and did not closely resemble the PRC balloon. When we can recover the debris, we will have more for you."" Why are these objects being spotted now? Notably, the US intelligence community's method to track China's fleet of surveillance balloons was only discovered within the last year, six people familiar with the matter told CNN. The findings have allowed the US to develop a consistent technical method for the first time, which they have used to track the balloons in near-real time across the globe, the sources said. The revelation that the intelligence community only within the last year developed a reliable way to track China's balloon fleet - which officials now say has flown dozens of missions worldwide - helps explain why Trump administration officials have stridently claimed to have had no knowledge of the three alleged flights over US territory during the former president's time in office. In other words, it's possible that it's not so much the objects that are new, but our ability to track them. And, as CNN's Natasha Bertrand reported Sunday, NORAD command recently readjusted its filters to better spot slow-moving targets operating above a certain altitude. ""In light of the People's Republic of China balloon that we took down last Saturday, we have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we detected over the past week,"" Dalton said. China has accused the US of ""illegally"" flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace more than 10 times since January 2022. The White House responded to those claims by saying the allegation is false. ""Any claim that the US government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false. It is China that has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program for intelligence collection, that it has used to violate the sovereignty of the US and over 40 countries across 5 continents,"" a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, How large is the Chinese surveillance operation? It's still unclear, but it appears to be quite large. Since news broke last week about the Chinese balloon that was floating over US airspace, new details have emerged about what's now understood to be a global surveillance operation by China's military, the People's Liberation Army. On Thursday, officials revealed that they believe the spy balloons the US has discovered are part of a large fleet that is conducting surveillance operations globally. The US has traced the balloons to 40 countries across five continents. Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, the commander of US Air Forces Central, said on Monday Chinese surveillance balloons have been spotted in the Middle East over the last few years. The balloons didn't fly over Americans bases, Grynkewich said, recalling the latest instance in which a balloon ""primarily stayed out over the water."" Was the object shot down on Sunday like the others? A US F-16 fighter jet ""We did not assess it to be a kinetic military threat to anything on the ground, but assess it was a safety flight hazard and a threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities. Our team will now work to recover the object in an effort to learn more,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said. The object was flying at 20,000 feet over Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a senior administration official told CNN on Sunday. It was ""octagonal"" with strings hanging off and no discernible payload, according to the official and another source briefed on the matter. CNN reported earlier that Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said she received a call from the Department of Defense saying the US military ""has an extremely close eye"" on an object above Lake Huron. ""Just got a call from @DeptofDefense -- our military has an extremely close eye on the object above Lake Huron,"" Slotkin said in a tweet on Sunday. ""We'll know more about what this was in the coming days, but for now, be assured that all parties have been laser-focused on it from the moment it traversed our waters."" Unanswered questions Lawmakers on Capitol Hill want answers. All senators will get a classified briefing Wednesday on China, according to a Senate aide.

https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/asia/us-navy-chief-china-pla-advantages-intl-hnk-ml/index.html,"CNN China's navy has significant advantages over its US rival, including a bigger fleet and greater shipbuilding capacity, as Beijing seeks to project its power across the oceans, the head of the United States Navy said Tuesday. Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said China ""consistently attempts to violate the maritime sovereignty and economic well-being of other nations including our allies in the South China Sea and elsewhere."" ""They got a larger fleet now so they're deploying that fleet globally,"" he said, adding that Washington must upgrade the US fleet in response. ""We do need a larger Navy, we do need more ships in the future, more modern ships in the future, in particular that can meet that threat,"" he said. China's People's Liberation Army Navy could be fielding up to 400 ships in the coming years, the Navy secretary said - up from about 340 now. Meanwhile, the US fleet sits at under 300 ships. According to the US Navy's Navigation Plan 2022 released last summer, the Pentagon's goal is to have 350 manned ships by 2045 - still well short of the projection for China's fleet. Before that target is met, however, the US fleet is expected to shrink as older vessels are retired, according to a November report from the US Congressional Budget Office. Del Toro's claims Del Toro said Tuesday that US naval shipyards can't match the output of Chinese ones. As with fleet size, it's about numbers. ""They have 13 shipyards, in some cases their shipyard has more capacity - one shipyard has more capacity than all of our shipyards combined. That presents a real threat,"" he claimed. Del Toro did not give a breakdown of those shipyards, but Chinese and Western reports say China has six major and two smaller shipyards building naval vessels. In the US, seven shipyards produce large and deep draft ships for the US Navy and Coast Guard, according to an October report from Brent Sadler at the Center for National Defense. But no matter the number of shipyards, they need workers, and Del Toro says China has a numerical advantage there, largely because it is free of the restrictions, regulations and economic pressures that affect labor in the US. One big US problem is finding skilled labor, he said. ""[W]hen you have unemployment at less than 4%, it makes it a real challenge whether you're trying to find workers for a restaurant or you're trying to find workers for a shipyard,"" the Navy leader said. He also said China can do things the US can't. ""They're a communist country, they don't have rules by which they abide by,"" he said. ""They use slave labor in building their ships, right - that's not the way we should do business ever, but that's what we're up against so it does present a significant advantage,"" he claimed. CNN has reached out to China's Foreign Ministry for reaction to Del Toro's allegations. US advantages Del Toro did not supply specifics to support the slave labor allegation, and analysts expressed doubt that Beijing would resort to such a tactic. ""China has a very large pool of available manpower and it wouldn't really make sense to use slave labor in a high-tech sector vital to their national security,"" said Blake Herzinger, a nonresident fellow and Indo-Pacific defense policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute. Herzinger said comments like that from the Navy chief are indicative of a pattern where US attention is put in the wrong place - to the detriment of US abilities. ""This seems unfortunately common, that Navy leadership throws stones at real or imagined faults in Chinese shipbuilding rather than reckoning with US failures over two decades to conceptualize, design and build ships for its own navy,"" Herzinger said. According to a US Congressional Research Service report from November, the US Navy has taken steps to address the gap with China, including assigning more of its fleet to the Pacific and using newer and more capable ships in Pacific roles. And Del Toro said Tuesday that the US retains one big advantage over China - ""our people."" ""In many ways our shipbuilders are better shipbuilders, that's why we have a more modern, more capable, more lethal Navy than they do,"" he said. US military personnel are better on their feet, too, Del Toro contended. ""They script their people to fight, we actually train our people to think,"" he said. ""There's a fundamental difference in how we train our Marines and our sailors and our soldiers and our airmen and our Space Force in this country that gives us an inherent advantage over anything the Chinese can put up.""","US can't keep up with China's warship building, Navy Secretary says"

Bills for households and businesses are already soaring, ""We've seen huge price increases,"" said Dimitri Vergne, head of the energy team at The European Consumer Organization. ""It's worrying ahead of the winter, when gas consumption will necessarily increase."" A complex web of factors is at play. A cold spring depleted natural gas inventories. Rebuilding stocks has been tough, thanks to an unexpected jump in demand as the economy bounces back from Covid-19 and a growing appetite for liquified natural gas (LNG) Meanwhile, other sources of power have been less readily available, with The deteriorating situation is quickly transforming into a full-blown crisis. Spain has announced emergency measures to cut energy bills, while France plans to make one-time EUR100 ($117) payments to nearly 6 million lower-income households. In the United Kingdom -- where natural gas spikes have already threatened to Industries across the region are seeing costs take off. Some British steelmakers have had to suspend operations, according to trade group UK Steel. Norway's Yara ""Right now, it's unprofitable to produce ammonia in Europe,"" said Yara CEO Svein Tore Holsether, noting that it costs $900 to produce a metric ton that sells for just $600. The company will temporarily rely on plants in other parts of the world to supply customers. The fallout could weigh on Europe's economy, while exacerbating fears about inflation at a delicate moment in the pandemic recovery. ""To the extent people are worried about the higher cost of energy, they may be inclined to hold back on spending,"" said Jessica Hinds, Europe economist at Capital Economics. What's happening The leap in natural gas prices can be traced back to a chilly spring. Cold weather through April and the beginning of May forced a drawdown in natural gas stocks during a period when demand typically eases. ""We started this whole process of putting gas away ... six weeks later than we normally would,"" said Tom Marzec-Manser, a natural gas analyst at market intelligence firm ICIS. But the problems don't end there. China has also been outbidding Europe for LNG, which is preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal as the country tries to make its economy greener. As a result, the price of power for next-day delivery in France jumped 149% between the beginning of August and Sept. 15, according to data from ICIS. In Germany, prices leaped 119%. And in Britain, which operates a just-in-time market and doesn't have the same storage capacity as continental Europe, costs have surged 298%. Delayed maintenance work, as well as a fire that shut down a power cable that transmits electricity supplies from France, has piled on the pressure. In this environment, European countries would typically turn to Russia, which meets about a third of the continent's natural gas needs. But supplies from Gazprom, the state-backed natural gas company, have been lower than usual. ""Although Russia is running production at very high levels, there are still fears it can't produce enough to satisfy Europe's very high demand,"" Wood Mackenzie analyst Graham Freedman said. ""There are concerns there may not be enough gas in [Gazprom's] storage to get through the winter."" Marzec-Manser said it's hard to pin down exactly what's happening in Russia. There were some production problems over the summer, and the country is also experiencing higher domestic demand, he said. There are also theories that Moscow is intentionally supplying less than it could Norway, which supplies about 20% of the natural gas consumed in Europe, is trying to help fill the gap. Equinor, the state energy company, announced this week that it would increase exports starting in October. But in the near-term, experts warn pressure on prices is unlikely to ease. Britain most exposed Political leaders are trying to assuage fears that the public could go without power or heat as the temperature drops. ""We do not expect supply emergencies to occur this winter,"" Kwasi Kwarteng, the UK business secretary, told Parliament on Monday. ""There is absolutely no question ... of the lights going out or people being unable to heat their homes."" But it's increasingly clear that the crisis will be costly, and could weigh on the region's economy while the effects of Covid-19 are still being felt. The situation is particularly acute in the United Kingdom, where seven small energy providers -- including Avro Energy, which supplied about 580,000 customers -- have failed in recent weeks because their costs have soared. Dozens more are on the brink. Other British industries are at risk, too. On Tuesday, the UK government said it had CF Industries ""I do not see people freezing,"" said Michael Grubb, a professor of energy and climate change at University College London. ""I do see unenviable choices, between a lot of companies going bust and who picks up the tab."" The Confederation of British Industry, a UK business lobby group, emphasized Wednesday that ""significant"" price rises hit both businesses and consumers. ""It's essential vulnerable customers and key energy intensive companies, which underpin critical UK supply chains, are well supported throughout the winter,"" Matthew Fell, the chief policy director, said in a statement. A lot rides on the weather. Henning Gloystein, director of the energy, climate and resources practice at Eurasia Group, thinks that if the next few months yield particularly cold weather, there could be further pressure on certain industries to reduce consumption of natural gas to prioritize supplies to households. ""If it gets cold this winter, [supplies] could get really tight,"" he said. ""Politically, that's really toxic."" Governments will do what they can to shield consumers from rising prices, Prices for CO2 paid by the UK food industry, for example, will go up despite the temporary subsidy to CF Industries. To what extent that gets passed on down the chain to supermarket shelves remains to be seen. ""At the moment, it definitely seems likely we'll be seeing higher inflation in the short term,"" Hinds of Capital Economics said. ""And this is probably going to run into next year."" She predicted that a previous estimate of headline inflation of 3.5% for Europe in the final months of 2021 could rise to 4%.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/30/economy/china-factories-growth-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business Factories in China are struggling at a time when the world's second largest economy has to contend with yet another concern: a A government survey of manufacturing activity released Thursday fell to 49.6 in September, down from 50.1 in August. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction -- and in this case, it was the first time the official survey showed activity shrinking since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Factories are getting dinged by the soaring cost of energy, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics, which added Thursday that high-energy businesses have not been prospering. ""The big picture is that industry was coming off the boil even prior to the latest power shortages,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a Thursday research note. A But that work requires tons of power and thus massive amounts of coal. Power shortages The worsening power crunch has triggered blackouts for households and forced factories to cut production -- a threat to the country's vast economy that could place even more strain on global supply chains. Companies in the country's industrial heartlands have been told to limit their energy consumption in order to reduce demand for power, according to state media. The problem prompted China's State Grid Corporation to say this week that it would ""go all out to fight the tough battle of power supply,"" making every effort to secure residential consumption. Evans-Pritchard noted that the latest surveys took place before most of the impact from the latest power shortages was felt. ""Since then, power shortages have intensified,"" he added, pointing out that media reports suggest factories in more than 20 provinces have had to scale back production. Thursday's data wasn't all bad. A private survey of manufacturing activity, the Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index, rose from 49.2 to 50, indicating stable levels of activity in September compared to a decline in August. And an official index of non-manufacturing business activity rose to 53.2 from August's 47.5, a sign that the services sector is recovering. Flagging consumer demand has been a concern in China this year. But the overall economic picture is troubling. Analysts at Nomura and Goldman Sachs trimmed their forecasts for Chinese growth in 2021 in recent days over the power shortage problems. The Goldman analysts noted this week that there's ""considerable uncertainty"" headed into the final quarter of the year, given that the Chinese economy already faces risks because of the debt crisis at ""There is still some scope for a further recovery in services activity as disruptions from the pandemic ease,"" Evans-Pritchard wrote.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/03/politics/biden-supreme-court-abortion-joe-manchin/index.html,"CNN Both the premise and promise of In the seven-month span of Biden's term, this is the worst of times for Democrats. A stroke-of-midnight Friday brought its own series of bad news for the President in the form of Add in the Republican Party's expanding Each of these crises is putting Biden's leadership under extreme examination and in several cases exposing his inability to meaningfully shift prevailing dynamics because of divides in his own party and Republicans' obstructive power. The President has issued stirring and even angry demands for action on voting rights and abortion rights. But a 50-50 Senate and a new conservative Supreme Court majority severely limit his options - unless he is prepared to embrace the political earthquakes of abolishing Senate filibuster obstruction rules and enlarging the nation's top bench, which he has neither the political majorities nor personal inclination to do, to the fury of progressives. The challenges facing Biden also highlight a more over-arching question about his governing philosophy. How can a President dedicated to restoring and using traditional Washington methods to pass a massive program do so when confronted by a Republican Party that has already shown itself ready to shred regular order to gain and regain power? From triumph to potential disaster The new difficulties follow a head-spinning three weeks that actually started in triumph when Biden succeeded in shepherding a bipartisan infrastructure bill and $3.5 trillion spending blueprint through the Senate. But the sequence of subsequent dramas has stretched the White House, exposed the limits of the Democrats' thin majorities and - in the case of the chaotic withdrawal from Kabul - displayed the capacity of outside events to destabilize presidencies at any moment. It's one thing for the progressive wing of the party to demand sweeping presidential action to enforce their priorities immediately. But the Democratic Party is hardly an ideological monolith. Its congressional leadership, who must be conscious of the moderate lane Biden traveled to the White House, appears to have neither the internal unity or stomach to flex power ruthlessly in the manner of rule-breaking Republicans on the filibuster and the high court. And the cumulative power of conservatism built up over years, even with Republicans currently locked out of power in Washington, is showing itself to be a formidable political force. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a master of obstruction, deploys the filibuster with aplomb and enjoys heaping pressure on moderate Democrats, every one of whose votes the President needs. And the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, by refusing to block a near-total Texas abortion ban, drove home its power to destroy liberal dreams not just now, but for years to come. Trauma over abortion decision Apart perhaps from the shock victory of Donald Trump on election night in 2016, the Texas abortion law - which bars abortion after as early as six weeks into the pregnancy and contains no exceptions for rape or incest - may be the most traumatic moment for liberals in many years. It was obvious the new Supreme Court conservative majority was gunning for Roe v. Wade. But the manner in which the justices acquiesced in the effective stripping of Constitutional rights of women in Texas in a 5-4 decision, which included no hearings or detailed arguments, was staggering. As was the fact that the Texas law, which allows anyone in the US to sue a person - doctor, family member or Uber driver, for example, who helps someone else get an abortion - appears to introduce a form of vigilante justice with grave implications for other constitutional rights. For decades, the threat to abortion was expected to come in a frontal assault on the 1973 Roe decision. Now, unless the Supreme Court reverses itself at a later date, conservative states have a formula to simply bypass the landmark legislation entirely. Biden reacted to the Supreme Court's decision with a strongly worded statement and instructed his administration to examine what options there are to guarantee a woman's right to choose in Texas. The President decried ""an unprecedented assault on a woman's constitutional rights."" Vice President Kamala Harris promised the ruling was not the ""last word"" on Roe v. Wade. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department was ""deeply concerned"" about the Texas abortion law. Garland's statement was especially ironic since had McConnell not twisted convention to deny him a Supreme Court seat in President Barack Obama's last year in office, the entire outcome of the Texas abortion episode may have been reversed. But in any case, strong statements are unlikely to change the momentum of this issue, or satisfy progressives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed to bring up a measure guaranteeing equal access to abortion as soon as the chamber returns from recess next week. She said the Texas law is ""the most extreme, dangerous abortion ban in half a century, and its purpose is to destroy Roe v. Wade."" But there are nowhere near the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass such a major piece of legislation that almost all Republicans would oppose. To overcome that barrier, Democrats would have to vote by a simple majority to change the filibuster. But Manchin, several other Democratic senators and even Biden himself have balked at such a step, partly due to fears about how a future unfettered Republican Senate and White House could swiftly remake America - perhaps in the image of anti-abortion, pro-gun Texas. Another option backed by many progressives during last year's election campaign was a scheme to simply expand the Supreme Court to counter what Democrats see as at least two illicit Republican appointments. Biden, a Washington institutionalist, whose entire political project relies on forging national unity through bipartisan measures like his infrastructure bill, has shown little interest in such a step that would ignite a political firestorm. Biden did form a commission to advise him on court reform. But it was widely seen as a way of side-stepping demands by the Democratic left for court packing. Ultimately, the Texas abortion law and the Supreme Court's refusal to stop it reflect the hangover from what seems to become a more disastrous election for Democrats in 2016 with every year that passes. Hillary Clinton's defeat paved the way for Trump to seat three new justices - Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - and the Texas abortion law is just the start. Every vote counts The Democrats' underperformance in another election, the 2020 congressional contests, are behind their other big political problem this week. Only two runoff victories in Georgia allowed Democrats to take control of the Senate in a disappointing showing since Biden did far better in unseating Trump. The resulting 50-50 majority in the Senate means that every single vote is needed to pass anything by a simple majority. Biden cannot lose even one Democrat. So Manchin's new warning that he is not just uncomfortable with the size of the $3.5 trillion dollar spending package but also the concept and the idea of passing it at the current moment threatened real trouble for Biden's domestic legacy. ""Instead of rushing to spend trillions on new government programs and additional stimulus funding, Congress should hit a strategic pause on the budget-reconciliation legislation,"" Manchin wrote in ""A pause is warranted because it will provide more clarity on the trajectory of the pandemic, and it will allow us to determine whether inflation is transitory or not."" Biden's legislative skills mean it's far too early to assume he will not be able to talk Manchin around. There have been other moments when the legislation's prospects have seemed dark. And most bills have near death moments before they pass. But the complex choreography needed for this particular measure leaves it especially vulnerable. And it's also fair to ask how low Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders and House progressives are willing to go on the size of the final package and on its timing. Not very far, if key House progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is to be believed. ""Maybe we hit the 'cancel' button on this so-called 'bipartisan' charade of an Exxon lobbyist drafted infrastructure bill unless we actually pass a law that helps people's lives with healthcare expansion, childcare, climate action, etc,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. Manchin's doubts do not just endanger a single Democratic priority. The spending blueprint is a monster that pretty much includes all of Biden's top priorities in a measure that can evade the filibuster and pass with a limited device known as reconciliation. But if Democrats can't get Manchin on board it is doomed. And this is also about more than one bill. The spending bill is part of a delicate dance designed to convince progressives like Ocasio-Cortez to back the bipartisan infrastructure measure that she mentioned. That proposed law would be a landmark of the Biden presidency but falls far short of the hopes of more liberal members.",Supreme Court and Joe Manchin tighten Biden's political straitjacket

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/22/india/india-us-china-russia-relations-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN What a difference a few weeks make. Just last month India was taking flak from the West for its relationship with Russia. Not only was the South Asian country refusing to condemn Moscow's brutal assault on Ukraine, but its purchases of discounted Russian oil - said critics - were flying in the face of sanctions aimed at crippling the Kremlin's finances. And the White House was making its displeasure clear, calling New Delhi ""somewhat shaky"" and speaking of its ""disappointment."" Then all of a sudden, the West's tune changed. When Biden met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month, it was all diplomatic backslapping and soundbites about ""a deep connection between our people"" and ""shared values."" Then on Friday British leader Boris Johnson flew into Delhi to talk up trade ties and pose for costumed photo ops, all while glossing over ""differences"" regarding Russia. Yet India's stance on Ukraine remains largely the same. It is still buying cheap Russian oil - in fact, it has bought nearly as much in the first months of 2022 as it did in whole of 2021, India, analysts say, just taught the West a masterclass in international diplomacy. With India vital to US efforts to counter the rise of China - seen by the US as potentially an even bigger threat to world peace than Russia - the West needed to bite its tongue. Or as Harsh V. Pant, a professor in international relations at King's College London, put it, the United States realized it needed to treat India as a ""new partner that needs to be wooed."" Why is India vital to the US? Both New Delhi and Washington are becoming increasingly uneasy over China's growing Under President Xi Jinping, China's military - the People's Liberation Army - has grown to field Part of Washington's plan to counter this rests with India's inclusion - alongside the US, Japan and Australia - in the increasingly active security grouping known as the Quad, said Pant, who is also head of the Strategic Studies Program at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Meanwhile, India has its own concerns with China. The two countries have been engaged in a military standoff along their shared Himalayan border that has claimed dozens of lives in the past couple of years. And, in an irony that won't have been lost on Washington, India relies heavily on Russian arms to equip its military - including in the Himalayas. Shared concerns over Chinese aggression were made clear after the Biden-Modi meeting, when US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned China was seeking to ""refashion the region and the international system"" and said the US and India had ""identified new opportunities to extend the operational reach of our militaries."" It was a sign that - whatever their differences over Ukraine - the two countries had a deep ""understanding of each other's positions,"" said Manoj Kewalramani, a fellow of China studies at the Takshashila Institution in India. Vocal on China, silent on India These concerns help explain why Washington continues to criticize China's silence on Russia's actions in Ukraine, even as it turns quiet on India's. Superficially, at least, India and China appear to have similar positions on the Ukraine war. Both have positioned themselves as neutral onlookers - rather than vocal opponents - both have called for peace and both have refused to condemn the invasion outright. And both have strategic relationships with Russia that they are keen not to jeopardize. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin declared in February their relationship had ""no limits,"" while on some estimates India gets more than 50% of its military equipment from Russia. But these similarities are only superficial. In fact, there are ""vast differences,"" according to Kewalramani. China has decried Western sanctions and India on the other hand has steered clear of criticizing NATO and appears keen to downplay its differences with the US. There have also been subtle shifts in India's position as the war has progressed. Modi had talked to Ukrainian President President Volodymyr Zelensky, while China's leaders hadn't, pointed out Li Mingjiang, associate professor in international relations at Nanyang Technological University's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. India had also been harsher in its criticism of alleged Russian war crimes, Li said. This month, India's ambassador to the United Nations called the killings of civilians in Bucha ""deeply disturbing,"" condemning them and calling for an open investigation. Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun on the other hand said the deaths were ""deeply disturbing,"" but stopped short of attributing blame and urged ""all sides"" to ""avoid unfounded accusations."" Significantly, after the Biden-Modi talks, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted India's condemnation of ""killing of civilians in Ukraine"" and its provision of ""humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine."" A complicated relationship The US may also be recognizing that India's relationship with Russia has historically followed a very different course to that of the West. Blinken noted that India's ties with Russia had ""developed over decades, at a time when the United States was not able to be a partner to India."" That appeared to be a reference to the Cold War between the US and the USSR - during which India was officially nonaligned. However, India began to lean towards the USSR in the 1970s when the US began providing military and financial assistance to its neighbor, Pakistan. This was when Russia started providing arms to India, and India remains heavily reliant on Russia for military equipment to this day. In 2018 India inked a $5 billion weapons deal with Russia for an air defense missile system, despite the deal potentially putting it in the crosshairs of Washington's Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, a federal law passed in 2017 which imposed new sanctions on Iran, Russia and North Korea. India's dependence on Russian arms limits its ability to denounce Moscow's actions in Ukraine. When Putin visited Delhi last December, Modi even called Putin a ""dear friend."" 'Wooed by all sides' All this has led to a position in which India is being ""wooed by all sides,"" Pant said. Moscow remains onside, and remains keen to sell India discounted oil. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov even met his counterpart in Delhi this month and praised India for not looking at the Ukraine war ""in a one-sided way."" And onside too is the West, ties with which have been growing ever closer since Modi's election in 2014. Annual India-US trade is more than $110 billion, compared to India's trade with Russia, which amounts to about $8 billion. In recent years, India has also become a major customer for US military equipment. Even so, at Biden's meeting with Modi there remained a hint of unease. The US President urged his Indian counterpart not to step up his country's use of Russian oil, instead offering to help him acquire oil from elsewhere. India, which imports 80% of its oil needs, gets no more than 3% from Russia. So it appears India has managed to pull off an impressive balancing act.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/07/china/china-xian-outbreak-analysis-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN As Xi'an was placed under strict lockdown orders on December 23 in a drastic bid to contain the spread of a fast-growing Covid cluster. But in the days and weeks since, a steady stream of complaints about food shortages, as well as heartbreaking scenes of critical patients - including heavily pregnant women - being denied medical care have shocked the nation. Many were reminded of the traumatic early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, the original epicenter where 11 million residents were confined to their homes for months in 2020. Back then, Wuhan was blighted by China has since relied on a combination of mass testing, snap lockdowns and extensive quarantine measures to stamp out renewed flare-ups. This zero-Covid strategy has successfully protected the country against the worst of the pandemic, potentially saving millions of lives and winning overwhelming public support. To date, China has only officially reported The ruling Communist Party has held up that success as proof its one-party, authoritarian political model is superior to Western democracies, which have struggled to control their outbreaks. But by the same token, the tragedies unfolding in Xi'an also stem from the same top-down political system, which demands absolute loyalty, brooks no dissent and places the interests of the whole far above the rights of individuals. With Beijing bent on achieving its zero-Covid goal, local officials often pledge to do ""whatever it costs"" to return cases to zero - causing great disruption to daily life and at times even harming those they are supposed to protect. ""No one cares what you die of - other than Covid-19,"" a user wrote on Chinese social media this week. Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, describes the phenomenon as ""toxic politics."" ""Over the past decades, public policy process - in terms of agenda setting, policy formulation and implementation - in China has continued to be top-down, non-participatory, impromptu and mobilizational,"" he said. ""That has facilitated the local leaders to impose those policy measures to society, which essentially is not in a position to negotiate with the state in policy-making and implementation."" In a way, Xi'an's dysfunction is not an exception. Complaints of disproportionately harsh measures abound during previous prolonged lockdowns in other comparatively smaller areas, from cities in the western region of Xinjiang to the southern border town of Ruili. But in Xi'an, such problems took place in a much more extreme form, on a much larger scale, and garnered much wider attention. ""People like to use Shanghai as a sort of reference point,"" Huang said, referring to the Chinese financial center widely praised for its cool-headed and targeted Covid response. ""But they forgot that Shanghai is actually a rare case due to its relatively strong bureaucratic capacity."" ""When the capacity is low, government officials are more likely to turn to heavy-handed, indiscriminate and even excessive measures that significantly raise the cost of implementing this (zero-Covid) strategy,"" he said, citing Xi'an as an example. Over the past week, Xi'an authorities have faced a public outcry over draconian lockdown measures that prevented critical patients from urgent medical care. A heavily pregnant woman allegedly miscarried on New Year's Day after being denied entry by a hospital because she didn't have a valid Covid test. A young woman claimed she lost her father to a heart attack following much-delayed rescue, after they were turned down by hospitals for coming from a ""medium-risk area"" of the city. In an ""The guard said he was doing his job; The nurse said she was doing her job; The hospital said it was doing its job. From the perspective of all the epidemic prevention and control requirements, nobody was at fault. So who does the problem lie with?"" she asked. To quell public fury, the Chinese Communist Party moved quickly to announce a flurry of punishments: hospital managers were suspended or removed from posts, while the city's key public health officials were issued disciplinary warnings. At a news conference Thursday, Liu Shunzhi, the head of the Xi'an Municipal Health Commission, bowed and apologized to the woman who lost her child, as well as other patients who had problems accessing medical treatment. And the upper echelon of the party weighed in too. Sun Chunlan, a Politburo member and vice premier overseeing China's Covid response, ""We're deeply saddened and sorry to see such problems occur, which has exposed the sloppiness in prevention and control work, and the lesson is profound,"" Sun was quoted as saying by state media. ""The original purpose of epidemic prevention and control is to keep people healthy and safeguard lives."" In blaming local officials for failing to do their job well, Sun brushed over a deeper root cause that drove Xi'an authorities to such extremes in implementing the lockdown - namely the tremendous political pressure to achieve the central government's zero-Covid goal. Across China, hundreds of local officials have been fired or punished for failing to contain Covid flare-ups in their localities. With the Lunar New Year and the Beijing Winter Olympics fast approaching, such pressure has only intensified. Meanwhile, China's political system has become even more top-down under President Xi Jinping, who has demanded absolute loyalty from the vast bureaucracy. Local governments are required to always toe the line of the central party leadership and carry out its instructions to the letter. As a result, the room for healthy policy debates and flexibility in implementation has shrunk drastically. Also rapidly shrinking is China's press freedom and civil society, which could have potentially alerted a crisis early on. Even during the initial outbreak in Wuhan, some relatively outspoken state media outlets published hard-hitting reports and successfully drew attention to problems on the ground, while citizens across China organized themselves to help those in need. But the space for independent reporting and social organization has been further squeezed over the past two years, as a wave of nationalism engulfs the country. During previous outbreaks, when voices of criticism against harsh lockdown measures arose online, they were often met with admonishment to ""think about the bigger picture,"" namely the country's zero-Covid ambitions. But since the Xi'an lockdown, more are starting to reflect on the sacrifices individuals are asked to make - and whether they are worth it. Zhang Wenmin, a former investigative journalist who lives in Xi'an, publicly questioned the official slogan ""we must do it at all cost."" ""It may sound all well and good, but when zooming in more specifically on the individual level, as an ordinary person, we might want to ask: are we the 'we' here, or are we the 'cost' that must be paid?"" she asked in a ""In this world, nobody is an island, the death of any individual is a death of all,"" she wrote. ""The virus didn't take any lives in this city, but there is a real possibility that other things did.""",What Xi'an's chaotic lockdown reveals about China's uncompromising top-down bureaucracy
https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/26/middleeast/israel-raid-jenin-west-bank-intl/index.html,"CNN Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians and wounded several others in the Hours after the Jenin raid, a tenth Palestinian was killed in what Israel Police called a ""violent disturbance"" near Jerusalem. The death toll makes Thursday the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year, according to CNN records.  It brings the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces this year to 30, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health figures. That toll includes militants being targeted in Israeli raids, individuals who attacked Israelis, and bystanders, CNN reporting shows. Nine Palestinians, including an elderly woman, were killed during an Israeli raid of the Jenin refugee camp, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. Israeli security forces said they were operating in Jenin Thursday to apprehend a ""terror squad belonging to the Islamic Jihad terror organization,"" saying in a statement that it killed three ""terrorists."" ""The Islamic Jihad terror operatives were heavily involved in executing and planning multiple major terror attacks, including shooting attacks on IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians,"" the joint statement from the Israel Defense Forces, Israel Security Agency and Border Police said. The statement said two armed suspects were ""neutralized"" while fleeing and that a third was neutralized at the scene. Another suspect surrendered, they said. Israeli forces reported no injuries on their side, but said they were aware of ""claims regarding additional casualties during the exchange of fire"" and were investigating. The Palestinian Red Crescent (PRC) said Israeli forces initially prevented medics from entering Jenin camp, making it difficult to reach injured individuals, four of whom were in critical condition. The PRC said Israeli forces also fired tear gas canisters towards the Jenin Government Hospital, causing inhalation injuries among children. Later on Thursday, a 22-year-old Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli troops in Al-Ram near Jerusalem, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said, making him the tenth Palestinian killed that day. Israel Border Police said they were responding to a ""violent disturbance"" in the city and that ""a terrorist who shot fireworks from a short range at our forces ""was neutralized."" The force said in a statement that one of its officers had also fired at and hit a second person who allegedly shot fireworks at them. On Friday Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Twitter he had informed his security teams to ""prepare for action with a variety of offensive measures and high-quality targets, in case it is necessary to continue to act - until peace is restored to the citizens of Israel."" The militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) on Friday has taken responsibility for firing rockets towards Israel overnight Thursday, the leader of the group in Gaza, Sheikh Khaled Al-Batsh, told crowds. Al-Batsh said Friday that the PIJ's armed wing, Al-Quds Brigades, fired rockets in response to the deadly raids in Jenin by the Israeli Defense Forces, while Hamas' armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, ""fired anti-aircraft missiles at Israeli planes that raided sites in the Strip."" ""The plot today aims to allow the enemy to swallow the West Bank, build settlements and annex lands, to gradually impose its alleged policy, as happened in the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and all areas that are subject to settlement,"" Al-Batsh said in Gaza. The group also said ""the way to restore rights and dignity and expel the occupation is through fighting only."" Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh has called on the United Nations and international human rights organizations to ""intervene urgently to provide protection ... and stop the bloodshed of children, youth and women."" The Palestinian Authority also announced it will cease security coordination with Israel starting immediately, its Deputy Prime Minister Nabil Abu Rudineh told a news conference in Ramallah in the wake of the raid. ""In light of the repeated aggression against our people and the flouting of the signed agreements, including security ones, we consider that security coordination with the Israeli occupation government no longer exists as of now,"" Abu Rudineh said. The Islamic Jihad welcomed the Palestinian's Authority's decision to cancel the security coordination with Israel, and urged Arab countries to stop the normalization of relations with Israel. Coordination between Israel and the Palestinians involves a range of civilian and security matters, including sharing of some intelligence for security operations targeting militant groups - seen as key to preventing terror attacks. But Palestinian Authority leadership has come under pressure to cut the coordination, especially over the past year which has seen some of the highest levels of violence and death for both Palestinians and Israelis in years. The Palestinian Authority previously suspended security coordination for several months in 2020, after Israel announced plans to annex parts of the West Bank as part of former President Donald Trump's peace plan. The annexation did not proceed and security coordination resumed. Last year was the deadliest for both Palestinians in the West Bank and for Israelis in nearly two decades, CNN analysis of official statistics on both sides showed. Israel's top military officer told CNN ""fighting terrorism is a complex mission,"" in the wake of Thursday's fatal Israeli raid. Herzi Halevi, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff, was speaking to CNN's Hadas Gold shortly after the raid, and before he had been fully briefed on it. An IDF spokesperson later told CNN the military was responding to intelligence about an imminent attack. ""We went into Jenin in daylight,"" the spokesperson said, underlining that the decision to operate in daylight rather than overnight, as the IDF usually does, shows how ""urgent"" the mission was. When the forces arrived at the targeted building they ""came under heavy fire and returned fire."" The suspects were barricaded in a house when the IDF arrived, ""so in addition the forces used an anti-tank shoulder-fired missile."" ""We are aware of reports a woman in her 60s, to our sorrow, was killed during the operation. We do not yet know on whom to assign responsibility, who fired and where she was,"" the spokesperson added. Israel is increasing its defensive posture against Palestinian militant attacks in the wake of the raid, the Ministry of Defense said. The Israeli Defense Forces told CNN on Friday that Gaza militants fired seven rockets towards Israel overnight Thursday that entered Israeli air space. Four were intercepted and three exploded in an open area, the IDF said, adding that several more had been launched but exploded inside the Gaza Strip. Israel said earlier that in response to the rockets from Gaza, it launched air strikes targeting an ""underground rocket manufacturing site belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in Maghazi in the central Gaza Strip."" ""This strike will significantly impede Hamas' intensification and armament efforts,"" it said in a statement posted on the force's official Telegram channel.",Lethal Israeli raid marks deadliest day in over a year
https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/23/opinions/ukraine-russia-daily-impact-markovic/index.html,"CNN Those of us who live in Ukraine have anxiously But Ukraine has already been at war for nearly eight years. In 2014, I clearly remember my last trip to Donetsk in May 2014 as a staff member of the Organization of Security and Co-operation in Europe Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (OSCE/SMM). There were occasional shootouts in the city, and our security protocol forbade us from leaving the hotel. When it was time to leave, our brand-new armored truck brought us to the once-posh Donetsk airport, which had become an empty and gloomy place. There were only a few passengers among men in unidentified uniforms and a tank nestled in a flowerbed, pointing its muzzle at the departing planes. We got to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv safe and sound, but a few days later, Donetsk airport became the backdrop of a deadly battle between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukrainian army. Back in 2014, it was perfectly clear what was happening in the Donbas region along the Ukrainian border was staying there. The Ukrainian military localized the war, so most civilians (except for those living near the battlefield) did not feel the effects. Odesa beaches, Kyiv restaurants and Carpathian ski resorts functioned as usual. Yet, for many, including myself, it was obvious that the Donbas situation was like a deep wound covered with just a band-aid - you might not be able to see it, but if it's not properly addressed, it can cost your life. Now, in 2022, it has suddenly dawned on everyone in Ukraine that war can break out beyond the Donbas region and disrupt everyday life in the rest of the country. According to the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, if there is a rifle on the wall in the first chapter, it must go off in the second or third one. And here we deal with not just one rifle, but as many as This military build-up that was perceived as mere chatter a couple of months ago has since become a resounding alarm bell for Ukrainian society. Ironically, the alarm was raised by foreign diplomats, politicians and media while the Ukrainian political establishment was slow to recognize the threat. Among my circle of journalists, civil activists, academics and a couple of oppositional politicians was a desperate search for answers to a very crucial question: What should we do as citizens if Russia attacks? The recent answer that finally came from the Ukrainian president didn't really help. On January 19, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an actor who played a president on TV before he entered politics, Kharkiv is not the only With no adequate top-down communication, many citizens choose to follow commonsense survival rules: stocking up on food and setting up meeting points with their loved ones in case communication is down. Local authorities are auditing their emergency capacities and test warning systems. Last month, Kyiv city authorities and the State Emergency Service The key facility designed to be a mass shelter in case of air strikes is the underground infrastructure of the Kyiv subway. Yet, its capacity is limited to ""hosting"" about Those who are not lucky enough to get to the subway would have to take shelter in places such as underground parking lots, the cellars of condominiums and other public and commercial property. Some cellars designated as bomb shelters in 2014-2015 were later repurposed for civilian use to operate as bomb shelters in case of an emergency. But a friend told me a cellar in her building that was supposed to be earlier designated as a shelter was rented out and now hosts a cafe, while another designated shelter in my neighborhood was completely demolished during a construction project. People admit the uncertainty and the lack of clear emergency instructions are draining their intellectual and emotional resources, making it hard to focus on current tasks and their ability to make long-term plans. Yet, denial would be even more harmful. This whole situation reminds me of an episode from Julian Barnes' novel, ""The Noise of Time,"" a fictionalized biography of the famous Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Amidst a KGB hunt on intelligentsia, Barnes wrote Shostakovich was pretty much sure he would be arrested. So, every night (usually the KGB conducted arrests in the middle of the night, to catch people off-guard), he would pack a small suitcase and stand in front of the elevator for hours, waiting for the KGB to come after him. He even thought of bringing a chair to make his wait more comfortable. Every time he heard the elevator noise his heart would jump out, but when the elevator stopped at another floor, he would come to his senses and go back home with his suitcase. Until the next night. People in Ukraine right now are collectively acting like Shostakovich: They can't help but be alert, even if they are exhausted by it, while Vladimir Putin himself acts like the KGB.","In Ukraine, one question looms: What will we do if Russia attacks?"
https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html,"CNN  Ukraine has warned that The Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine - including increased weapons supplies and military training - constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank. The picture is complicated - but here's a breakdown of what we know. What's the situation on the border? The United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as ""unusual."" As many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from Speaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had ""ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine's border, which it In late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware - including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles - on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest The assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution. US officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two. Many of Russia's military bases are to the west of the vast country - the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia's Defense Ministry has said it is conducting ""regular"" winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as ""temporarily occupied territories,"" although Russia denies it. The front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists. Russia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia. What's the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? Tensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, Then, in March 2014, Russia Shortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kyiv, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kyiv and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations.  The European Union and US have The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country's east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement. What's Russia's view? The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm. Moscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO - in terms of weaponry, training and personnel - as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia's borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances. Putin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a ""red line"" for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. ""And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,"" he said. If the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, What is Ukraine's view? Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion. ""Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,"" it added. Ukraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia's plan ahead of a military invasion. ""External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,"" he said. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. At the same time, Zelensky's government faces challenges on many fronts. The government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy. Many people are also unhappy that the government hasn't yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country's east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kyiv. In a January 19 video address, Zelensky urged the Ukrainian people to ""calm down"" amid mounting unease over a possible Russian invasion. ""We are aware of everything, we are ready for everything,"" he said, before adding that he ""sincerely believes"" this year ""will pass without a war"" with Russia. Kuleba also sought to reassure Ukrainians who fear the US, its NATO allies and Russia could leave Kyiv out of discussions. ""No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine is a principle that we adhere to,"" he said. What does NATO say? NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said ""there will be a high price to pay for Russia"" if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner. ""We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,"" said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses ""with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia ... but also in the Black Sea region,"" Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn't have the same security guarantees as NATO members. But Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership. High-stakes talks between What does the United States say? President Joe Biden told Zelensky But Biden appeared to While Biden vowed harsh economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the border, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. ""There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,"" he said. His remarks prompted a swift White House clarification. ""President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,"" press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement. One Ukrainian official told CNN he was ""shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion"" and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions. ""This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,"" the official added. The diplomatic kerfuffle came as Blinken prepared for further talks with European allies on the Ukraine-Russia crisis and to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Blinken has previously warned Russia that ""any Two defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions. US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance. The US The Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. US officials say they are determined not to be caught out by another Russian military operation. ""Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Blinken said late last year. What other factors are at play? Unrest in the former Soviet state of Deadly protests in early January saw the Kazakh government resign, a state of emergency be declared and troops from a Russia-led military alliance deployed to help contain the unrest. But experts have warned that Russia's intervention is Another issue revolves around energy supply. Ukraine views the Nord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against an invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe. Analysts and US lawmakers have raised concerns that Nord Stream 2 will increase European dependence on Russian gas and could allow Moscow to selectively target countries such as Ukraine with energy cut-offs, without broader disruption to European supplies. Bypassing eastern European countries also means those nations would be deprived of lucrative transit fees Russia would otherwise pay. In May 2021, the Biden administration waived sanctions on the company behind Nord Stream 2, effectively giving it the green light. US officials say the move was in the interest of US national security as it sought to rebuild frayed relations with Germany. In November, the US imposed new sanctions on a Russian-linked entity and a vessel linked to Nord Stream 2. Some US senators have called for further sanctions to be imposed to prevent Russia using the pipeline as a weapon; Ukraine too has called for tougher measures.",Tensions are high on Ukraine's border with Russia.

Evergrande is massive -- it has about 200,000 employees, raked in more than $110 billion in sales last year, and owns more than 1,300 developments in more than 280 cities, according to Analysts have long been concerned that a collapse could trigger wider risks for China's property market, hurting homeowners and the broader financial system. Real estate and related industries account for as much as 30% of GDP. Chinese authorities have so far downplayed the prospect of spillover risks. ""China's leadership is attempting to play it cool, but the circumstances surrounding Evergrande's downward spiral raises serious questions about [Chinese President] Xi Jinping's stewardship over China's rapidly cooling economy,"" said Craig Singleton, an adjunct fellow in the China Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a research institute based in Washington, D.C. There's already plenty of evidence that Beijing is taking a leading role in guiding Evergrande through a restructuring of its debt and sprawling business operations. The local government in Guangdong province, where Evergrande is based, said late last week that it would send officials into the firm to oversee risk management, strengthen internal controls and maintain normal operations. And earlier this week, Evergrande announced it would set up a risk management committee, Chinese authorities have taken other steps as well. The central bank on Monday announced that it would pump $188 billion into the economy, apparently to counter the real estate slump. ""These latest interventions, by both the central government and officials in Guangdong, suggest Chinese officials now begrudgingly accept that Evergrande is, in fact, 'too big to fail,'"" Singleton said. Global investors may 'take a hair cut' The massive restructuring is going to come with some pain, at least for global bond holders. Beijing has made it clear that its priority is protecting the thousands of Chinese people who have bought unfinished apartments, along with construction workers, suppliers and small investors. It also wants to limit the risk of other real estate firms going under. Investor fears over Evergrande's default have At the same time, the government has been trying for more than a year to rein in excessive borrowing by developers -- That means the government may be ""happy to see the firm itself go under and investors take a haircut,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a research note on Friday. Chinese regulators have blamed Evergrande's crisis on the company's leaders. Yi's comments on Thursday, made during a video speech to a forum in Hong Kong, underscore the government's priorities.

Fitch said the downgrade reflects the company's inability to pay interest due earlier this week on two dollar-denominated bonds. The payments were due a month ago, and grace periods lapsed Monday. Fitch noted that Evergrande made no announcement about the payments, nor did it respond to inquiries from the ratings agency. ""We are therefore assuming they were not paid,"" Fitch said. Evergrande has about $300 billion in total liabilities, and analysts have worried for months about whether a default could trigger a wider crisis in China's property market, hurting homeowners and the broader financial system. The Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request from CNN Business for comment. However, the company had warned this may be coming. In a stock exchange filing last Friday, it said it might not have enough funds to meet its financial obligations. At that time, it said it was planning to ""actively engage"" with offshore creditors on a restructuring plan. In another filing Monday, the company said it would set up a risk management committee that would be headed by Fears of default sent shares of Evergrande plummeting 20% on Monday. So far this year, the stock has lost 87%. The company had been scrambling for months to raise cash to repay lenders, and Xu has even been selling off personal assets to prop up its finances. It previously appeared to avoid default on any of its offshore bonds by paying overdue interest before their grace periods expired. Now, though, that streak has ended. Another credit ratings agency, S&P, said earlier this week that ""default looks inevitable for Evergrande"" with repayments of $3.5 billion on US-dollar denominated bonds due in the coming months.

Last Friday, the local government in Guangdong province, where Evergrande is based, said it would send a working group to Evergrande to oversee risk management, strengthen internal controls and maintain normal operations, at the request of the company. The People's Bank of China and other top financial regulators have tried to reassure the public that Evergrande's problems can be contained.

So far, Evergrande has failed to publicly address two interest payments on bonds over the past week. That's fueling speculation over Here's what you need to know about Evergrande, and how it got to where it is now. What is Evergrande? Evergrande is one of China's largest real estate developers. The company is part of the Listed in The group was founded by Chinese billionaire Xu Jiayin, also known as Hui Ka Yan in Cantonese, who was Evergrande made its name in residential property -- it Outside housing, the group has invested in In 2010, the company Guangzhou Evergrande continues to reach for new records: It's currently working on creating the Evergrande also caters to tourists through its theme park division, Evergrande Fairyland. Its claim to fame is a massive undertaking called The project includes an artificial island with malls, museums and amusement parks. According to the group's most recent How did it run into trouble? In recent years, Evergrande's debts ballooned as it borrowed to finance its various pursuits. The group has gained infamy for becoming China's most indebted developer, with more than $300 billion worth of liabilities. Over the last few weeks, it's warned investors of cash flow issues, saying that it could default if it's unable to raise money quickly. That warning was In some ways, the company's aggressive ambitions are what landed it in hot water, according to experts. The group ""strayed far from its core business, which is part of how it got into this mess,"" said Mattie Bekink, China director of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Goldman Sachs analysts say the company's structure has also made it ""difficult to ascertain a more precise picture of [its] recovery."" In a But the group's struggles are also emblematic of underlying risks in China. ""The story of Evergrande is the story of the deep [and] structural challenges to China's economy related to debt,"" said Bekink. The issue isn't entirely new. Last year, a slew of Chinese state-owned companies And in 2018, billionaire Wang Jianlin was forced to In a recent note, ""The root of Evergrande's troubles -- and those of other highly-leveraged developers -- is that residential property demand in China is entering an era of sustained decline,"" he wrote. ""Evergrande's ongoing collapse has focused attention on the impact a wave of property developer defaults would have on China's growth."" How is it trying to move forward? The company somewhat placated investors last week after The amount of interest it owed on the bond is about 232 million yuan ($36 million), according to data from Refinitiv. But many questions still remain unanswered. Evergrande did not elaborate on the terms of the payment, and interest worth $83.5 million on a dollar-denominated bond also fell due last Thursday. That deadline came and went without an update from the company. The firm also But instead of going toward its outstanding bond interest payments, the money will likely be used to settle its debts with that lender, Shengjing Bank. The conglomerate said it would still hang on to a 14.75% stake after the deal closes. Evergrande faced another bond interest payment of nearly $50 million Wednesday, though as of noon local time on Thursday it had stayed silent on the status of that debt. On September 14, Evergrande announced that it had brought on financial advisers to help assess the situation. While those firms are tasked with exploring ""all feasible solutions"" as quickly as possible, Evergrande has cautioned that nothing is guaranteed. So far, the conglomerate has struggled to stem the bleeding, and has failed to find buyers for parts of its electric vehicle and property services businesses. As of that filing, it had made ""no material progress"" in its search for investors, and ""it is uncertain as to whether the group will be able to consummate any such sale,"" it said. The electric car company has addressed how those challenges have trickled down, with a On top of that, the group has been trying to sell off its office tower in Hong Kong, which it bought for about $1.6 billion in 2015. But that has ""not been completed within the expected timetable,"" it said in mid-September. How are investors reacting? Evergrande's problems spilled onto the streets this month But shareholders have been wary for months: The stock has shed nearly 85% of its value this year. Earlier this month, Fitch and Moody's Investors Services both downgraded Evergrande's credit ratings, citing its liquidity issues. ""We view a default of some kind as probable,"" Fitch wrote in a Fitch doubled down on that view with a further downgrade on Tuesday, saying that the group was ""likely to have missed [an] interest payment on its senior unsecured notes."" The situation also appears to be spooking investors in China more broadly, at a time when they're already reeling from Beijing's ""In our opinion, how Evergrande credit stresses will be resolved will drive market sentiment,"" Goldman Sachs analysts What could happen next? The Chinese government appears to be starting to intervene. Over the past few days, the People's Bank of China has injected some cash into the financial system, to help settle nerves. On Tuesday alone, it added 100 billion yuan (approximately $15.5 billion), saying it was to keep liquidity going. In a statement this week, the central bank also vowed to ""maintain the healthy development of the real estate market, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of housing consumers."" It doubled down on that message Wednesday in a meeting jointly held with regulators, where authorities emphasized the need to not use ""real estate as a short-term [tool for] economic stimulus,"" according to a central bank Officials also directed the financial sector to focus on stabilizing land and housing prices, adding that institutions should work with ""local governments to jointly maintain the steady and healthy development of the real estate market."" Authorities are clearly watching closely, while attempting to project calm. This month, Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for China's National Bureau of Statistics, acknowledged the difficulties of ""some large real estate companies,"" according to state media. Without naming Evergrande directly, Fu said that China's real estate market had remained stable this year but the impact of recent events ""on the development of the whole industry needs to be observed."" Earlier this month, According to the report, officials in Evergrande's home province of Guangdong have already rejected a bailout request from its founder. Guangdong authorities and Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment. Beijing has few good choices. It will want to protect the thousands of people who have bought unfinished apartments, as well as construction workers, suppliers and small investors. In China, real estate, and its related industries, account for as much as 20% of the urban workforce, according to Christina Zhu, an economist at Moody's Analytics. Authorities will also likely aim to limit the risk of other real estate firms going under. But at the same time, they have long been trying to rein in excessive borrowing by developers -- and won't want to dilute that message. Even with cash infusions, some suggest it may already be too late to save the company. Evergrande's financial problems have been widely dubbed by Chinese media as ""a huge black hole,"" implying that no amount of money can resolve the issue. ""China has really been trying to clean up its bad corporate debt for years. And although they made some progress before the pandemic, the task often seems interminable, and that's what you're certainly seeing here,"" said Bekink.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/john-roberts-abortion-texas/index.html,"CNN The Supreme Court's Chief Justice John Roberts dissented with three liberal justices in what could be regarded as the least considered but most consequential case in years. Since Justice The court's order, Nominated in 2005 by former President George W. Bush, Roberts has warned over the years about the importance of public confidence in the court and has tried to keep the bench from moving too quickly against abortion. Roberts has continued to express a version of the mantra he offered during his confirmation hearings 16 years ago: that the justices should avoid a ""jolt"" to American's legal system. Wednesday night's order, issued with barely three days of consideration, represented nothing short of a jolt and an assault on a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy in its early months. The order leaves in place an abortion ban that is patently unconstitutional under past rulings and that was written to elude judicial review. Texas ""essentially delegated enforcement ... to the populace at large,"" Roberts wrote in his dissent, because it lets private citizens bring cases against anyone who assists a pregnant woman seeking an abortion. Until recently, the chief justice has generally kept a tight rein on the court's direction. The Texas controversy might portend a new dominance by the justices on the far right. Anticipation for the direction of the reconstituted Roberts Court, including on reproductive rights, was already building before the Texas conflict emerged on the national scene. Justices on the far right had been pushing for a reconsideration of abortion-rights rulings, and earlier this year the court announced it would soon review a Mississippi abortion ban tied to 15 weeks of pregnancy. That case is likely to be heard in oral arguments late this year and resolved by June 2022. Roberts' views and his ability to produce any kind of consensus ruling will be tested in that case, as well as in other 2021-22 session cases on subject that traditionally split the court, such as gun control and public funding of religious schools. No longer the 5th vote on abortion In the Texas dispute, the court's three liberals - Justices Roberts, on the other hand, was long positioned on the opposite side of reproductive-rights battles. He began his Washington legal career in the Reagan administration and helped promote the anti-abortion, right-wing social agenda. Last year, when the justices heard a Louisiana abortion dispute, Roberts for the first time voted to strike down an abortion regulation. He provided the crucial fifth vote, then with four liberals (including The Louisiana law was similar to a measure the Supreme Court struck down in Texas four years earlier. Roberts dissented in that 2016 case but felt bound by the court's precedent in the 2020 controversy. This week, Roberts no longer held the pivotal fifth vote. The new conservative majority consists of Barrett and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh (Trump's first two appointees) and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. And Roberts failed to prevail on one of the nation's most wrenching controversies. Abortion rights provoke a mix of religious, cultural and economic interests, the fervor of those who believe life begins at conception and the passion of advocates for women's personal autonomy and choice. Abortion is perennially Topic A in presidential campaigns and congressional races, and it has long been a flashpoint of confirmation battles for judicial nominees. In this week's Texas case, Roberts argued that it was best to block the law and preserve the status quo, while courts weighed whether the Texas legislature acted properly in shielding public officials from responsibility for the law, essentially leaving it in the hands of private citizens. He said the difficult arguments deserved full briefing and oral arguments. But the smart, tactical, usually winning chief justice failed to persuade even one member the far right to join him in those arguments. The conservative majority said the health clinics challenging the law had failed to sufficiently show they would be harmed by the new law taking effect. ""In reaching this conclusion,"" the majority wrote, ""we stress that we do not purport to resolve definitely any jurisdictional or substantive claim in the applicants' lawsuit. In particular, this order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas's law.""",John Roberts has lost control of the Supreme Court

The plan should allow Illinois-based CF Industries CF Industries decided last week to halt operations at its UK fertilizer plants because soaring natural gas prices had made them unprofitable. That announcement sparked warnings of a food supply crisis because its plants also produce about 60% of Britain's food-grade carbon dioxide. The gas is used to stun animals for slaughter, as well as in packaging to extend the shelf life of fresh, chilled and baked goods, and in the production of carbonated drinks. The British Meat Processors Association warned Friday that the supply shock could cause food shortages within 14 days once current stocks of CO2 gas run out. The UK government said Tuesday that it will provide ""limited financial support"" for CF Fertilisers' operating costs for three weeks, after which food producers will have to pay more for CO2 to reflect higher global natural gas prices. UK natural gas futures have increased nearly fourfold since April, according to data from the Intercontinental Exchange. Prices for gas are also rising sharply elsewhere in Europe, due to depleted stocks, competition with Asia for liquified natural gas and low supplies from Russia. Food supply 'fragility' The arrangement with CF Industries will cost UK taxpayers ""many millions of pounds,"" according to environment secretary George Eustice. Without government intervention there would have been a risk to Britain's food supply chain, Eustice told the BBC on Wednesday. He said he believed that the increased cost of CO2 was unlikely to lead to higher food prices, which are already rising due to higher global commodity price inflation and pressure on wages linked to worker shortages. The National Pig Association (NPA) said last week that its members were facing their biggest crisis in two decades as a result of labor shortages tied to Brexit and the pandemic. A dearth of truck drivers and slaughterhouse staff meant that pig farms were running out of space to house their herds and were two weeks away from having to cull animals, the association's chief executive Zoe Davies told ITV News on Monday. ""Many EU workers have gone home due to a combination of new Brexit restrictions and Covid and are unlikely to return,"" the NPA said in a statement last week. Meat processing plants say that efforts to recruit labor domestically have been insufficient to fill ""thousands of vacancies across their sites,"" according to the NPA. The looming CO2 shortage ""highlighted starkly the fragility in the [food] supply chain,"" National Farmers' Union president Minette Batters said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Users of carbon dioxide were given little to no warning that supplies were going to be cut off -- an indication of market failure in a sector supporting our critical national infrastructure,"" she added.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/22/business/europe-energy-gas-renewables-climate-cmd-intl/index.html,"CNN Business European natural Politicians are blaming the surge in But really, Europe's crisis is in its renewables sector. The region has invested heavily in renewables, such as wind and solar, but it can't get enough of this green power to the people who need it. After the There are other incentives to moving faster on renewables, however. A fuller transition would free Europe from the disruption of volatile energy markets and reduce its dependence on other oil and gas providers, such as Russia. Europe could avoid its energy security getting tangled up in geopolitical storms. More than 40 European Union lawmakers, mostly from eastern and Baltic states, Gazprom told CNN Business that it was supplying gas to customers abroad ""in full compliance with existing contractual obligations"" and that supplies were ""at a level close to the historically record high"" over the past eight months. The International Energy Agency said Wednesday that Russian exports to Europe were down from 2019 levels and that the country could do more to increase supplies ahead of winter. ""In terms of the Russian state, there is clear evidence that it uses its gas exports for its own geopolitical gain, it uses that strategically, it's not just a commercial venture,"" said Manchester University's Matthew Paterson, a professor of international politics who researches climate politics. ""It's used gas to get leverage over Ukraine very, very aggressively, and it seems to use it in relation to other eastern central European states,"" he added. Europe has long been a world leader in renewables. Last year, the European Union and United Kingdom used more renewable energy than fossil fuels to generate electricity. But at the same time, the United Kingdom relies on gas for around 40% of its electricity and Europe is expanding and investing heavily in gas. The European Union currently has EUR87 billion ($102 billion) worth of gas projects in the pipeline, according to The bloc is looking to increase gas imports by 35%, which GEM says sits ""at odds with the EU's stated goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050."" Gas has been widely regarded as a ""cleaner"" bridging fuel to use during the transition from coal to renewables for electricity. But there are some problems with that. While gas emits less carbon than coal and oil, it is made mostly of methane, a very harmful greenhouse gas that leaks from pipelines and abandoned wells. Smart grids are part of the answer The gas shortages are being felt more sharply in the United Kingdom, where prices have more than quadrupled and some small energy companies are going bust. Experts say the current energy crisis -- exacerbated by a lack of wind in the North Sea this summer --  underscores the need for Europe to build more renewable infrastructure in more places, and to diversify its sources. ""Part of the answer is to put more windmills up in different places, because the wind will be blowing somewhere,"" Paterson said. The United Kingdom could explore more around hydropower and solar energy. ""People make the quip about the UK being gray, but you don't need to know too much about solar cells to know that's irrelevant. You will get more if it is sunny, but even in Manchester, you'd get plenty of electricity and there's opportunity for that."" Another part of the answer is focusing on the demand side, not just supply, said Lisa Fischer, who leads the climate think tank E3G's program on the decarbonization of energy systems. ""Europe has been building renewables quickly, and while we could go faster, what has been slow is critical action in cutting energy demand and making it more flexible,"" she told CNN Business. In England and Wales, data shows that homes that aren't newly built are Smart grids are another big part of the solution, Fischer said. Smart grids are digital electricity networks that can intelligently assess the behavior of its consumers, then respond with the right amount and type of energy required. While Europe has strong mandates for smart grid developments, the bloc and the United Kingdom lag behind countries like the United States and China, which are leading investment in this technology, Rooftop solar panels are another option. The UK government has flip-flopped several times on subsidies and regulations around rooftop panels for new homes. Better support in that area would allow residents to store energy themselves and sell unused power back to the national electricity grid, Fischer said. ""If we don't harness that, then we will need fossil fuels as a backup. If we do, it's definitely possible to operate energy systems without a fossil fuel backup,"" Fischer added. China the new energy world's winner While a full transition to renewables and low-emissions energy will mean more security independence for countries, the technology to harness the energy will create clear winners and losers in an energy-driven world order.  Exporting and even building this infrastructure will give China's standing in the world a boost and increase its influence. ""What China has been doing and will likely continue to do, is to export the equipment that is used to produce renewable energy,"" said Dominic Chiu, a China analyst with the Albright Stonebridge Group. ""China has also been helping countries, such as Pakistan, build solar farms. Energy infrastructure, renewable or otherwise, plays an important role in China's Belt and Road initiative,"" Chiu added. That dynamic means that there is still lots of potential for energy security to get tied up in geopolitical tensions, or other thornier topics. An investigation published in May by the UK's On a ""That is a potential concern that many countries have with China's polysilicon production,"" Chiu said, referring to the material used in the panels. But sanctions haven't had a huge impact on the industry, Chiu said. Beyond the obvious climate benefits, there is an undeniable political advantage of renewables over fossil fuels such as gas. A country like Russia can cut off supplies for Europe with a flick of a switch, but once a solar panel or windmill is installed, that's that -- no country can take the sun or wind away from another.","Europe's gas crisis is also a renewables crisis, but there are ready solutions"

But with the United States making clear it views countries that don't condemn Putin's war as aligned with Russia, the world's two most populous nations are facing increased international pressure to speak out - or risk being seen as complicit. That neither country has chosen to do so has illuminated Russia's outsized influence in Asia, where arms sales and no-strings-attached trade have allowed Moscow to exploit regional fault lines and weaker ties to the West. In the US and Europe, leaders have framed their response to the invasion as part of a broader ideological battle to uphold democratic freedoms and the rule of law. But for two of Asia's major powers, those lines are more blurred, with experts suggesting India and China are motivated more by their own self interests. China and Russia As Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine just weeks before Russia invaded, Xi and Putin had never seemed closer. In a The countries racked up a record-breaking The two share a 4,000-kilometer (2,458-mile) border, and But the real key behind their tightening ties are their mutual tensions with Washington. Now their so-called limitless relationship is being tested. Already, questions have been raised over how much Xi knew about Putin's plans. A Western intelligence report indicated So far, China has But Beijing also has links to Ukraine, which In a call with his Ukrainian counterpart last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was ""deeply grieved"" by the conflict. And while there's a chance China could benefit economically from a more reliant and isolated Russia, Beijing will also be China will also have to contend with potential fallout in its relationships with the West. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has united Western allies like no other issue in recent years and China's tacit support has not gone unnoticed. Some analysts have pointed to parallels between Russia's designs on Ukraine and fears over the future of Taiwan - a self-governing island democracy that China's Communist Party claims as its own and has not ruled out taking by force. ""Ukraine is a wake-up call for Europe and North America and the other democracies,"" said Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute at the University of London. ""You will suddenly have countries in Europe and elsewhere realizing that they have to prepare for eventualities that since the end of the Cold War, over 30 years, we have not thought necessary."" ""In that context, the assertiveness of China and the Chinese declared ambitions over Taiwan will get a lot more countries more worried,"" he said. India and Russia There's an elephant in the room when it comes to India's relationship with Russia: China. India, the world's biggest democracy, has looked to counter China's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. One sign of that is India's role in the Quad - an informal security grouping with the United States, Japan and Australia that's recently become more active. And it has a defense relationship with Russia - estimates range upwards of 50% for how much of India's military equipment came from Russia. That equipment is vital given India's ongoing tensions at the border with China, which could escalate again. India also has a fraught relationship with its neighbor Pakistan, which Meanwhile, India inked a India isn't looking at the situation in Ukraine in terms of their relationship with that country - it's thinking about the dangers in its own backyard, Happymon Jacob, an associate professor of diplomacy and disarmament at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said. ""This isn't about going against the West or supporting Russia,"" Jacob said. ""(India's government) hasn't explicitly supported Russia, but they have to take a more careful, nuanced approach."" So far, India has tried to play both sides - Modi has spoken with both Zelensky and Putin, and has pledged humanitarian aid for Ukraine. Modi hasn't explicitly Russia and India have a long history of friendly relations, ""India needs Russia to stand up to China,"" said Harsh V. Pant, a professor in international relations at King's College London and head of the Strategic Studies Program at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. ""It will have to balance its historic ties with Russia with its burgeoning ties with the West."" The US' defense trade with India has risen from And there's domestic pressure too - after an Indian student was killed during Russia's shelling of Kharkiv last week while buying groceries, there's been growing calls within India to help evacuate the hundreds of other Indian students stuck in the northeastern city of Sumy, which has come under heavy bombardment in recent days. Self interest Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, this tangle of relationships was sometimes fraught. Now with widespread condemnation against its actions, Russia is likely to be considered a pariah state in the West. And that could make its relationships with countries like China and India even more important. ""In (Putin's) first stint as President, he put a lot of emphasis in rekindling old Soviet ties with Asian partners,"" said Herve Lemahieu, director of research at the Australia-based think tank the Lowy Institute. ""He does have ballast in Asia ... and, as we've seen, he has more than just China to rely on."" Both China and India are maintaining the friendship out of self-interest - but for very different reasons. China has a ""clear interest"" in making sure people like Putin stay in power, says SOAS's Tsang. ""They share two primary strategic interests: one is to take the American global leadership down a notch or two. The second is to make the world safe for authoritarianism,"" Tsang said. But Beijing's support is conditional - if the Russians are unsuccessful to the point that they can't aid the countries' shared aims, China could recalibrate its support, he said.

In recent days, senior Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and influential Communist Party publications have accused the US of seeking to build a NATO-like bloc in the Indo-Pacific, with one official warning of ""unimaginable"" consequences if it does. At a conference in Beijing on Saturday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said the Ukraine crisis could be used as a ""mirror"" to view the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region. Le didn't name the US, but Building ""closed and exclusive small circles or groups"" in the region ""is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe,"" Le said at the event at Tsinghua University, according to a version of the speech published by China's Foreign Ministry. ""If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences, and ultimately push the Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss,"" he said. China's criticism of NATO follows attempts to portray itself as a neutral actor in the Ukraine crisis, However, China's bid to draw parallels between the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific and NATO's ""eastward expansion"" in Europe closely echoes talking points from Moscow, raising serious doubts as to Beijing's supposed neutrality. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has repeatedly attempted to use China 'takes advantage' of crisis Washington's emphasis on the Indo-Pacific has come as China pushes a more aggressive foreign policy, doubling down on its territorial claims, while taking a harder line in response to perceived challenges.

There, Ambassador Deng Xijun accused the US of ""creating a set of 'gang rules' while claiming to uphold the international order"" and taking the region ""down an evil path,"" according to Chinese state-run media The Paper. A similar tone was adopted in an opinion piece in China's People's Liberation Army Daily, republished last weekend on the website of the influential Communist Party journal Qiushi, which took aim at the Indo-Pacific strategy and said the US creation of blocs was an ""important reason for the continuing souring and escalation of the Ukraine issue."" This is not the first time that China has sought to draw parallels between the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific and NATO in recent years, and the concerns get at the heart of a key stance that has drawn Russia and China closer together: their mutual distrust of the US. That was underlined in But experts point out there are vast differences between NATO, a security alliance, and the US strategy in Indo-Pacific, which is not just about security, but includes a range of policies. The US, with its own long Pacific Ocean border and island state of Hawaii, also has territories in the Indo-Pacific, including Guam. Other nations have also increased activities in the region in an effort to counter China's influence. In the past year, Britain sent its The Chinese stance, meanwhile, ignores the fact US security partnerships have come in response to China's own rapid military modernization, according to Drew Thompson, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. The US is ""increasingly drawn into deeper and stronger security alliances because of (China's military) modernization"" and Beijing's ""lack of openness and transparency"" toward its neighbors about its intentions, Thompson said. But China's leaders ""don't see a connection between other countries in the region hedging against China's military modernization"" through relationships with the US, he added. The question of Taiwan Another issue much closer to home may also explain why China is keen to call up its concerns over the US in the Asia-Pacific region amid the Ukraine crisis - Taiwan. This ""Some people in the US have sent a wrong signal to 'Taiwan independence' forces. This is very dangerous. Mishandling of the Taiwan question will have a disruptive impact on the bilateral ties,"" Xi told Biden, according to a Foreign Ministry readout.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/biden-abortion/index.html,"CNN A The absence of the word in Biden's public remarks and statements has frustrated activists, who say it reflects an issue that fell off the priority list even as women's right to an abortion comes under threat  In a statement Thursday morning, Biden used the word again, harshly criticizing the Texas law as an ""unprecedented assault on a woman's constitutional rights."" In far stronger language than he'd employed a day earlier, Biden called the law's novel enforcement structure - which allows private citizens to bring civil suits against anyone who assists a pregnant person seeking an abortion - a ""bizarre scheme"" with the potential to unleash ""unconstitutional chaos."" ""Complete strangers will now be empowered to inject themselves in the most private and personal health decisions faced by women,"" he wrote. Biden said he was launching a ""whole of government"" effort to respond to the law, tasking the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department ""to see what steps the Federal Government can take to ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions."" He said the effort would be led from within the White House. As the Texas law that prohibits abortions after six weeks takes effect, Biden is facing pressure to defend abortion rights more aggressively. It's an issue the President has shifted on over the course of his long career, including as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, when he reversed his stance on a measure allowing federal funds to pay for abortion. In his two statements on the Texas law, Biden has vowed to find a way to protect a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. Yet the avenues for doing so remain unclear, and so far the White House has been vague on what specific actions might be possible. Asked Wednesday by reporters what options Biden had available to him, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the President would push Congress to codify Roe v. Wade as law. ""That is a specific course of action that can be taken to help protect from these type of lawsuits in the future,"" she said. The prospect of Congress enshrining a right to abortion in law remains a long shot; doing so would require 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a certain Republican filibuster, and even passage in the House is unclear given Democrats' narrowest of majorities. Biden had already faced calls to support changes to filibuster rules for issues like voting rights but has stopped short of supporting getting rid of the filibuster altogether. In 2018, Democrats successfully used the filibuster to prevent a law banning abortion after 20 weeks when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House - a reminder of how changes to the rules could haunt them down the road if the GOP returns to the majority. Since taking office, Biden has taken some steps to reverse restrictive abortion rules from the Trump era, including the ""Mexico City Policy"" banning US funding of international organizations that perform abortions. He also tasked the Department of Health and Human Services to replace a Trump-era rule barring certain federally funded health care providers from referring patients for abortions, a step long demanded by abortion rights groups. Yet the issue has been far from a driving agenda item for his administration. As a senator, Biden had been among the more moderate Democrats on abortion, including supporting the Hyde Amendment that banned federal abortion funding. In 2019, as he was vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden said he'd changed his mind, even as he declared he made ""no apologies for my last position."" Instead, he said he'd reversed his position because largely Republican-led states had enacted strict new abortion laws. Biden, a Catholic, has also faced criticism from conservative US bishops, who earlier this year sought to enact rules that would deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights. Biden has shrugged off those attempts, calling it a ""private matter"" that he did not think would gain traction. For Biden and his party, the political environment has been deteriorating for weeks. The resurgence of coronavirus infections, rising fears of inflation, and catastrophic images from Afghanistan have pulled down the President's public standing and brightened Republican prospects for regaining control of Congress in the 2022 midterm elections. The restrictive Texas abortion law, and the Supreme Court's willingness to let it take effect, could alter the political equation in Democrats' favor, some operatives said. ""Democrats will use this to gin up their disillusioned base,"" said Republican pollster Glen Bolger. ""It's a policy disaster but a political bonanza,"" observed Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who advises party leaders in Congress. ""Democrats will finally realize the right to choose is not a settled issue but rather, actually at stake in these elections. They will be fired up, and ready to vote, and anxious to give of their time and money."" As the issue returns to the fore with Texas's new law, Biden is facing renewed calls to endorse an expansion of the Supreme Court after it allowed Texas's restrictive new abortion law to take effect. Biden as a candidate punted on the question, and instead established a commission of experts to weigh that and other ideas for reforming the Supreme Court. The panel has met three times since it was established in April - once each in May, June and July. The meetings have occurred virtually, and mostly entail the members and witnesses reading from prepared testimony. They are all available on the White House website. More meetings are scheduled in the fall, and a report is due by November 15, which is 180 days since the panel's first public meeting. Officials say the report will not contain recommendations for or against expanding the court or other potential changes. Instead, it will analyze various arguments for and against Supreme Court reform. Officials say it could inform further debate among lawmakers. Aside from court expansion, the panel has heard arguments over limiting the court's power of judicial review; changing how the court decides which cases to hear; and debated the idea of term limits for justices. The panel has also engaged on the so-called ""shadow docket,"" which allows the court to make decisions without full public arguments or briefings - a practice that has come under new scrutiny following the use of the tactic in the Texas case. In his statement Thursday, Biden also criticized the court for deciding in secret something with major ramifications. ""For the majority to do this without a hearing, without the benefit of an opinion from a court below, and without due consideration of the issues, insults the rule of law and the rights of all Americans to seek redress from our courts,"" Biden wrote. ""Rather than use its supreme authority to ensure justice could be fairly sought, the highest Court of our land will allow millions of women in Texas in need of critical reproductive care to suffer while courts sift through procedural complexities."" The Supreme Court commission, led by former White House counsel Bob Bauer, was established in April and is comprised of 36 members across an ideological spectrum. Most are professors at elite law schools.",Biden launches federal effort to respond to Texas law as he faces pressure to protect abortion

The US bought about $25 billion in goods from Russia last year, not including $4.8 billion in crude oil. That may sound like a lot, but the non-oil purchases amount to only slightly more than half of what US customers bought from tiny Thailand last year. Commodities such as wheat and lumber are major Russian exports, and those prices have increased on global commodity markets as well. Russia also is a major exporter of such crucial metals as aluminum, palladium, nickel and titanium. Palladium is used in automobiles, mobile phones and even dental fillings. Nickel is used to make steel and electric car batteries. Titanium is crucial to aerospace products, including commercial jets. Uncertainty about the supply of those products, and the rise in prices on commodity markets, could create ""further disruption to global supply chains already suffering from the pandemic and shortages of semiconductors,"" said a note Monday from Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macroeconomics for ING Research. That could also feed higher prices as the shortage of computer chips is a major factor in new and used car prices hitting record levels. ""Globally, a surge in commodity prices will aggravate already existing inflationary pressures,"" Brzeski said.

Since December, the ancient city known as the home of the Terracotta Warriors has been To date, more than 1,600 cases have been reported in the city. While the number pales in comparison to those in many other countries, the outbreak pushed China's caseload in the final week of 2021 to the highest level since March 2020. For 12 days and counting, Xi'an's 13 million residents have been confined to their homes. The city, formerly a tourist hotspot, welcomed the new year with deserted streets, shuttered stores, sealed-off residential compounds and an empty airport. The But it is also among the most chaotic, leaving residents short of food and other essential supplies and affecting access to medical services. A groundswell of anger and frustration at the local government has ensued, underscoring the growing challenge facing China's zero-Covid policy, which relies on a playbook of mass testing, extensive quarantines and snap lockdowns to stamp out any resurgence of the virus. For almost two years, these stringent measures have shielded the majority of the country from the worst aspects of the pandemic, winning overwhelming public support. But as local outbreaks continue to flare up, the outcry in Xi'an raises the question of just how long zero-Covid can be sustained before public support begins to taper off, with millions of residents trapped in an seemingly endless cycle of lockdowns. Over the past week, Chinese social media was inundated with cries for help and criticism over perceived incompetence of the local Xi'an government. Residents flooded a livestream of a government Covid news conference with demands for groceries - prompting embarrassed officials to disable all comments. Despite some censorship, the issue has continued to gain traction. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, the hashtag ""Grocery shopping in Xi'an is difficult"" has been viewed 380 million times as of Monday. Many expressed In the first few days of the lockdown, each household was allowed to send one designated person out to buy groceries every two days. But as cases continued to rise, Xi'an further tightened lockdown measures, requiring all residents to stay at home unless permitted to go outside for mass testing. ""Previously I thought those panic buying folks were stupid. Now I've realized I am the stupid one,"" said a comment on Weibo. Faced with the public outcry, local officials pledged steady deliveries of groceries to residents, with state media carrying footage of food arriving at residential compounds. While the supply shortage was eased in some neighborhoods, other residents complained on social media - including in Meanwhile, the heavy-handed approach adopted in some areas to enforce the lockdown has fueled further outrage. On Friday, footage emerged on Weibo of a man being beaten by Covid prevention workers at the gates of a residential compound when he tried to enter with a bag of steamed buns. The video, which immediately went viral, showed the buns scattered on the ground as the man tumbled. The ensuing outcry prompted a For some, the cost of the lockdown was just too high. Last week, state media reported on two incidents of individuals going to extreme lengths to escape from Xi'an before restrictions kicked in. A man trekked for 100 kilometers (62 miles) across the Qinling mountain range from the Xi'an airport, avoiding multiple village checkpoints on the way before he was finally spotted and taken into quarantine on December 24, eight days into his journey, according to a statement from the Ningshan county police. In the other incident, a man cycled for 10 hours overnight in close to freezing temperatures in an attempt to return to his hometown, after he learned Xi'an would be locked down the next day. He was taken into quarantine and fined 200 yuan, according to a statement from the Chunhua county police.

If the trend continues, it will likely be only a matter of weeks before Xi'an successfully contains its outbreak as other cities have in the past.

Experts say Ben Gvir's ban is unlikely to stand up to legal scrutiny.

These factors are considered in light of public safety and the potential for criminal offenses, such as supporting a terrorist organization.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/us-military-support-ukraine-russia/index.html,"CNN The Biden administration is weighing new options, including providing more arms to The discussions, described by multiple sources familiar with them, reflect a sense of pessimism in the administration following last week's diplomatic talks with Russian officials that yielded no breakthroughs and as In addition to considering how to help the Ukrainian military and government fend off an invasion, the US is evaluating options for bolstering Ukrainian forces' ability to resist a potential Russian occupation. That includes potentially providing the Ukrainian Army with additional ammunition, mortars, Javelin anti-tank missiles, and anti-aircraft missile systems, which would likely come from NATO allies, a senior US official told CNN. The news comes ahead of a President ""We are looking at a range of options to help defend Ukraine,"" a senior administration official told CNN. This may include additional defensive arms sales, ""advice,"" and ""helping Ukraine be able to stay in the fight against a larger, conventional Russian military presence."" The deliberations about supporting a resistance campaign reflect an increasingly pessimistic view inside the administration about Putin's willingness to invade and occupy large swaths of Ukrainian territory. Russia has increased force levels since Friday, the senior administration official said. ""Let's be clear. Our view is this is an extremely dangerous situation. We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday. ""And what Secretary Blinken is going to go do is highlight very clearly there's a diplomatic path forward. It is the choice of President Putin and the Russians to make whether they're going to suffer severe economic consequences or not."" Right now, military sources familiar with the planning say there has been no official change in guidance from Washington, and officials emphasized that these are early considerations that have not yet been formally presented to the President for approval. Some members of the administration are wary of getting bogged down in an anti-occupation support effort and have argued that US forces should leave if a war erupts. Increased pessimism US officials left the meetings in Europe last week even more pessimistic about what Putin could be planning, and how limited the west's leverage is to stop it--even with the punishing sanctions and increased NATO presence in eastern Europe currently on the table. ""We can exact some pain, but there is a big difference between exacting pain and actually having leverage,"" a senior US official said. As recently as late last week, Biden administration officials were conducting table-top exercises gaming out all of the possible US and allied policy responses, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. Top US officials also spent much of the weekend in senior-level meetings to discuss the way forward, a senior State Department official said. The US has continued to say that diplomacy is ""crucial"" and that talks will hopefully continue. But there have been no details on what the next diplomatic steps look like, and Russia has been drawing down its diplomatic presence in Kyiv in what a US official said was ominous and concerning to the US. Russia's foreign ministry denied on Tuesday that it had begun evacuating diplomatic personnel, saying ""The Russian embassy in Kyiv is operating in a standard way."" Pentagon officials, meanwhile, have been drawing up options for how the US could help to fuel a sustained resistance campaign in Ukraine and inflict the highest possible costs on Russia in the wake of any invasion, according to sources familiar with the conversations. The CIA continues to operate an intelligence collection training program in the US for Ukrainian special operators and intelligence officials, current and former officials familiar with the program tell CNN. The program was A CIA spokesman pushed back on any suggestion that the program has helped to train a Ukrainian insurgency in waiting, but former intelligence officials familiar with it say that the program includes the kind of covert paramilitary training needed to collect intelligence in a warzone. ""The purpose of the training, and the training that was delivered, was to assist in the collection of intelligence, not to assist in an insurgency,"" a senior intelligence official said. Putin's plans still unclear US officials still don't know what Putin's plans are, or whether he has even made up his mind to invade. Some officials who have seen the intelligence say there is evidence Russia is planning to try to take Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and overthrow the government. The deployment of forces from Russia's Eastern Military District into Belarus on Monday struck many US officials and Russian military analysts as particularly ominous, as have a spate of cyberattacks targeting Ukraine last week. But others believe it is more likely that Russia will launch a more limited operation in eastern Ukraine aimed at securing a land bridge to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The US on Friday Like within the Biden administration, Ukrainian officials have not concluded that Putin has made up his mind, a Ukrainian official said, adding that the talks in Europe had no perceptible impact on the crisis. Meanwhile, the buildup of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders - and in neighboring Belarus - has continued to grow. ""We see that it's not de-escalating, it's ongoing,"" the official said. ""Still not enough to do a full-scale invasion and sustain it but it's still a lot."" As part of the build-up, Russia has deployed more aircraft closer to the border, which has raised fears of a significant air component to an eventual invasion. Two to three dozen Sukhov-34 fighter jets have joined helicopters positioned near Ukraine, the official said. Ukrainian defense officials are in daily contact with US counterparts at the Pentagon, the official said, preparing for a variety of different actions the Russians could take. ""We prepared a response for each scenario,"" the official said. ""We are going to fight if something happens. Our people are ready to fight. Every window will shoot if [Russians] go [in]."" ""Everyone who is willing to fight will do so and will receive a weapon for this, like in 2014,"" the official continued, adding that individual ""reservists"" who have received some training will simply have to sign up at a recruiting office.

But suggestions that Xu's debt repayment strategy may be getting personal aren't going away.  The government is ""clearly setting the example of excessive risk taking, which is something the Chinese government is very keen on eliminating"" said Peter Cai, a China analyst from the Lowy Institute, an Australia-based think tank. ""By making an example of these billionaires who have taken way too much debt for their companies, I think it's a way to demonstrate the government's resolve."" A dramatic rise, then a sudden fall Evergrande's The company rode the boom of home buyers rushing to urban cities, as hundreds of millions of people across China were lifted out of poverty -- a change that created metropolises from villages. Evergrande alone built more than 1,000 developments in hundreds of cities and claims it creates more than 3.8 million jobs a year. Property supercharged China's economy, and has ballooned to account for as much as 30% of China's GDP. Cheap money also fueled developers to keep building: Evergrande, for example, expanded into bottled water, electric cars -- even pig farming. By 2017, Xu became Asia's richest person, and was famous for his extravagant lifestyle and taste for luxury. During one of China's annual legislative conferences, Xu went viral online for wearing a black suit with a flashy Hermes gold belt, earning himself the moniker ""belt brother."" And according to the book ""Red Roulette"" by Chinese businessman Desmond Shum, Xu once ordered his private jet to fly empty to Paris, while he played cards with a friend in another jet headed for the same place. While Xu was an archetype of China's crazy rich, he also successfully aligned himself with Beijing and the ruling Chinese Communist Party -- at least for a while. He was known as a philanthropist and is a member of China's Political Consultative Committee, which advises the government on policy. ""All I have and all that Evergrande Group has achieved were endowed by the Party, the state and the whole society,"" Xu said in a 2018 speech. But that strategy failed last year, when Beijing started to crack down on unrestrained borrowing in real estate -- an ongoing issue in China, where the housing market has been cooling for some time. In August 2020, the Chinese government unveiled a ""three red lines"" policy to limit debt from developers, which analysts say has contributed to the liquidity crisis now unfolding at Evergrande and other developers. ""There's been a decision at the very top, that this buildup of reckless credit expansion is becoming a danger to China and presumably a threat to the Party rule,"" said Leland Miller, the CEO of China Beige Book.

He argued NATO must agree to Russia's demands, including a vow not to add new members and a retreat of NATO forces to their positions dating back to 1997 - a set of commitments NATO said from the outset it wouldn't consider. It seemed easy to imagine that Putin could turn to the Russian people and say, 'Look, I tried diplomacy, but the West rejected it. We have no choice but to invade Ukraine.'

Perhaps the Russian people believe Putin's Russia's menacing stance toward Ukraine, its Ukraine, of course, poses no serious military threat to The only threat Ukraine poses to Putin - not to Russia - is becoming a functioning democracy at a time when the Russian leader is seeking to cement his place as an unremovable autocrat, and now one By creating The message to Moscow was clear.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/20/economy/china-gdp-real-estate-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business China's growth The country's GDP grew at its slowest pace in a year last quarter, expanding just 4.9% from a year earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, the economy grew a mere 0.2% in the July-to-September period -- one of the weakest quarters since China started releasing such records in 2011. Disruptions due to the global shipping crisis and a massive energy crunch contributed to the slowdown. Shipping delays and mounting inventories in China have hit smaller manufacturers that are now hurting for cash, resulting in lost orders and production cuts. And factory output has been dented in large part because of power shortages, a result of high demand for fossil fuel that has clashed with a national push to reduce carbon emissions. But some of the most significant concerns for growth are now rippling through the real estate sector, which is suffering from the energy woes along with a government drive to curb excessive borrowing. Real estate-related activities -- including cement and steel production -- registered steep contractions last month, as did property sales and new construction projects. That has led to reduced property investment, which contracted in September for the first time since March 2020. On Wednesday, While the power crunch has undoubtedly weighed on the real estate sector, Beijing's crackdown is also taking its toll. Fearing the property market had become overheated, the government last year started requiring developers to cut their debt levels. It has also pledged to tame runaway home prices. Since then, companies like embattled conglomerate Evergrande have been grappling with major debt problems, triggering worries about the risk of contagion for the sector and the broader economy. Beijing seems unlikely to do much to ease its tight curbs on the real estate sector, according to economists at Societe Generale -- ""possibly because they are attributing most of the blame to the power crunch, which has now eased but is not resolved."" ""To our mind, housing is the key and there seems nothing substantial in the near term to mitigate the downtrend,"" wrote the firm's Wei Yao and Michelle Lam in a Monday report. They added that there is a ""very strong consensus among policymakers that housing is at the root of China's many structural problems."" A real estate downturn will almost certainly continue to weigh on economic growth. Research firms and banks have already slashed their forecasts for China's GDP this year and next, worrying that the risks of a severe, property-led slowdown are rising. Oxford Economics, for example, cut its forecast for fourth quarter growth to 3.6% from 5%. The firm recently trimmed its 2022 GDP forecast to 5.4% from 5.8%, mostly due to concerns about the real estate sector, power shortages and Covid-19. ""Stakes are high in managing the property slowdown,"" wrote Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a Wednesday report. He added the ""relatively large economic footprint"" of the real estate sector in China -- it comprises about a quarter or so of GDP -- means even a gradual or ""managed"" slowdown would ""significantly"" affect the economy. A 'key' challenge long-term The housing crackdown is China's ""key long-term challenge,"" according to Aidan Yao, senior emerging Asia economist with AXA Investment Managers. He downgraded his forecast for GDP growth this year to 7.9% from 8.5%, partly because of Beijing's firm stance on controlling debt in the property market and elsewhere. Chinese President Xi Jinping's desire to control the housing market is no secret. In 2017, he famously announced that ""housing is for living and not for speculation."" But Beijing's campaign has gained additional momentum during the coronavirus pandemic, as the government became concerned that too much cheap money was flooding a sector that was already highly leveraged. That worry led authorities to force developers last year to trim their debt levels. This year, Xi has also ramped up promises to close what he sees as a worsening wealth gap, saying ""common prosperity"" would be a top government priority. That pledge has been reflected in tightening rules on all sorts of industries, including tech and other types of private enterprise. But it's also apparent in real estate, as Chinese state media outlets blame soaring housing prices for worsening income inequality. As all of this unfolds, a liquidity crunch has worsened among the real estate sector's weakest corporations. The company's crisis has unsettled global investors in recent weeks, who worry a bankrupt Evergrande could lead to a domino effect. Other property firms, including Fantasia Holdings and Modern Land, have already indicated they are struggling to pay their debts. Chinese authorities have tried to assuage fears about Evergrande. The People's Bank of China said Friday the company had mismanaged its business but risks to the financial system were ""controllable."" Yao, from AXA Investment Managers, said Beijing isn't likely to change its course on regulation. ""Beijing's tolerance for short-term pains from actions that foster longer-term sustainability has been a major surprise to the market anticipating a blow-out growth number for 2021,"" he said. The tech crackdown, after all, has wiped more than $1 trillion off the value of major Chinese stocks worldwide, but isn't slowing down, either. Yao added that while there may be ""further fine-tuning"" of housing market policies, he sees ""no reversal to the overall tightening stance.""",China's real estate crisis could threaten growth into 2022.

Instead, China's Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying - who repeated staid lines about seeking peace through dialogue and said the situation was ""not what we would hope to see"" - was quick to point the finger at the US, implying that Washington was a ""culprit"" for ""fanning up flames,"" referring to ""China has taken a responsible attitude and persuaded all parties not to escalate tensions or incite war...Those who follow the US' lead in fanning up flames and then shifting the blame onto others are truly irresponsible,"" she said.

The presence of Hua at the briefing both days was itself unusual, as the veteran spokeswoman had not been at the podium in such briefings since she was promoted to assistant minister for foreign affairs in October. Her comments were widely disseminated across China's official state media and social media platforms, where talk of Ukraine dominated coverage and conversation. 'War is not funny' But while state media reflected the official government line, top trending topics on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, included a speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin with more than 360 million views, as well as others looking at how Ukrainian citizens were reacting, such as a post on people lining up to donate blood with 62 million views. The topic ""Ukraine President says Western countries completely give up on Ukraine,"" topped the list in the morning, raking up over 1 billion views throughout the day and tens of thousands of comments. Many of those comments on the highly moderated platform mocked Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky for being ""pro-West"" and cheered for Russia and Putin. But others pushed back: ""War is not funny at all,"" wrote one user, whose post was liked over 60,000 times. ""It makes me feel physically sick to see all the jokes about war.""

The post, which was swiftly deleted, also directed employees to ""filter and release proper comments."" Beijing government-controlled Beijing News declined CNN's request for comment on the incident.

It would also contradict China's usual vocal support for state sovereignty and territorial integrity. In a phone conversation between Xi and Putin on Friday, Xi said China ""decides its position based on the merits of the Ukraine issue itself,"" and that China supports Russia and Ukraine resolving their issue through negotiation, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. ""China is willing to work with all parties in the international community to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept,"" Xi reportedly added.

Scientists said the heatwave that supercharged the fires was The climate crisis has been a lingering concern for voters for a long time, though it's Climate change rarely makes or breaks an election. But the tide appears to be turning. Canadians, who go to the polls on Monday, are among several nations casting votes on the heels of record-smashing, often deadly extreme weather this summer, boosted by climate change. In the run-up to Canada's parliamentary vote, the climate crisis has featured heavily in campaign activities, media coverage and debates. It was the same story in Norway, which voted last Monday, and in Germany, which will hold its elections on September 26. Finally, the climate crisis is on the ballot. ""Clearly, climate change was something that a lot of Canadians were experiencing or have experienced in ways that perhaps they hadn't before,"" Shane Gunster, an associate professor in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, told CNN. ""For the first time, you actually have all of the major parties in the Canadian election that have at least a serious climate plan to propose."" Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said that globally, the climate crisis was increasing in importance among voters as an election issue. There are three good reasons why. ""One is just simply that the science itself has gotten ever stronger and more frightening, frankly,"" he said. A state-of-the-science report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published in August as fires raged and floods engulfed communities across the Northern Hemisphere. The report called humans' role in the crisis ""unequivocal,"" and warned that climate change was happening faster than previously thought. Global temperatures are already around 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say the planet should stay below 1.5 degrees to avoid even more frequent extreme weather and relatively unknown climate tipping points. ""Another critical thing that's been happening is that media coverage has both increased in quantity and in quality,"" Leiserowitz said. ""And the third critical piece is, of course, these extreme events - all-time, record-setting and just eye-popping kinds of disasters happening around the world, which is increasingly being attributed to being made more severe by climate change."" What was extraordinary about this summer was that records were being shattered not just by the usual fraction of a degree but by huge margins. Lytton, the Canadian village that was The climate crisis has fueled a surge for Green or climate-centered parties in places like Germany and Norway. In Canada, the Greens are struggling, but the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, has capitalized on the interest. The NDP is polling with 20% of the vote, not that far from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives, which are both at around 30%, according to a Like in Norway, discourse around the climate crisis in Canada invariably centers on oil and gas. Canada is the world's fifth-biggest crude oil producer, and Trudeau is coming under increasing pressure to take an ax to fossil fuel subsidies. He pledged to reduce them when he was first elected, but they have only gone up under his six-year leadership. The same is true for Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, which in 2019 were actually In fire-ravaged British Columbia, it's the NDP that's in the lead, Its leader, Singh, is calling for more ambitious climate plans than the Liberals and Conservatives, including halving emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. The Liberals' current reduction target is 40% to 45% and the Conservatives want to reduce it to 30%. ""What we shouldn't do is what Mr. Trudeau did: Set targets and miss them,"" Singh said at a recent leaders' debate. ""We shouldn't promise to end fossil fuel subsidies and then increase them. We shouldn't put a price on pollution and then exempt the biggest polluters."" German parties seek to better Merkel on climate The NDP isn't likely to win the election, or even become the main opposition, but its strong polling means Singh could become a kingmaker in a potential Trudeau-led coalition. The Liberals are projected to get the most seats, but fall short of a majority. It could choose to rule as a minority government, but even if it did, it would need the NDF as an ally. It's a role that smaller, climate-focused parties are increasingly finding themselves in around the world. In Germany, the Green Party is likely to crown the king. ""Unlike in election years in the past, we've seen climate as a core issue right from the start - given people's insistence on climate action in the polls, all major parties have made it a main element of their rhetoric,"" said Jeremie Gagne, a senior associate at the research group More in Common. It would be near impossible not to in the country following its deadly floods, which scientists described as a one-in-500-year weather event. Parts of Germany experienced more rain in a day than they typically would in a whole month. Gagne said that Germans were feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by trying to reduce emissions in their role as consumers, while political and business figures with power weren't doing their fair share. ""So, there is a widespread demand for politics to take binding action that leads the way and ensures fair contributions by all,"" Gagne said. The German election will mark the end of Chancellor Angela Merkel's 16-year rule. She was regarded as a formidable leader in the country, but also internationally, but she wasn't always strong on climate. Her government, which is projected to lose the election, had planned to continue using coal until 2038. It has also stayed loyal to the idea of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, as her critics argued now was not the time to be investing in more fossil fuels. But now, all parties, with the exception of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, are putting forward robust climate plans. It's unclear, however, whether these promises might translate into votes. When German leaders have debated the issue, they haven't differed much in their messaging, and the conversation quickly turns to technicalities, which isn't drawing public interest. The daily newspaper Die Welt even suggested it might be Norway delivers an electoral blow to climate With climate quite firmly on the ballot in Canada and Germany, the question now is, ""Can climate actually win?"" German's Greens are polling with around 16% of the vote, though it was a few weeks ago polling roughly the same as the two mainstream parties. After decades on the fringe, it's the first time even the thought of winning is a possibility. The Greens in Germany were once a one-policy party, but now, under the leadership of Annalena Baerbock, it has a position on many things, from the country's role in the EU, to the future of the transatlantic alliance NATO and relations with Russia and China. Broadening the agenda is the only way for Green or climate-centered parties anywhere to have a realistic chance of election. Even for some voters for whom the climate crisis is a priority, voting for a one-policy party can feel impractical. A number of elections have been called ""climate elections"" in the past, but that hasn't often meant transformative change in politics. Results in Norway are a case in point, and a sobering reminder of just how slow political change can be. The Green Party there was projected to surge in last Monday's vote and was widely expected to become a kingmaker in coalition talks, but it has instead been sidelined, as the center-left Labour Party tries to form a new government without it. Norway is Europe's second-biggest oil producer, after Russia, and the future of its oil industry, and how it sits at odds with the country's otherwise laudable climate credentials, was central to the election campaign. The Greens were the only one calling for an immediate end to more oil and gas exploration, and they wanted to phase out oil production altogether by 2035. The party did win three seats, two more than it previously had, but the result was well below expectations. The Greens' secretary, Torkil Vederhus, expressed frustration that even the dramatic summer was insufficient to convince the Norwegian people that the climate crisis should be their first concern. Interest in climate issues among voters surged during the country's heatwave and as fires devastated other European nations, and after the release of the IPCC report. But that interest faded, highlighting just how short voters' attention spans can be. ""I'm kind of at a loss right now on how to get the message across, actually,"" Vederhus told CNN. But politics never ends with an election, and the way Verdhus sees it, the Greens' surge in the period before the vote forced other parties to make promises on climate. The Greens now intend to hold them accountable on those, he said. ""We think that all the parties have promised a lot on climate during the election, so there's been a shift in campaigning,"" Verdhus said. ""And now there's quite a big expectation on that climate policy being delivered.""","In Canada and Germany, the climate crisis is finally on the ballot. But can it win?"

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/02/politics/texas-abortion-supreme-court-sb8-roe-wade/index.html,"CNN The Supreme Court formally denied The The law allows private citizens to bring civil suits against anyone who assists a pregnant person seeking an abortion in violation of the ban. In an unsigned opinion, the majority wrote that while the clinics had raised ""serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law,"" they had not met a burden that would allow the court to block it at this time due to ""complex"" and ""novel"" procedural questions. The majority stressed that it had not formed a conclusion about the constitutionality of the law - despite the order coming nearly 24 hours after the law, the tightest abortion restrictions since the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade, took effect. ""In particular, this order is not based on any conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas's law, and in no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the Texas law, including in Texas state courts,"" the majority wrote. There were several dissents. In one, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by her two liberal colleagues, called the majority's order ""stunning."" ""Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""No federal appellate court has upheld such a comprehensive prohibition on abortions before viability under current law,"" she wrote. ""Taken together, the Act is a breathtaking act of defiance - of the Constitution, of this Court's precedents, and of the rights of women seeking abortions throughout Texas."" Under normal circumstances a dissenting justice ""respectfully dissents."" Sotomayor simply wrote, ""I dissent"" - revealing her deep frustration. ""The Court should not be so content to ignore its constitutional obligations to protect not only the rights of women, but also the sanctity of its precedents and of the rule of law, "" she said. Justice Stephen Breyer also omitted the ""respectfully"" from his dissent. After it took effect early Wednesday morning, clinics across Texas  Roberts dissents, says court needed more time Roberts said that he voted to block the law for now to give the court more time to consider the unusual statute. Roberts said that the state Legislature had imposed a ""prohibition on abortions after roughly six weeks"" and then ""essentially delegated enforcement of that prohibition to the populace at large"" with the consequence of insulating the state from the responsibility of enforcing the law. The law was designed to make it much more difficult to bring a pre-enforcement challenge because there are not the usual government officials to hold accountable in court. The law allows any person - as long as they're not a government official - to bring a civil lawsuit in state court against a provider accused of violating the ban, regardless of whether the person bringing the lawsuit has any connection to the abortion being sought. If they prevail, they are entitled to at least $10,000 in damages, and the law is structured to make it especially costly for clinics that are targeted with an enforcement action. It prohibits clinics from recouping attorneys' fees from their court foes, even if a judge sides with the provider in the lawsuit. The measure also prevents clinics from seeking to transfer the cases to venues more convenient for them, unless they have the agreement of their opponents.  ""Complete strangers will now be empowered to inject themselves in the most private and personal health decisions faced by women,"" he said. Biden said he was launching a ""whole of government"" effort to respond to the law, tasking the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department ""to see what steps the Federal Government can take to ensure that women in Texas have access to safe and legal abortions."" Future of Roe v. Wade But by letting the law take effect, the conservative majority may already have tipped its hand on whether it is poised to reverse or at least undercut Roe v. Wade, the ruling that declared women's constitutional right to end a pregnancy. Roberts' dissent likely signals the divisions to come. ""Alone among the conservatives, Chief Justice Roberts calls out the Texas law for what it is - a transparent attempt not just to undermine Roe, but to make it hard for such a restriction to be blocked,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. ""It's a pretty powerful sign that he, at least, is not ready to overrule Roe,"" Vladeck added. ""But the million-dollar question that the 5-4 vote raises is whether, when the time comes, any of the other conservatives will join him."" Key conservatives such as Justice Clarence Thomas have not been shy in the past to vociferously express their opinion on the court's abortion docket. In 2019, Thomas, who has publicly said Roe was wrongly decided, declared that abortion jurisprudence has ""spiraled out of control."" And last year, Justice Neil Gorsuch did not mince his words about the court and abortion, saying: ""We have lost our way."" All three of President Donald Trump's appointees - Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - voted with the majority to let the Texas law remain in effect.

One day later, it all fell apart. Beijing's decision to yank the In the year that followed, the Chinese government's regulatory might has changed industries ranging from tech and finance to gaming, entertainment and private education. China's regulators aren't alone in moving to restrict what they see as overly powerful companies, especially in Big Tech. Authorities in the United States and Europe have also moved over the last year to rein in unruly players But the speed and ferocity with which Chinese authorities have acted against the country's corporate titans have startled even the closest China watchers. ""The latest regulatory tightening cycle is unprecedented in terms of duration, intensity, scope, and velocity,"" The campaign has wiped out more than $1 trillion worldwide from the market value of Chinese Some of China's While China's decisions have rocked the corporate world and rattled foreign investors, Xi appears undeterred. To him, reining in private enterprise is the solution to fixing longstanding concerns about consumer rights, data privacy, excess debt and economic inequality. In other words, for the Chinese Communist Party ""Common prosperity is the prosperity of all the people, the material and spiritual life of the people being rich,"" Xi wrote in Dividing the 'cake' China is one of the world's most unequal major economies, according to the That meteoric Under Deng, the country embraced the free market and opened up to global trade. He famously said in 1985 that ""some people can get rich first"" to help poorer people in the long run, so that the society can gradually achieve ""common prosperity"" -- a use of the phrase that differed significantly from its invocation by Mao, who advocated for wealth redistribution nearly 70 years ago as he worked to cement the party's control. Worsening inequality now appears to be vexing Xi, the country's most powerful leader in decades. Just last year, his government concluded a five-year long fight ""We must divide the cake well,"" Xi wrote in last month's article, adding that his goal is to ""achieve common prosperity of all people by the middle of this century."" A desire for control Analysts widely believe that Xi's concerns about inequality are real, but that the unfolding crackdown also signals the ruling Chinese Communist Party's desire for control. Xi is ""aware that a Communist Party regime only enjoys legitimacy as long as common people feel represented,"" said Sonja Opper, a professor at Bocconi University The business crackdown that dominated much of this year is believed to have started after Ma -- easily the most recognizable of China's business elite -- blasted China's financial system during a Ma criticized China's regulatory system at the time as being outdated and risk averse, an obstacle to the high flying, innovative tech firms that he said could bring banking to poor populations and smaller businesses that are otherwise locked out of traditional finance. The tech entrepreneur also accused China's conventional, state-controlled banks of having a ""pawn shop"" mentality by lending only to borrowers who could provide collateral. Those words likely spurred Beijing to retaliate swiftly. The Ant Group IPO was suspended just over a week later. Since then, life has only gotten more difficult for Ma, Ant Group and China's other corporate giants. The usually flamboyant Ma has all but Ant Group was forced to More than Jack Ma Ma's business empire isn't the only one affected.

Authorities have announced more than 400 regulations on the sector this year as they try to The government has also turned its attention to cultural and societal issues that authorities have deemed ""unhealthy"" or ""toxic,"" including Wary of private tech's power Experts point to the crackdown -- and especially the measures directed at technology -- as the start of a new era for regulation in China. Companies like Ant Group and Didi have rapidly ascended in recent years to become powerhouses in their fields. Alipay, operated by Ant Group, dominates China's mobile payment market with a 56% share. Didi has Beijing encouraged their rise at first. Such firms have been huge job creators and have attracted vast amounts of foreign and domestic capital. China's influence as a hub for technological innovation has also exploded in recent years because of these firms, which compete head to head with Western rivals. But now the government is growing wary of their size and power. Firms like Alibaba, Tencent and Didi ""will no longer be able to stay under the protective umbrella of Internet or technology, outside of supervision from the Chinese government,"" said Doug Guthrie, a professor and director of China Initiatives at Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management. Beijing is also clearly concerned about the collection of data by these private firms. The technology they have created is so prevalent in Chinese life that they have access to sensitive information about hundreds of millions of ""It cannot go unnoticed that the industries and sectors that came under fire are all part of the modern tech economy, controlling vast amounts of individual level data,"" said Opper from Bocconi University. She added that data ""is an invaluable resource for any government wishing to control all walks of life."" Beijing's interest in Big Data was apparent this summer, as the government's probe of Didi and other Chinese companies that trade in the United States took shape. Authorities Those regulations ""may therefore simply reflect the desire to gain control over the type of data and technology that is currently controlled by China's most innovative, private technology corporations,"" Opper said. Economic slump may bring change of pace Beijing has signaled the crackdown may not be over yet. In August, the party's top leaders unveiled But other factors might force the government to slow the pace and scale at which it is trying to transform private enterprise. The world's second largest economy has encountered a slew of challenges that are weighing heavily on economic growth, including disruptions due to the global shipping crisis, a massive energy crunch and concerns about a debt crisis in real estate. Last quarter marked the slowest pace of GDP growth in a year. The crackdown on tech and education firms hasn't helped, with demands for rapid change resulting in job losses and a drag on retail sales. ""My prediction: The 'crackdown' is going to stop now,"" Guthrie said. ""The Xi administration is very committed to economic growth,"" he added. ""They have made their point about the coordination between the government and the private sector. But they know they need an entrepreneurial private sector to continue to drive China's growth."" There has been some indication that the regulatory push is slowing down. Guo Shuqing, chairman of Even Ma is reportedly turning up in public The government wants companies to understand that they need to be in ""lock step"" with authorities, said Guthrie, who added that ""no one gets to think of themselves as bigger or more global than the Chinese government.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/06/china/china-covid-inner-mongolia-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN As the world grapples with the new Omicron coronavirus variant, China is Since October 17, China has reported at least one locally transmitted case everyday, as local outbreaks continue to flare up one after another with increasingly short intermissions. While its caseload pales in comparison with those of many countries - For more than a year, China has been highly efficient in curbing local outbreaks with mass testing, snap lockdowns, vigilant surveillance and extensive quarantines - all the while keeping the border tightly sealed. As proof of the success of these measures, not a single Covid-related death has been reported in the country since late January. More recently, however, authorities have resorted to ever more stringent measures, quarantining not only residents who have been in direct contact with an infected person, but also secondary contacts and people who happen to be in the same general area at about the same time. In the past seven weeks, nearly 10,000 tourists were trapped in Inner Mongolia for a week after a lockdown was imposed over dozens of cases; These strict measures eventually succeeded in bringing infections in those specific localities down to zero - but not for long. Over the past week, more than 300 cases have been reported in Inner Mongolia, this time in Manzhouli, a crucial port of entry bordering Russia. The local government imposed a snap lockdown, and the city is currently rolling out a 9th round of mass testing for its more than 150,000 residents - but that still isn't quick enough in the eyes of higher authorities. Over the weekend, the city fired two officials for their ""slow and weak response"" to the outbreak - one for delaying the transfer and quarantine of more than 100 close contacts, and the other for his poor management of quarantine hotels, state media reported. Another four officials were criticized for their lackluster performances. Local officials across China have been fired or punished for failing to contain Covid flare-ups. The goal to keep infections at zero has placed tremendous pressure on local authorities - often sending them into overdrive in imposing unnecessarily draconian measures, sometimes at the disproportionate expense of disruption of daily lives. While mainstream Chinese public opinion still appears to support the government's zero-Covid policy, excessive local measures have sparked discontent and criticism in some regions, such as the southwestern border town of Ruili and the Ili prefecture in Xinjiang. In addition to Inner Mongolia, cases have been detected over the past week in the country's largest cities, from Beijing and Shanghai to Guangzhou. The provinces of Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Hebei and Yunnan also reported cases. China remains A It concluded that China should not give up zero-Covid for the time being, until there are ""more efficient vaccinations or more specific treatment, preferably the combination of both."" Over the weekend, Zhong Nanshan, a top Chinese respiratory disease expert and government adviser, proposed two prerequisites for the lifting of the zero-tolerance approach: one is for the fatality rate of Covid-19 to drop to around 0.1%, and the other is for the basic reproduction number of Covid to drop between 1 and 1.5, meaning every infected person will spread the virus to an average of 1 to 1.5 people in a susceptible population.

Launched months before Facebook's big investment, JioMart now operates across more than 200 Indian cities.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/business/evergrande-china-property-ghost-towns-intl-hnk/index.html," For weeks, the ailing Chinese real estate conglomerate has Chinese authorities finally weighed in on the Evergrande crisis on Friday. The People's Bank of China said the company had mismanaged its business but risks to the financial system were ""controllable."" ""In recent years, the company has failed to manage its business well and to operate in accordance with market changes,"" Zou Lan, director of the financial market department at the Chinese central bank, said at a press briefing. ""Instead, it blindly diversified and expanded, resulting in serious deterioration of its operating and financial indicators, which eventually led to risks."" The warning signs have been flashing for some time. Prior to Evergrande's meltdown, tens of millions of apartments were thought to be Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, estimates that China still has about 30 million unsold properties, which could house 80 million people. That's nearly the entire population of Germany. On top of that, about 100 million properties have likely been bought but not occupied, which could accommodate roughly 260 million people, according to Capital Economics estimates. Such projects have attracted scrutiny for years, and even been dubbed China's Here's a look at some of those projects, and how the problem first originated. Real estate and related sectors are a massive part of China's economy, accounting for as much as 30% of GDP. The proportion of economic output related to construction and adjacent activities is ""far higher than in other major economies,"" according to Williams. For decades, that has helped the country sustain rapid economic growth. But for years, critics have questioned whether that engine of growth was creating a ticking time bomb for the world's second largest economy. That's in part because of the massive debt many developers took on to finance their projects. As China's most indebted developer, Evergrande has become the poster child of unsustainable growth, with more than $300 billion worth of liabilities. However, ""Evergrande is not the only one struggling,"" noted Christina Zhu, an economist at Moody's Analytics. Over the last few days, a In a recent report, Zhu wrote that 12 Chinese real estate firms defaulted on bond payments totaling about 19.2 billion yuan (nearly $3 billion) in the first half of the year. ""This accounted for near 20% of total corporate bond defaults in the first six months of the year, the highest across all sectors"" in mainland China, she added. The pandemic brought activity to a temporary standstill. But construction later roared back to life as China reopened, and the country's property market enjoyed a brief rebound. Since then, however, the market has sputtered again. And there's no sign of immediate relief. Over the last few months, ""measures of price growth, housing [construction] starts and sales"" have tapered off considerably, Zhu noted. In August, property sales, as measured by floor space sold, dropped 18% compared to the same time the previous year, she added. That same month, new home prices edged up 3.5% ""from a year earlier, the smallest growth since the property market rebounded from the pandemic fallout in June 2020,"" wrote Zhu. ""Residential property demand in China is entering an era of sustained decline,"" Williams wrote in a research note. He called this ""the root of Evergrande's troubles -- and those of other highly-leveraged developers."" Then there is the problem of unfinished projects, even if there is demand. The majority of new properties in China -- about 90% -- are sold before being completed, meaning that any setbacks for home builders could directly impact buyers, according to economists. ""[This] gives the authorities a strong incentive to ensure that ongoing projects continue as failing developers are restructured,"" said Williams. According to recent analysis from Bank of America, Evergrande has sold 200,000 housing units that have not yet been handed over to buyers. That has exacerbated fears that home buyers may be left empty-handed by the country's In recent weeks, the government has turned its focus to limiting fallout from the crisis and protecting ordinary people. In a statement late last month that did not refer specifically to Evergrande, the People's Bank of China Zou, the central bank official, said Friday that Evergrande was an isolated phenomenon. ""The domestic real estate market has maintained stable land prices, housing prices, and expectations. Most real estate companies operate steadily and have good financial indicators. The real estate industry is generally healthy,"" he told reporters.

By one measure, he said, the crackdown is a ""belated response"" to the breakneck pace at which many Chinese companies have grown and innovated. He predicted the rest of the world would follow with strict regulations on data usage and the dominance of Big Tech. ""Regulatory risk has increased, but it is now largely priced in -- on our measures,"" Paolini said, adding that China is the third cheapest ""major"" equity market and BlackRock's strategists echoed that rationale, writing that the Chinese leadership sees the measures as ""necessary to rein in the industries that have been rapidly growing and lightly regulated.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/13/europe/climate-norway-election-intl/index.html,"CNN Norway's main opposition Labour Party is beginning coalition talks to form a government Tuesday after the ruling Conservatives lost their command in parliamentary elections and the anti-oil Greens failed to win enough seats to become the potential kingmaker. Labour is likely to form an alliance with the country's Center Party and the Socialist Left Party, following an election campaign period heavily focused on the climate crisis and the future of the country's Norway is Europe's second-biggest oil-producing nation, after Russia, and the world's third-biggest natural gas exporter. Even with political will, phasing out fossil fuels was unlikely to be quick. But the future of fossil fuels in the country became a hot-button issue in the election period, as oil contributes significantly to the nation's wealth but sits at odds with Norway's other credentials as a global climate leader. The results unseat Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who after eight years of rule became Norway's longest-serving Conservative leader. Solberg has refused to put an end date on fossil fuel production, planning for its continuation beyond 2050. But her ouster wasn't the boon for climate some had projected. Polling ahead of the election and early results had suggested the Greens would win enough seats to force Labour to accept it in its coalition. Labour leader Jonas Gahr Store, a  former foreign minister, is seen generally as a pro-oil figure. His party is supporting the continued production of oil, although it has indicated new exploration should be limited. But after more results came in overnight, the Greens' hopes for gains had evaporated, and by Tuesday morning, the party appeared to have lost its position as an obvious member of the coalition. In remarks to party supporters, Store said that he would invite leaders of ""all parties who want a change"" to come forward for talks. ""It is natural to start with the Center Party and SV [Socialists], our preferred partners,"" he said, adding he would also ""listen"" to the Greens and Reds, another smaller socialist party. ""In this election, the Labour Party had a goal that was more important than anything other than a new government, a change in Norway after eight years of right-wing politics and increased differences, a government based on community and justice so that it is the turn of ordinary people."" Store appeared to target the other key election issue of inequality over climate, saying that his government would pursue a policy for a ""fairer Norway with less differences."" He also said that his government would pursue ""a fair climate policy that cuts emissions and creates jobs,"" and that ""take the sides of ordinary people,"" including ""young people who demand that we do everything in our power to save the Earth from the climate crisis."" According to a full preliminary count of the vote, Labour secured some 26% of the ballots, which translates to 48 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The eurosceptic Progess Party came in third, but is an unlikely Labour ally. The smaller Center Party and the Socialist Left Party gained 28 and 13 seats, respectively. The Greens ended with just three seats, two more than it already had. The results will be made official when a final count is completed. A climate paradox The Socialists have a stronger climate agenda than Labour, so they could still have some influence over the country's future energy policies. Lars-Henrik Paarup Michelsen, the director of the Norwegian Climate Foundation, said Labour needed the support of at least one green party to achieve command of parliament. Despite the results, he said, the elections had but the climate crisis more firmly in public debate and on the government's agenda. ""Everyone expects that climate policy will be tightened after the election,"" he added. But Fay Farstad, a senior researcher at CICERO, a Norwegian institute for interdisciplinary climate research, said the gains posted by the Center Party indicate the debate around oil is not so clear cut. ""They support Norway's climate goals and agreements, but where they differ is on the issue on CO2 tax increases. They ran on the platform of rejecting it,"" she said. Norwegians enjoy a high standard of living by many measures, largely because of its $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund - the biggest in the world - which invests revenues from the oil industry. Its The country's approach to the climate crisis has been The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said earlier this year that it expected oil production to keep rising in the next few years, from 1.7 million barrels a day in 2020 to just over 2 million a day in 2025.

The UN report found that climate change was happening faster than scientists previously thought and was published as much of the Northern Hemisphere battled heatwaves, wildfires and flooding. In Norway, a country that generally experiences cooler climes, was scorched in parts by a heatwave during the summer. While climate change itself is not up for a debate in Norway - all of the main political parties acknowledge climate change is real and already happening - the question of how to handle it is.

""This is an urgent global challenge and we need to step up to it. The science is clear and has been for years."" The one-in-400-year frequency only refers to the particular region studied and does not mean it will be another 400 years until other parts of Europe, or the world, will see a similar weather event, explained Maarten van Aalst, a professor of climate and disaster resilience from the University of Twente in the Netherlands. ""In this case, [the projection for next year is] possibly worse because, year by year, if the trend so far is that the climate is increasing, the risk will continue to grow. So, if anything, we're expecting a higher chance of this happening next year than this year. But it's basically a one-over-400 chance every single year,"" van Aalst said at a news conference. The scientists focused on the areas around the Ahr and Erft rivers in Germany and the Meuse in Belgium, where rainfall records were broken. But they also took into account what was happening across a larger region, including parts of France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland, to establish how the extreme weather event had been influenced by increasing global temperatures. The scientists looked at weather records and used computer simulations to compare the picture today - in a world that is 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in pre-industrial times - to that of the late 1800s. They warned that the warmer Earth gets, the more frequent and intense these rain events will be. Specifically, if global temperatures rose to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the intensity of rain in a single day would increase by a further 0.8 to 6% and would be between 1.2 and 1.4 times more likely to happen, their models project. River measurement stations destroyed Van Aalst said that the findings should be a ""wake-up call"" for governments and local leaders to improve their preparedness for extreme weather events, including looking at how homes are constructed so that children, the elderly and people with disabilities can reach safety in events like floods or fires. ""I hope it's a wake-up call also to people that have not just been affected by this one, but also people elsewhere - because it's been heatwaves elsewhere, where I could tell a similar story,"" he said. ""We are just facing more extreme events of many kinds, and the only thing we can do is, on the one hand, closing the tap off the increase in greenhouse gases to avoid the risk of getting further out of hand, and on the other hand, preparing for that more extreme climate."" The scientists acknowledged their estimate - 1.2 to 9 times more likely, due to climate change - was a wide range, and explained that the models they used and the data available to them around such localized events prevented them from narrowing their findings down further. They were also missing crucial data, as some measurement stations were destroyed by the floods. The study acknowledged that a number of conditions had worsened the severity of the floods, including that the soil in the region was already saturated, and that the terrain in some locations, with narrow valleys and steep sloping mountains, led ""to funnel-like effects in the event of extreme floods."" Those factors were taken into account in their models. This summer, the Northern Hemisphere has experienced wide range of extreme weather events beyond deadly flooding, including record-breaking temperatures that in some instances have triggered wildfires in the US, Canada, Siberia, Algeria and southern Europe. On August 14, The US state of Tennessee is now experiencing heavy rains and deadly floods, as the National Weather Service in Nashville reported more than 17 inches of rain in the city of McEwen, possibly setting a new state record for 24-hour rainfall.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/politics/abortion-clinics-six-week-ban-texas-impacts/index.html,"CNN Access to abortion was curtailed significantly in Texas on Wednesday, with Clinics across the state - the second most populous in the country - drastically limited their services, as the law prohibits physicians from conducting the procedure when a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is often before a woman knows she is pregnant. Whole Woman's Health, which operates four clinics in Texas, is offering abortion services ""only if no embryonic or fetal cardiac activity is detected in the sonogram,"" according to a spokesperson, and several other providers also are taking that limited approach. The providers brought a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Texas' law, pointing to the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which enshrined a nationwide right to an abortion prior to viability, a point about 24 weeks into pregnancy. Late Wednesday night, the Supreme Court said it would not block the law from taking effect. The Texas measure was designed to make such a challenge difficult to bring. By tasking private citizens - who are empowered by the law to bring civil litigation against those who violate the six-week ban - instead of government officials with enforcement of the prohibition, the Texas legislature scrambled the usual legal route that abortion rights advocates have taken in getting courts to block other extreme restrictions before they can be implemented. Tens of thousands of Texas women seeking abortions will likely be unable to access them. Many women do not even know they are pregnant at six weeks, and according to the law's opponents at least 85% of abortions in Texas happen after that point in pregnancy. Some of those women may be able to travel out of state to obtain abortions. The ban's impact will fall most heavily on lower-income people - who don't have the time or resources for such trips - as well as people of color. Taken together, Black, Asian and Latina individuals made up most of the people obtaining abortions in Texas, The procedure itself costs around $550 in Texas and cannot be covered by public or private insurance, according to Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst at the reproductive rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. The expense of traveling out of state will escalate that cost dramatically. The nearest clinics are in Louisiana - which is currently reeling from a hurricane - and that can be a three-and-a-half hour drive for many Texans and nine hours for those in its Rio Grande valley. The travel costs can be compounded by residual costs like child care and lost wages from time taken off work. ""All of those costs compound to make it very unreachable for a lot of people,"" said Zaena Zamora, the executive director of the Frontera Fund, which offers tactical and financial assistance for abortion seekers in southeastern Texas. Clinics scramble as the ban goes into force Even before midnight struck in Texas and the abortion ban went into effect Wednesday, providers said they were subject to an uptick in surveillance and harassment from anti-abortion activists, who now have the power to bring private enforcement actions under the law. ""The protesters called the police twice and the fire department once (on Tuesday) in Fort Worth, all in their attempts to say there were too many patients, to try to find some law that we were breaking,"" said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the CEO of Whole Woman's Health, which operates a clinic in Fort Worth. Hagstrom Miller, speaking on a call with reporters, said the protesters shined giant lights on the clinic's parking lot. At 10 p.m. local time, the clinic had 27 patients left in the waiting room, Hagstrom Miller said, and the last procedure was completed at 11:56 p.m., just before the ban went into effect. The law allows any person - as long as they're not a government official - to bring a civil lawsuit in state court against a provider accused of violating the ban, regardless of whether the person bringing the lawsuit has any connection to the abortion being sought. If they prevail, they are entitled to at least $10,000 in damages, and the law is structured to make it especially costly for clinics that are targeted with an enforcement action. It prohibits clinics from recouping attorneys' fees from their court foes, even if a judge sides with the provider in the lawsuit. The measure also prevents clinics from seeking to transfer the cases to venues more convenient for them, unless they have the agreement of their opponents. Because of the way the litigative deck is stacked against them, clinics and other abortion access proponents implicated by the ban - including abortion funds and groups that provide other transport for abortion-seekers - are planning to fully comply with it until there is a court order blocking the law. In addition to this chilling effect, the measure comes with the potential that it will shutter clinics, even if they are ultimately found not to have violated the law. ""Even if the defendants won every single case, the burden of having to defend themselves, of having attorneys spending their time, having to go around in rural courts all over Texas - 258 counties - defending themselves, that alone threatens to stop the provision of abortion access across the state,"" said Marc Hearron, a senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the clinics in their federal challenge to the law. A 'target' on the backs of groups that facilitate abortion access Another notable aspect of the ban is how it targets not just physicians, but anyone who ""knowingly"" assists a woman in getting an abortion after six weeks, or even anyone who ""intends"" to help women access illegal abortions. The Lilith Fund, Texas' oldest abortion fund, has been preparing for the measure since it was signed into law in May, according to the organization's communications director, Cristina Parker. The group is shifting its focus to getting funding to women so they can access the procedure before the six-week cutoff or helping them travel out of state. ""We knew the target was on our back as soon as this bill was filed in the spring,"" Parker said. Limits that GOP Gov. Greg Abbott put on the procedure for a few months during the beginning of the pandemic offer a preview of how the new ban could play out if it is allowed to stand. Women traveled as far as Colorado or Virginia to get abortions, according to Nash of the Guttmacher Institute. Jane's Due Process, an organization that helps teens navigate accessing abortion when they don't have their parents' permission, saw only a handful of those young people obtain abortions when the pandemic limitations were in place. The organization usually helps at least 350 teens obtain abortions annually, said the group's executive director, Rosann Mariappuram. During that period, the Lilith Fund also saw requests for financial assistance wane, because women were having trouble even getting appointments at out-of-state clinics. Already, the Frontera Fund has seen a ""huge decrease"" in call volume in the past two weeks, Zamora said, because the sole clinic in her organization's area was already booked up in the anticipation of the ban going into effect. Still, even as clinics and the organizations that facilitate access to them drastically shift their approach in accordance with the ban, they feel vulnerable to legal attacks from anti-abortion activists that the new law makes possible. ""Our very existence is creating a risk,"" Zamora said. ",How Texas' 6-week abortion ban will make accessing the procedure nearly impossible for some

""The dog tried to avoid the beating and fled into the bedroom, and therefore it wasn't recorded by surveillance camera, but (I) could hear faint wails. A few minutes later, they said they've dealt with it and would take it away, holding a yellow plastic bag in their hands,"" she wrote in a since-deleted post. ""Even now I don't know whether my dog is alive or dead, and where it has been taken,"" she added. In a statement late on Saturday, the local government of Xinzhou district, where the complex is located, confirmed the dog was killed as part of the need to ""thoroughly disinfect"" homes in the community. But it admitted Covid prevention workers had ""safely disposed"" of the dog without communicating fully with the owner. The workers involved had been criticized and removed from their positions, it said, adding they had apologized to the owner and gained her understanding. On Weibo, however, the owner claimed she was pressured by local authorities and her employer to delete her posts. CNN has reached out to the owner, who was not named by the government, and the Jiangxi provincial government for comment. It's not the first time Chinese authorities have killed pets as part of their stringent Covid response. In September, Not all local governments are as stringent when it comes to dealing with pets, however. In January, Shanghai authorities Animals in different countries have contracted Covid-19, including domestic pets, zoo animals and livestock, with humans the primary source of these infections. But although scientists say Covid-19 likely originated in animals before becoming widespread among humans, there is no evidence animals are playing a significant role in the spread of the virus to people, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And in the latest incident, the dog was killed before it was even tested for Covid, according to the owner. ""When they hadn't even confirmed whether the dog was negative or positive (for Covid), they barged into the owner's home and beat the dog to death. Is this the management level of the government?"" a top comment on Weibo said. In its statement, the district government said residents had been asked not to lock their doors before they left for quarantine, and Covid prevention workers opened the owner's door by force under the witness of police officers. The move has sparked a fierce backlash from pet owners and sympathizers, while others see it as a necessary sacrifice for the ""greater good"" of society, arguing that human lives are more important than animals'. But for some, there is another crucial question to be asked: just how much more power has the government amassed in the name of Covid prevention, at the cost of individual rights and liberties? ""From the earlier killing of the three cats to today's killing of the dog, it's getting worse and worse. The so-called debate around 'animal rights' is merely a camouflage - the issue at heart here has always been the wanton infringement of individual (rights) by the endlessly expanding state power,"" a comment on Chinese social media site Douban said.",The killing of a corgi shows how government power has grown unchecked in China in the name of Covid prevention
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/29/china/china-covid-omicron-response-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN As Despite two confirmed cases of the heavily mutated variant in Hong Kong, Chinese public health experts have expressed confidence in the country's existing border control measures. China's response - or the lack thereof - is hardly surprising. Zhang Wenhong, an infectious disease expert in Shanghai and arguably China's most trusted voice on Covid-19, said the new variant would have ""no major impact on China at this time."" ""China's current rapid response and dynamic clearance strategy is capable of dealing with all types of new coronavirus variants,"" Zhang wrote in a social media post Sunday. And at a conference in Guangzhou over the weekend, Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory disease expert and government adviser, said China has no plans to take any ""major action"" in response to the Omicron variant. Meanwhile, in Chinese state media the prevailing mood is one of apparent vindication. As much of the world started to reopen and learn to live with Covid, China dug its heels and looked increasingly isolated by comparison. That isolation is now being extolled as a uniquely Chinese advantage in the fight against the new variant. ""Major Western countries have cut air links with countries such as South Africa, showing that these countries are frightened. Establishing an immune shield based on the vaccine alone has actually proved to be a risky route, and can even be said to have failed to a large extent,"" the Global Times, a state-run nationalist tabloid, said in an editorial Sunday. ""China's dynamic zero-case route has been criticized in the West in many ways. However, if the Omicron variant launches a new wave of attack, it is China that will be best able to block its invasion,"" said the editorial, which went on to declare China ""a true impregnable fortress against the spread of the virus in the world today."" Just how ""impregnable"" China's defense is against new variants is a question up for debate, given the Delta variant has Nevertheless, the growing global concern and spate of travel bans sparked by the Omicron variant is most likely to lend domestic public support for the Chinese government to maintain its zero-tolerance approach on Covid for as long as it sees fit. The ruling Communist Party has tied the zero-Covid policy to its political legitimacy, touting it as evidence of the supposed superiority of its one-party system over Western democracies, especially the United States. But the strategy is also driven by pure necessity, because China simply could not afford to open up without more efficient vaccines or treatments. A In the report published in China CDC Weekly by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the mathematicians assessed the potential results if China adopted the same pandemic control tactics as countries like the United States, Britain, Spain, France and Israel. If China were to adopt the pandemic strategy of the US, its daily new cases would reach at least 637,155, the study found. ""The estimates revealed the real possibility of a colossal outbreak which would almost certainly induce an unaffordable burden on the medical system,"" ""Our findings have raised a clear warning that, for the time being, we are not ready to embrace 'open-up' strategies resting solely on the hypothesis of herd immunity induced by vaccination advocated by certain western countries."" It concluded, ""more efficient vaccinations or more specific treatment, preferably the combination of both, are needed before entry-exit quarantine measures and other Covid-19 response strategies in China can be safely lifted."" Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China's CDC, was quick to share the findings While acknowledging that there were ""some different opinions"" toward the approach among the public, Wu stressed that zero-tolerance containment and border restrictions are absolutely necessary for the coming months. ""We must stick to it, at least through this winter and next spring,""",China extols isolation as countries rush to impose Omicron travel bans
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/13/europe/putin-soviet-collapse-taxi-intl/index.html,"Russian President Putin's comments, released by state TV on Sunday, are likely to further fuel speculation about his foreign policy intentions among critics, who accuse him of planning to recreate the Soviet Union and of contemplating an attack on ""It was a disintegration of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,"" Putin said of the 1991 breakup, in comments aired on Sunday as part of a documentary film called ""Russia. New History,"" the RIA state news agency reported. ""We turned into a completely different country. And what had been built up over 1,000 years was largely lost,"" said Putin, saying 25 million Russian people in newly independent countries suddenly found themselves cut off from Russia, part of what he called ""a major humanitarian tragedy."" Putin also described for the first time how he was affected personally by the tough economic times that followed the Soviet collapse, when Russia suffered double-digit inflation. ""Sometimes (I) had to moonlight and drive a taxi. It is unpleasant to talk about this but, unfortunately, this also took place,"" the president said. Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, has previously called the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was ruled from Moscow, as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century, but his new comments show how he viewed it specifically as a setback for Russian power. Ukraine was one of 15 Soviet republics and Putin used a lengthy article published on the Kremlin website this year to set out why he believed Russia's southern neighbor and its people were an integral part of Russian history and culture. This view is rejected by Kiev as a politically motivated and over-simplified version of history. The West has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in preparation for a possible attack as soon as January. The Group of Seven wealthy democracies warned Moscow on Sunday of massive consequences and severe costs if it attacked Ukraine. The Kremlin has said Russia has no plans to launch a fresh attack on Ukraine and that the West appears to have convinced itself of Moscow's aggressive intentions based on what it calls false Western media stories. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and has backed separatists who took control of a swath of eastern Ukraine that same year and who continue to fight Ukrainian government forces.","Putin rues Soviet collapse, says he moonlit as a taxi driver to survive economic crisis"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/31/politics/texas-six-week-abortion-ban-supreme-court-explainer/index.html,"CNN A The measure - signed into law by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May - prohibits abortion providers from conducting abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected. It would effectively outlaw at least 85% of the abortions sought in the state, according to opponents of the law, since that point is around six weeks into the pregnancy, before some women know they're pregnant. The law It was passed But among those restrictions, the Texas bill stands out for the novel approach it takes in curtailing the procedure. Rather than imposing a criminal or regulatory punishment for those who conduct abortions after the point in the pregnancy, the state law created a so-called ""private right of action"" to enforce the restriction. Essentially, the legislature deputized private citizens to bring civil litigation - with the threat of $10,000 or more in damages - against providers or even anyone who helped a woman access an abortion after six weeks. ""The way the bill is structured incentivizes vigilante lawsuits that will harass abortion providers and those who support providing abortions in Texas,"" Adriana Pinon, an attorney at the Texas chapter of ACLU, told CNN. The approach was aimed at insulating the law from the sort of federal legal challenges that would prevent it from going into effect. One such lawsuit - brought by several clinics represented by the ACLU and other groups - is now mired in a complicated procedural dispute that has prompted the clinics to ask for a Supreme Court intervention, which didn't come as of 1:30 a.m. ET Wednesday. The upshot is that while the legal fight plays out, providers in Texas may have to decide whether they want to risk costly litigation brought by private plaintiffs who seek damages under the state law. Anti-abortion activists are already preparing to bring lawsuits if clinics violate the six-week ban. ""This whole mechanism only works if there is a credible threat of lawsuits being brought against an industry if they decide to ignore the law,"" said John Seago, the legislative director for Texas Right to Life, which advocated prominently for the abortion ban. ""So, we have been working to make sure that all those pieces are in place, that if we do have reports, that we do see evidence that they're violating the law, then we can actually enforce the law ourselves."" (After Seago spoke to CNN, a state court on Tuesday issued temporary orders blocking Seago and his organization from bringing a private enforcement action against Seago told CNN that the push for the law was motivated in part by a letter rolled out in October by a coalition of state and local prosecutors from across the country who vowed to not enforce anti-abortion laws, even if Though previous proposals from the anti-abortion movement included civil liabilities, the Texas ban is unique in that it is structured entirely around that threat. How it expands who can sue under the measure - ""any person,"" besides a government official, ""One of the great benefits, and one of the things that's most exciting for the pro-life movement, is that they have a role in enforcing this law,"" Seago said. Impact on clinics Abortion rights advocates say that the effect of the law will fall disproportionately on lower income people who The average distance an abortion patient will have to travel once the law goes into effect will grow from 12 miles to 248 miles, The clinics will need to hire lawyers to defend themselves, and if those civil lawsuits are successful, state courts can shut the clinics down. The measure also includes a provision that will prevent clinics, even if they prevail in court, from recouping their attorney fees from their legal opponents. ""The kinds of people that are going to bring these lawsuits are the people my staff see every day,"" said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the president of Whole Woman's Health, which operates four clinics in Texas and is suing in federal court to block the law. ""They scream at them on the way to work, they know their names, they know what car they drive, and so this isn't abstract to our clinic staff and physicians."" Texas Right to Life is planning to launch a tip line for people to report evidence that the ban has been violated and Seago, the legislative director, also said that he is anticipating that ""sidewalk counselors,"" in his words, and the counselors at pregnancy centers could be involved in the lawsuits as well. Additionally, the law exposes to the civil damages anyone who ""knowingly ... aids or abets"" in the performance of abortion after the heartbeat is defected, even as it excludes from liability the woman who received the abortion. The language is vague but has prompted fears that family members who drive patients to receive abortion or donors to abortion funds that help pay for the procedure will be vulnerable to civil litigation. Will the law withstand legal challenges? Seago touted how the structure of the law - and how it empowers citizens to bring civil litigation - will make it more resilient to the type of ""back and forth"" in federal courts that have blocked abortion restrictions in the past. Typically, when a state passes an abortion restriction, abortion rights advocates bring lawsuits against the government officials - such as attorneys general or regulatory boards - in charge of enforcing a criminal or administration punishment and ask courts for orders blocking those officials from enforcing those laws before restrictions go into effect. By leaving the enforcement of the ban in the hands of private civil litigants, the Texas measure's champions hoped to deprive their legal foes the opportunity to get a federal court to block the measure before it goes into effect. At the same time, however, letting Texas move forward with this end-run around Regardless, if Texas is allowed to permanently implement the law, it appears likely that other red states would follow in using the approach to restrict abortion. ""We have already heard from states that are working on drafting some legislation that takes this approach to the enforcement mechanism,"" Seago added.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/16/china/xi-2022-challenges-covid-ukraine-russia-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN In a year when all Xi Jinping craved was for things to be stable, 2022 is shaping up to be anything but. After years of careful preparation, the Chinese leader is expected to step into an almost unprecedented third term at the helm of the country and its Communist Party this fall. But instead of a smooth ride, dual crises are threatening to upend the status-quo, with China's The war comes just weeks after Beijing declared While Xi's path to a third term may not be imperiled by these twin crises, both will need to be navigated carefully as the 68-year-old leader steers the country toward its twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle at the 20th Party Congress this fall. ""From Beijing's perspective there is no higher priority than stability ahead of the Party Congress - as we all know it's by no means an election, but this is the closest you might come to seeing a 'campaign season' in China,"" said Natasha Kassam, director of the Public Opinion and Foreign Policy Program at the Australia-based think tank the Lowy Institute. ""We know that most opposition to Xi has been eliminated ... but there is still the expectation of delivering on particular needs for the majority of people,"" she said. That may be especially true for a leader who has spent years In doing so, Xi has placed himself at the center of the party and state in a way not seen since Communist China's founding father Complicated friendship As Russian tanks, soldiers and fighter planes advanced into Ukraine from multiple sides last month, China appeared to some observers to have either been playing along - or played. Days before the invasion, Beijing continued to The importance of that meeting - the 38th between the two leaders since 2013 - was only underscored by the fact it was While views diverge on how much Xi may have known about Putin's true plans, as Russia's unprovoked invasion wears on, China's position of both saying it respects international norms, while not condemning Russia, is growing increasingly untenable. ""Now this (situation) is impossible for China - China will either have to be in support of global institutions or it will be against them. That's it,"" said Victor Shih, a professor at University of California San Diego's School of Global Policy and Strategy. ""(For China, it's turned) into a diplomatic and potentially economic headache."" That risk for China, and by extension Xi, is two-fold: on the one hand, if it violates a raft of But more pressing is the risk Beijing's stance could sink relations between China and its major trading partners in the West. Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, these ties were seeing significant strain. Washington and Beijing have been at loggerheads for several years over issues like trade, Taiwan, and China's human rights record, and there were signs Europe was moving in a similar direction. Last year, a And when it comes to Ukraine, pressure is already very much on China to choose a side, with US officials saying this week that US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday the United States is ""watching very closely the extent to which the (People's Republic of China) provides any form of support, whether that's material support, whether that's economic support, whether that's financial support to Russia."" On Tuesday, Qin Gang, China's ambassador to the US, pushed back on ""assertions that China knew about, acquiesced to or tacitly supported this war"" in an op-ed in the Washington Post, saying instead ""had China known about the imminent crisis, we would have tried our best to prevent it"" and that Beijing was committed to working for peace. All this may be making some people in Xi's China uncomfortable. ""There are certainly differences of opinion (among) Communist Party members and the business community, who are concerned with China being tied to a pariah state and concerned about falling foul of very dramatic sanctions,"" Kassam said. ""China's trade relationship with the world's democracies is many magnitudes larger than it is with Russia,"" she said. Trade between the European Union and China topped $800 billion last year and US-China trade was over $750 billion, according to China's An example of these differing opinions was on show in a ""If China does not take proactive measures to respond, it will encounter further containment from the US and the West,"" Hu wrote in a piece published in Chinese and an English translation in the US-China Perception Monitor, a publication of the US-based nonprofit The Carter Center - ""China should avoid playing both sides in the same boat, give up being neutral, and choose the mainstream position in the world,"" Hu said. But while such concerns may be bubbling under the surface, experts remain skeptical they represent a strong or even dominant view in the Communist Party, given Xi's own personal embrace of Putin in recent years. And to move away from Putin would be to risk questioning Xi. ""In the short term, (Beijing) cannot change its 'no limits' partnership with Russia because it will imply that Xi was wrong to get China into the difficult position in the first place,"" said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank. ""Xi is aiming for the third term, and this would be a main stain on his record."" Covid crisis But looming concerns about whether China's economy could be impacted by global turmoil sparked by Russia's war, or any penalties from a further break with Western partners, are coupled with another challenge to stability - both economic and political -  on China's home front. There, new Covid-19 cases have been reported in the thousands for several days in the largest outbreak in roughly two years. It's a sharp jolt for a country that has assiduously maintained a ""zero-Covid"" posture at great cost - shutting its borders to most foreigners since March 2020, rolling out a complex digital tracking system for each individual, and enacting mass testing and snap lockdowns even when a handful of cases were found. China's leaders have freely equated that policy, and its relative success at controlling Covid-19, to what they claim is the superiority of the Chinese system over that of Western democracies, where the virus spread rampantly. Such rhetoric has not only played out on Chinese state media - where the horrors of Covid-19 overseas are voraciously covered - it's also been part of Xi's own case to the world about why China is an exemplary global leader and force for good. For more than a year, analysts have suggested China would not relax its stringent zero-Covid policy, even as the rest of the world opens up, until after 2022's Party Congress was over and Xi cemented his third term - as a widespread outbreak would challenge that carefully cultivated image. ""The last thing that the Chinese leaders want is to have a nationwide, major Covid-19 outbreak that overwhelms the hospitals ... and could contribute to social and political instability,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""A government failure to effectively respond to such a crisis could translate into a legitimacy crisis (ahead of the Party Congress),"" he said. But now that risk is playing out in real time as authorities around the country race to lock down cities and stamp out cases - with no guarantee these measures will be effective against the newer and highly infectious Omicron variant. As of Tuesday, five Chinese cities with more than 37 million residents were under various forms of lockdown, and concerns have been growing over the economic fallout from China's stringent control measures. At least one major company, Apple supplier Foxconn, suspended operations in Shenzhen, before moving into a ""closed loop"" system where employees who live on campus can work, as the tech hub went under a soft lockdown after recording 66 Covid-19 cases on Saturday. A research note from analysts at financial services group Nomura on Friday said the costs of China's zero-Covid strategy ""will rise significantly as its benefits decline,"" making it ""much harder for Beijing to achieve its ""around 5.5%"" GDP growth target for 2022"" - a figure that was already the But China's leaders, and Xi, may be worrying about more than the macro-economic outlook ahead of the Party Congress, according to Lowy Institute's Kassam. If sustained, widespread lockdowns could strike at the welfare and livelihoods of the more economically vulnerable in the country - groups whose economic security has been part of That could see the government more willing to roll out tools to prop up the economy this year than in the past if Covid-19 is not brought under control swiftly, Kassam said. ""Because this one will impact 'everyman' first ...and if we come back to this idea that we are in 'campaign season' - so to speak - that becomes really important."" While headwinds from these events may have an impact on ""everyman,"" in China there is one man who is carefully surveying the landscape and pulling the strings. As these dual crises evolve during a highly sensitive year, experts will be watching closely to see to what extent Xi moves to recalibrate China's positions both overseas and at home to ensure there are no threats posed to his historic transition into a third term. Because, as China's latest government work report - often seen as the Chinese equivalent of the State of the Union address in the US - repeatedly made clear: Xi Jinping is the ""core"" of the Communist Party leadership. And it is of the highest priority to ""maintain overall social stability to welcome the victory of the 20th Party Congress.""","This was supposed to be Xi Jinping's big year. Instead, he's dealing with Covid and war"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/29/tech/reliance-amazon-future-group-india-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business Two of the world's richest men are duking it out over a brick-and-mortar retail chain on the verge of default. But when it comes to the fight for India's Amazon What's at stake is strategic access to a network of popular grocery stores and retail shops in India -- something both Amazon and Reliance want to either have for themselves, or to prevent the other from acquiring. ""If someone backs down, it will give the impression that one has lost and the other has won, when the fight has just started,"" said Counterpoint Research analyst Tarun Pathak. Amazon has 31.2% market share in India's e-commerce industry, just behind Walmart-owned Flipkart's 31.9%, according to a recent report from market research firm Forrester. But Ambani has made no secret of his ambitions to upend the market with JioMart, which is part of his sprawling conglomerate. At the heart of the current battle is Future Retail, the cash cow of Future Group. The retail unit includes brands like Big Bazaar, a well-known, popular hypermarket chain in India. In August 2019, Amazon Then Covid-19 hit. India enforced one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns, ordering shops to shutter and millions of people to stay indoors for months. The pandemic has had a ""significant adverse impact"" on Future Retail's business operations, the company said in its most recent earnings report. In July, Future Retail's credit rating took a hit after it missed a bond payment. Fitch Ratings The following month, Reliance and Future Group announced that Reliance was buying Future Retail and several other assets. The deal allowed Future Group to ""achieve a holistic solution to the challenges that have been caused by Covid and the macro economic environment,"" Kishore Biyani, Future Group CEO, said in a A legal dispute The announcement took industry watchers by surprise. ""Everyone knew Amazon had a stake in Future Retail, and the deal didn't mention what would happen to Amazon's stake,"" said Satish Meena, analyst at research firm Forrester. Amazon responded by filing a complaint to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). Indian companies and foreign companies operating in India often agree to settle disputes in Singapore because ""it's a neutral jurisdiction with high integrity and international standards,"" according to Ashish Kabra, a lawyer who heads the International Dispute Resolution & Investigations Practice for Nishith Desai Associates in Singapore. The arbitration process is confidential and none of the submissions are public. Amazon argued that the 2019 deal struck between it and the Future Group entity included a non-compete clause, a person familiar with Amazon's perspective told CNN Business. The clause listed 30 restricted parties with which Future Retail and Future Group could not do business, and Reliance was on that list, the person said. ""The key question really is what's the validity of contracts if you just ignore them,"" said the person familiar with Amazon's side. ""Are companies just going to ignore contracts and do what they please?"" A SIAC emergency arbitrator gave Amazon a small victory this week when it ordered a temporary halt on Future Group's deal with Reliance, according to the legal order seen by Future Group had argued that if the deal with Reliance falls through, its retail unit will be forced into liquidation and 29,000 people will lose their jobs, according to Reuters, which cited the Singapore order. The order is not public, but the person familiar with Amazon's perspective confirmed that Future presented this argument. But the arbitrator ruled that ""economic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations,"" according to the order, ""We welcome the award of the Emergency Arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. CNN Business contacted Future Group for comment, and received a statement from Future Retail. Future Retail said it ""is examining the communication and the order"" from SIAC. Reliance (RRVL) said in a statement that its deal with Future Retail is ""fully enforceable"" under Indian law. ""RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay,"" said the statement. But in the past, Indian courts have usually followed the lead of orders passed by emergency arbitrators outside of India, according to Kabra, the lawyer. ""What parties have previously done, is they approach Indian Courts and ask for similar reliefs in India, while relying on the order of the Emergency Arbitrator. Indian Courts usually grant the same relief,"" said Kabra. A 'clash of the titans' For Reliance, which operates 11,000 stores throughout India, and Amazon, the No. 2 e-commerce player in the country, Future Retail's 1,500 stores are not a must have, says one analyst. ""It's not like without it you can't have your ambitions, if you don't have Future [Retail],"" said Pathak, of Counterpoint Research. This is ""less about Future and more about the clash of the titans,"" as well as ""protecting your turf,"" he added. To compete with Amazon and Flipkart, Ambani's JioMart has been growing its presence in India. It expanded to hundreds of cities across India earlier this year and plans to branch into electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare soon. The company will also likely tap into Reliance Retail's network of physical stores across the country to fulfill online orders, according to analysts. The industry had expected Amazon and Reliance to forge some kind of deal in the future, because they need each other's expertise, according to Meena, of Forrester. Amazon needs more shops to expand inventory and use retail spaces as storage and delivery hubs. And Reliance doesn't have a lot of experience in e-commerce, according to Meena. But any kind of partnership between Amazon and Reliance in the future ""depends upon how much bad blood is between them now,"" said Meena. ""It might end up becoming an ego battle between the CEOs of both the companies,"" he said.",Why Amazon and Reliance are clashing in India over a cash-strapped retail chain

But Putin has said that Russia has the right to ""defend its security"" in the face of a potential eastward push by NATO. The Biden administration is still weighing whether to send more weapons and equipment to Ukrainians, following shipments in the last two months of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Command Launch Units, Island Class Patrol Boats, first aid kits, secure radios, electronics, medical equipment, engines, generators, spare parts, as well as small arms and ammunition. Ukrainian officials have also been pushing for air defense systems, like Patriot surface-to-air missiles, from the US, according to people familiar with their requests. But National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has conveyed the US' concerns that such shipments might be viewed by Russia as highly provocative, at a moment when the US, Europe and NATO are trying to get Moscow to de-escalate. Still, the White House has not ruled anything out completely, apart from putting US troops on the ground in Ukraine. ""As we pursue diplomatic channels, we will also prepare for all contingencies,"" Sullivan told reporters earlier this month. ""Just as we have been doing for weeks now, including through the preparation of specific responses to Russian escalation should they be required - specific, robust, clear responses should they be required.""",Russia continues to amass new troops near Ukraine's border despite Biden urging Putin to de-escalate tensions

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/19/weather/greenland-summit-rain-climate-change/index.html,"CNN For the first time on record, precipitation on Saturday at the summit of Greenland -- roughly two miles above sea level -- fell as rain and not snow. Temperatures at the Greenland summit over the weekend rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade. The warm air fueled an extreme rain event that dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in Washington, DC, nearly 250,000 times. It was the heaviest rainfall on the ice sheet since record keeping began in 1950, according to the Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said this is evidence Greenland is warming rapidly. ""What is going on is not simply a warm decade or two in a wandering climate pattern,"" Scambos told CNN. ""This is unprecedented."" The National Science Foundation's Summit Station is located at the highest point on the Greenland ice sheet, where scientists can observe Arctic weather and changes in the ice. The station has been staffed year-round to observe extreme changes since 1989. The majority of the weekend's rain fell from the southeast coast of Greenland up to the Summit Station. Jennifer Mercer, program officer for the Office of Polar Programs at the National Science Foundation, said because of the significant rain event, operations at the Summit Station would need to change: ""It means that we need to consider weather events that we have not had to deal with before in the history of our operations there,"" she told CNN. ""Increasing weather events including melting, high winds, and now rain, over the last 10 years have occurred outside the range of what is considered normal,"" Mercer said. ""And these seem to be occurring more and more."" As human-caused climate change warms the planet, ice loss has rapidly increased. A In July, the Greenland ice sheet experienced In 2019, Greenland shed roughly ""We are crossing thresholds not seen in millennia, and frankly this is not going to change until we adjust what we're doing to the air,"" said Scambos. Other unusual events have become more frequent, too, Mercer said. Two years ago, a polar bear made it to the Summit Station, which was unusual since polar bears live in coastal regions where they can easily find food. The bear had trekked several hundred miles inland across the ice sheet. In the last five years, Mercer said three polar bears have been sighted high on Greenland's ice sheet. According to Mercer, the rain will have a lasting effect on the properties of the snow, leaving a crust of ice behind that will absorb more energy from the sun, until it gets buried by snow. Scambos said this crusty layer will also be a barrier that prevents the downward draining of melt water, which will then flood the surface of the ice sheet and initiate run off at higher elevations. Because of the layer of ice it created, the weekend's rainfall event ""will be visible in ice core records in the future,"" Mercer said.",Rain fell at the normally snowy summit of Greenland for the first time on record

We need to raise awareness and we need to create a mass mobilization of people from all over the world.

The 10 countries most at risk were all in Africa, with the Central African Republic, Chad and Nigeria most vulnerable. The index identified 33 countries as extremely high risk, and found a ""disconnect"" between where most greenhouse gases were being emitted and where children were at the greatest risk of the most significant impacts. ""Climate change is deeply inequitable. While no child is responsible for rising global temperatures, they will pay the highest costs. The children from countries least responsible will suffer most of all,"" UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a statement. The 33 extremely high-risk countries collectively emit just 9% of global carbon dioxide (CO2), while the 10 countries that emitted the most accounted for nearly 70% of CO2 emissions, the report said. India was the only country that both recorded high CO2 emissions and was extremely high risk. While it is responsible for more than 7% of global CO2 emissions, it has a large population of more than 1.3 billion people, and its per capita emissions are only 1.8 metric tons. Children in Iceland, Luxembourg and New Zealand were least at risk. Those countries have small populations, but, per capita, Iceland and New Zealand emit more than 6 metric tons of the world's emissions, while in Luxembourg, it's more than 15 - on par with Americans, Canadians, Saudis and Australians. Zimbabwean climate activist Nkosilathi Nyathi said in the video that climate change was ""very personal"" to him, and that people in his village, especially farmers, were struggling with unpredictable weather. ""If the weather continues like this, it could lead to a serious crisis in my community. Young people are the world's most precious natural resource.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/19/business/norway-oil-field-climate-change-intl/index.html,"CNN It's not a boast you usually hear about an oil field: Norway says its huge new facility is great for the environment. The oil-rich nation claims the Johan Sverdrup field, which was opened with pomp by the Prime Minister last week, is helping to ""reduce emissions"" because it is completely powered by renewable energy. ""Johan Sverdrup is now open. That's good news for our investors, for Norway - and for emissions,"" boasts the official website of Its critics, however, see Norway's third-biggest oil field ever as a perfect symbol of the Scandinavian country's climate hypocrisy. The field, located around 87 miles off the Norwegian coast, is named after the country's first prime minister. It has reserves of 2.7 billion barrels of oil, enough to last half a century and bring more than The operation is powered by energy brought from the shore, generated mainly from hydroelectric power - a rarity for offshore oil fields, most of which are powered by diesel generators. It is a fitting example of Yet Norway is also a ""Norway has a schizophrenic relationship with climate and oil and gas,"" Lars-Henrik Paarup Michelsen, CEO of the Norwegian Climate Foundation think tank, told CNN. ""We are great at adopting ambitious emission targets, but at the same time we plan for oil and gas production for decades to come."" On top of its significant fossil fuel reserves, Norway also has abundant renewable energy resources, particularly in hydropower. It covers its domestic needs with clean energy and sells most of its oil and gas abroad.  But Paarup Michelsen said this saving is not significant when considering the bigger picture, because emissions from production account for only 5% of total emissions from the global oil industry. ""The big problem is the combustion, in sectors like transport and industry,"" he said. As Mark van Baal, founder of climate pressure group Follow This, put it: ""An oil company with targets for its own emissions, and not for its products is like a cigarette producer that promises that all employees will quit smoking, while increasing cigarette production."" Who is responsible? The Norwegian government can claim it is doing all it can to For Norway, this means that it is not responsible for the emissions caused by the burning of its oil in other places around the world. According to figures from Norway's statistical office, the country's annual domestic greenhouse gas emissions reached around 53 million tons in 2017. That comes to roughly 10 tons per person, which is roughly in line with the rest of Europe. Emissions in the US stood at 15 tons per person in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency. The emissions generated by Norway's exports, however, are of a very different magnitude. According to the United Nations' Emission Gap Report, emissions from the oil and gas Norway sold abroad reached roughly 470 million tons in 2017. When the Norwegian government talks about reducing emissions, it means domestic emissions, not from its exports. But the Experts say that Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment Ola Elvestuen acknowledged that his country will need to change its ways in the future. ""The world needs to reduce its use of fossil fuel as fast as possible, and of course this will affect both the Norwegian economy and petroleum sector,"" he said in a statement emailed to CNN. Yet despite its climate commitments, Norway's government policy is also aimed at luring global oil giants to try to find and recover more oil in its territory. Under current laws, companies can deduct 78% of their exploration costs from their taxable income. The strategy is working. According to the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, activity in the oil and gas industry is rising rapidly. In 2019, Norway awarded 83 production licenses, a new record, and started 57 new exploration wells. The Norwegian government is not making any secret of the fact that it has long-term plans for the oil industry. The Johan Sverdrup field operation is scheduled to run until 2070 - 20 years after global emissions must be zero, according to a pledge signed by Norway's government. Elvestuen said that while the new field might be active for a long time, two-thirds of the resources there are projected to be recovered before 2030. After that, production is expected to decline. ""An expression often used by the largest parties in Norway is that the person who will 'switch the light off' on (oil production on) the Norwegian shelf has not yet been born,"" said Paarup Michelsen.",Norway says its new giant oil field is actually good for the environment.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/26/politics/trump-kavanaugh-gorsuch-barrett-supreme-court/index.html,"CNN The three appointees of former President  Whether their differences intensify or fade will determine the Trump effect on the high court and how fast the law moves rightward regarding abortion rights, gun control, religion and LGBTQ clashes.  Gorsuch appears most impatient for change and readiest to ignore the potential consequences of rulings, saying such concerns rest with Congress and others beyond the court. He is the boldest of the three new justices in urging reconsideration of legal milestones, including on abortion rights and Earlier this month, when the court hollowed out a section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act prohibiting race discrimination, Gorsuch went a step further, saying it was still an open question whether political parties, civil rights organizations and other private groups could bring lawsuits to enforce the VRA provision. Gorsuch also sets himself apart with hard-hitting rhetoric and derision of Kavanaugh, for his part, is more apt to highlight practical consequences of the court's rulings, minimize differences among fellow justices and offer appeasing asides, even as his vote deepens the ideological divide. Last session as he voted against a Kavanaugh seeks to display an understanding of litigants' plight despite rejecting their claims. This year, when he wrote the court's opinion against a Barrett has so far sidestepped internal skirmishes and kept a low profile. She opted to write far fewer opinions than her Trump predecessors in their comparable early months. Yet Barrett's single ""concurring"" opinion, in a conflict between religious rights and LGBTQ interests, offered a window into her go-slow approach. She said the court should wait to overturn a precedent covering government regulations that impinge the free exercise of religion until it had a workable substitute. More importantly, her appointment, succeeding the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, changed the outcome of challenges brought by religious believers to state Covid-19 restrictions. Barrett cast the key fifth vote in cases from churches and synagogues objecting to state Covid-19 precautions that limited in-person worship services. Overall, the three Trump appointees voted together with fellow conservatives (Roberts, Clarence Thomas and They curtailed the reach of the Voting Rights Act, threatened the ability of states to impose disclosure requirements on political donors and strengthened property rights in the face of government regulation. That last dispute, from California, arose from union organizers' efforts to temporarily enter agricultural property to talk to migrant farmworkers. But as the three went their individual ways, Gorsuch agreed more with far-right conservatives Thomas and Alito, while Kavanagh and Barrett aligned more with Roberts at the center-right of this nine-member bench. Overall in the recently completed session, Gorsuch agreed most with Thomas, 73% in full and 87% in part, according to Trump has touted his influence on the federal judiciary as one of his greatest achievements in office. That impact will swell as his appointees across the judiciary - especially on the high court - gain seniority and further shape the law with their opinions. Gorsuch's textualism and taunting Gorsuch, who joined the bench in April 2017, has the clearest record of the three. He is known for his textualist approach, which relies on the words of a statute rather than legislative history and other societal context. Gorsuch also has argued most vigorously for greater presidential authority and control over regulatory agencies. Now age 53, the Denver native split his youth between Colorado and Washington, where his mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from 1981 to 1983. Prolific with his opinions, Gorsuch has staked out positions for future cases, for example, urging reconsideration of abortion rights jurisprudence. (The justices recently agreed to take up a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.) In 2020, when the majority narrowly invalidated a Louisiana regulation on physicians who perform abortions, Gorsuch wrote, ""To arrive at today's result, rules must be brushed aside and shortcuts taken. ... (W)e have lost our way."" Gorsuch often rejects a focus on the practical consequences of a decision, saying the justices should leave the fallout to Congress. That was seen in a Since he joined the court, Gorsuch has tangled with Roberts on matters small and large, including how much to flex the court's new conservative muscle. When Roberts, a 2005 appointee of George W. Bush, seeks a fifth vote for a compromise at the center of the court, he is more likely to get it from Kavanaugh than Gorsuch. That was seen in last month's order keeping in place a Centers for Disease Control eviction moratorium because of the Covid pandemic. Gorsuch has a way of taunting Chief Justice Roberts into a response on cases. When Roberts wrote an opinion reviving a New Mexico woman's claim of excessive force against police, Gorsuch complained that he had opted to ""repurpose"" legal precedent because of ""new policing realities"" and ""to make life easier for ourselves."" Roberts countered that the majority's rationale was sound and, ""There is no call for such surmise."" Gorsuch faced off last session with Kavanaugh when Gorsuch wrote a majority opinion favoring an immigrant fighting deportation, based on the text of a statute. Dissenting, Kavanaugh said Gorsuch's reading of the disputed law would ""impose substantial costs and burdens on the immigration system."" Rejoined Gorsuch, ""[T]hat kind of raw consequentialist calculation plays no role in our decision."" Kavanaugh's dual tracks Kavanaugh, 56, grew up just outside of Washington, DC, in suburban Maryland. Favoring sports metaphors, he has said he aspires to be part of a ""team of nine."" In his opinions, the 2018 appointee who narrowly survived a brutal confirmation battle tries to accentuate where the justices agree, even as they divide into familiar 6-3 ideological patterns. He also has advocated incremental steps in high-profile cases. Last year, he wanted to send the Louisiana abortion dispute back to lower courts for additional fact-finding and avoid a larger abortion-rights decision. Kavanaugh has, however, consistently voted to pare down women's reproductive rights. Two criminal law decisions he authored in the recent term produced antagonistic exchanges with his liberal colleagues. His opinion enhancing the ability of states to lock up juvenile offenders for life without parole prompted Sonia Sotomayor to protest that he was mischaracterizing prior cases involving juveniles. (Earlier cases said life in prison should be given only rarely to offenders under age 18, those whose crimes reflect ""irreparable corruption."") She noted that Kavanaugh had written that his decision for the majority ""carefully follows"" those precedents, and she added ""The Court is fooling no one. ... I cannot countenance the Court's abandonment of"" two prior cases. Kavanagh responded, "" He took the lead for the court in a separate dispute over whether a 2020 decision forbidding non-unanimous juries in criminal cases was retroactive. By a 6-3, conservative-liberal, vote the majority said the new rule could not be invoked retroactively by defendants who had already exhausted their appeals. When Elena Kagan argued in dissent that the unanimity rule was such a watershed that it should be retroactive, Kavanaugh suggested she lacked grounds to criticize because she had dissented from the 2020 decision requiring juror unanimity. ""If the dissent's view had prevailed in (the 2020 case),"" he wrote, ""no defendant would ever be entitled to the jury-unanimity right - not on collateral review, not on direct review, and not in the future."" Kagan said she was following a court principle of respect for precedent in the new case and that Kavanaugh was wrongly considering cases in the aggregate, rather than individually. Kavanaugh, she said, took an approach that ""treats judging as scorekeeping."" He responded that he and the others in the majority had ""acted in good faith in deciding the difficult questions."" Barrett's first term In her early months on the bench, Barrett wrote less than colleagues and kept her cards close. The 49-year-old native of New Orleans took her seat in late October, missing the first 10 case arguments of the 2020-21 term. A former Notre Dame law professor, she lived in South Bend, Indiana, for nearly two decades before moving recently to the Washington area. In some respects, junior justices depend upon senior justices who assign opinions for the court majority and the primary dissent for their public writings. (Barrett ended up with four opinions for the court majority.) But any justice can break off and write separate concurring or dissenting opinions. Barrett did that only once in the cases that were argued before the justices last session. Her presence was especially consequential, however, as the court acted on emergency requests in pandemic-related disputes. She sided with religious adherents protesting Covid restrictions on churches and synagogues in New York and California. Her vote, the opposite of Ginsburg's in related disputes, meant that the religious objectors prevailed over the state officials. In one dispute from California, however, Barrett hedged. She signed the court's decision lifting capacity limits on indoor worship services, but she voted to keep in place a ban on singing. She said it was not clear whether the singing ban applied across the board. ""Of course, if a chorister can sing in a Hollywood studio but not in her church, California's regulations cannot be viewed as neutral,"" Barrett's most revealing separate opinion arose in a dispute between the City of Philadelphia and Catholic Social Services, which objected to a city non-discrimination policy that would have required the agency to screen gay couples to be foster parents. The Supreme Court ruled for Catholic Social Services but declined to reexamine a controversial 1990 precedent that had been at the heart of the controversy. That 1990 decision from an Oregon case, known as Gorsuch, along with Thomas and Alito, said it was time to abandon the rule that can disadvantage religious believers. Barrett agreed with some criticisms of the Smith decision but was at a loss for the legal standard to take its place. ""There would be a number of issues to work through if Smith were overruled,"" she wrote. ""To name a few: Should entities like Catholic Social Services - which is an arm of the Catholic Church - be treated differently than individuals? Should there be a distinction between indirect and direct burdens on religious exercise? What forms of scrutiny should apply? ... We need not wrestle with these questions in this case."" Gorsuch wanted the justices to reconsider the Smith case, and he chided Barrett for casting the effort as so daunting. ""We hardly need to 'wrestle' today with every conceivable question that might follow from recognizing Smith was wrong. ... (T)he Court should overrule it now, set us back on the correct course, and address each case as it comes.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/26/health/omicron-variant-what-we-know/index.html,"CNN A new and potentially more transmissible coronavirus variant The strain,  While scientists say there is reason to be concerned over Omicron, they stress there is still a lot we don't know - including whether the variant is indeed more contagious, whether it causes more severe disease or what its effects on vaccine efficacy may be. ""While this is concerning, as the WHO has indicated, I do think that we have to step back and wait for the science on this,"" epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed told CNN. It may take weeks to know if it causes more severe disease It will be a couple of weeks until more answers are clear, said Salim Abdool Karim, former co-chair of the South African Ministerial Advisory Committee on Covid-19. ""The reality is we've only known about this virus for just over a week, so we don't really have the kind of data required to answer those questions definitively,"" Karim said Monday when asked whether Omicron is more transmissible, more virulent and evades vaccines. People must be careful not to presume what the likely clinical picture will be based on what is being seen right now, he told John Berman on CNN's ""New Day."" There needs to be a much broader picture, as it's too early to see severe cases, which normally come a few weeks later, he said. US health officials should know in a week or two how severe that cases caused by the new variant will be, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday. Fauci said US health officials are getting their information from their counterparts in South Africa, with whom they've been in near constant contact. ""They have a number of patients that they're following in the medical facilities, and they assured us that they would know probably in a matter of a week, a week and a half, as to whether or not we're dealing with something that, for the most part is more severe, equally as severe or less severe. It could be either of them,"" Fauci said.  Health officials do not know yet whether the variant will cause more severe outcomes, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb noted Sunday to CBS News. ""Is this making people more ill? There's no indication that it is. And in fact, there's some anecdotal information offered from physicians in South Africa that this could be causing milder illness. Now, that could be an artifact of the fact that initial cases seem to be clustered in younger people, perhaps in outbreaks around universities,"" Gottlieb said. Early evidence suggests it transmits faster The Omicron variant was highly contagious in South Africa - but that doesn't mean the same thing will happen elsewhere, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told Jim Sciutto on Monday on CNN's ""Newsroom."" ""I think it is clear from what's happening in South Africa that this Omicron variant does spread rapidly,"" Collins said, noting that Covid-19 cases are relatively low in South Africa. ""What we don't know is whether this Omicron variant will outcompete Delta in a country like ours, or whether Delta, because it's been so successful, will basically just push it aside. That's another unknown."" Omicron has similar mutations to the Delta variant, Karim said, so there's an expectation that it will transmit more quickly. Based on early evidence in South Africa, ""it's certainly transmitting faster than the Delta variant."" There are no known cases of the Omicron variant in the United States so far, Fauci said Monday on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""It's inevitable that sooner or later it's going to spread widely because it has at least the molecular characteristics of being highly transmissible, even though there are a lot of things about it that we do not know but that will be able to be ascertained in the next week or two, I believe,"" Fauci said. The Omicron variant indeed is comparable to the Delta variant, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""We're seeing a variant that has the capability of high transmissibility, meaning that it's very readily transmitted, and that has been the variant that ultimately wins the kind of the king of the hill for the viruses, as Delta basically replaced Alpha, which replaced previous strains,"" Osterholm told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""It's very likely that we're going to see in the days ahead that the Omicron virus is going to ultimately be the new king of the hill, and in fact it will bring with it this ability to potentially impact on immune response,"" he said. A doctor says cases have been mild - so far A South African doctor says the Omicron cases she has handled so far have been mild. ""So it started with a younger generation of 40 and less, and the most predominant clinical complaint is severe fatigue for one or two days, with then the headache and the body aches and pain,"" Dr. Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of South African Medical Association, told Reuters. ""Some of them will have what they call a scratch throat, and some will have a cough, a dry cough. But it's not a constant cough. It comes and goes. And that's more or less the big symptoms that we have seen."" Coetzee, who was among the first in the country to suspect a new Covid-19 variant was making people sick, and her colleagues have not treated anyone requiring oxygen, she said. Some patients have had high temperatures, including one severely ill child with a fast pulse. The child was treated at home and was feeling better after about 48 hours, Coetzee said. ""I'm not saying the virus is not going to give you severe infections, but the whole hype out there doesn't make any sense, medical sense, at this stage,"" Coetzee told Reuters. She acknowledged the clinical picture of the virus could change. Vaccines are the best way to deal with it, expert says The best advice for dealing with the new variant is to get vaccinated and then get a booster shot, Collins said. ""Your best protection against Delta is to get vaccinated, and if you've already been vaccinated and six months have passed since you got Pfizer or Moderna, get your booster; two months since J&J, get your booster,"" he said. ""That was a reason already, but now add Omicron to the mix,"" Collins said. ""And we do believe that this new variant, which will probably come to our shores, will also be something vaccines and boosters can help you with. ""Get your vaccine, get your booster,"" he said. ""It's the best chance we've got to drive this Covid-19 pandemic away."" What vaccine makers are saying about it Moderna should know in the next couple of weeks how effective its vaccines are against the Omicron variant, its chief medical officer said Monday. ""If we need to manufacture an Omicron-specific variant, it's going to take some weeks, you know, two to three months is probably what we're looking at to be able to really begin to test it and manufacture it,"" Dr. Paul Burton told ""Good Morning America"" on Monday. ""We'll know from laboratory tests in the next couple of weeks just how effective the vaccines are against this variant."" Moderna is also testing an Omicron-specific booster, it said. ""For several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant,"" Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a news release. Omicron includes mutations ""seen in the Delta variant that are believed to increase transmissibility and mutations seen in the Beta and Delta variants that are believed to promote immune escape. The combination of mutations represents a significant potential risk to accelerate the waning of natural and vaccine-induced immunity,"" Moderna said Friday in a news release. If its current vaccine and booster are insufficient against the variant, one possible solution is boosting people with a larger dose, which Moderna said it is testing. The company is also evaluating two multivalent booster candidates to see whether they provide better protection against Omicron; both include some of the viral mutations present in the variant. AstraZeneca also is looking to understand the impact Omicron has on its vaccine, which is not currently authorized for use in the US, it said. ""AstraZeneca is also already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified, namely in Botswana and Eswatini, that will enable us to collect real world data of Vaxzevria against this new virus variant,"" a spokesperson for the company said Friday. The company also is testing its antibody treatment, AZD7442, against the variant, it said. AstraZeneca asked the US Food and Drug Administration in October to authorize emergency use of the treatment. Scientists at BioNTech, the German company that partnered with Pfizer to make its Covid-19 vaccine, are also investigating the impact of the variant on their shot, with data expected within the next couple of weeks. Johnson & Johnson also is testing the effectiveness of its vaccine against Omicron, its spokesperson told CNN in a statement. Its mutations are raising concern Omicron has an unusually high number of mutations, with more than 30 in the Scientists are concerned the mutations could make the variant more transmissible and could result in immune evasion. Scientists are working to find out whether the variant could evade immunity, saying its mutations can help hint or predict whether it will be the case, Fauci told CNN on Friday. ""What you need to do is, you need to get that particular sequence of the virus, put it in a form in the lab where you can actually test the different antibodies, so you can have a prediction that it might evade, or you can actually prove it,"" he said. ""Right now, you're talking about sort of like a red flag that this might be an issue, but we don't know,"" Fauci added. ""Once you test it, you'll know for sure whether or not it does or does not evade the antibodies that we make, for example, against the virus through a vaccine or ... after you get infected."" The dean of the Brown University School of Public Health does not believe the variant will create a situation where ""vaccines will be rendered useless,"" he said. ""I think that's exceedingly unlikely,"" Dr. Ashish Jha said. ""The question is, is there a tiny hit to vaccine efficacy, or is there a large hit? I think we'll get some preliminary data probably in the next few days."" How it compares with other variants While mutations - and new variants - of the virus are expected as it continues to spread, experts say there's more reason for concern with Omicron. ""We have seen a lot of variants pop up over the last five, six months, and most of them have not amounted to much. This looks different,"" said Jha. ""It's acting differently, it looks like it's much more contagious than even the Delta variant."" The When experts looked at other variants, Jha said, it usually took several months for those strains to become dominant - in other words, the most common strain of the virus spreading in one area. ""This one has become dominant very quickly in South Africa in the regions where it's been found. Within a matter of days to weeks as opposed to months,"" Jha said. ""Now, the number of cases in South Africa is quite low, so it can be for other reasons as well, not just because it's more transmissible but the speed with which it has taken off is really unlike anything we've seen before."" Preliminary evidence suggests Omicron also poses a higher risk of reinfection, compared to other variants of concern, WHO officials said Friday in their statement.",What we know and don't know about the Omicron variant

That was until this year, when a single confirmed case sent the park, and its adjacent shopping district, Disneytown, into a snap lockdown Sunday evening. The extreme measure saw tens of thousands of visitors and staff forced to undergo coronavirus testing before they were allowed to leave the park, as police blocked the exits and secured the grounds. In a video that's since gone viral on Chinese social media, crowds are shown lining up in front of makeshift testing sites, as health workers in full personal protective equipment (PPE) watch on. In the background colorful fireworks light up the night sky above a storybook castle. The surreal juxtaposition of an impromptu mass testing drive and a Disney fireworks show is the latest example of how China's stringent zero-Covid policy has permeated every corner of Chinese citizens' lives. As countries around the world In its public statement, Shanghai Disney did not offer detailed reasons for the shutdown, only saying it was to ""cooperate with the pandemic investigation in other provinces and cities."" But a local health commission in the neighboring province of Jiangsu said a woman who visited Shanghai Disney on Saturday tested positive for Covid-19. The woman had taken a train to Shanghai from Jiangxi province on Friday. During her return trip the next day, she was found to be a close contact of a confirmed case in Jiangxi and taken off the train for quarantine. She tested positive on Sunday and had a fever, and was diagnosed as a confirmed case, according to the municipal government of Hangzhou, where the woman alighted. As of Monday morning, 33,863 people who were at Shanghai Disneyland and Disneytown over the weekend had been tested, and all results came back negative, according to the Shanghai government. But state media said about 100,000 people had visited the park at the weekend, citing sources. Both Disneyland and Disneytown will remain closed on Monday and Tuesday ""in order to follow the requirement of Covid-19 prevention and control,"" the resort said in the statement. The subway station connected to Disney has also been closed until further notice. While the park's shutdown over a single case would likely be considered extreme by most people outside of China, many Chinese internet users have praised the Shanghai government and Disney for what they see as a lenient, targeted and effective response. The tests were well organized and conducted swiftly, and visitors were allowed to return home or to their hotels, instead of being taken into centralized quarantine. They are required to self-isolate and undergo another Covid test 24 hours after leaving the park. If that test is also negative, visitors will be asked to observe 12 days of health-monitoring and take more tests - but they won't be confined to their homes or hotel rooms. The requirements are actually quite mild when compared to some of the more stringent measures taken by other local authorities, as they rush to contain a Over the past two weeks, the country has recorded more than 300 confirmed cases in 14 provinces and regions, with health officials Last week, two high-speed trains heading to Beijing were stopped midway through their journeys, when two crew members were found to be close contacts of confirmed cases. Hundreds of passengers on board were taken away for centralized quarantine. In Jiangxi province, a county turned all traffic lights to red to discourage traffic after a single case was reported on Saturday. Drivers who run the red light will be punished according to traffic rules, the county's traffic police said in a statement Saturday. The mandate was withdrawn on Sunday after sparking an outcry online. In Inner Mongolia's Ejin Banner, nearly 10,000 tourists were trapped after the city imposed a lockdown over dozens of cases last month.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/15/china/china-covid-outbreak-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Tens of millions of people are This outbreak has spread far faster than previous waves of less infectious variants, with daily cases skyrocketing from a few dozen in February to more than 5,100 on Tuesday - the highest figure since the early 2020 outbreak in Wuhan. The number may sound low compared to other countries, but it is alarmingly high for a nation that has attempted to stamp out outbreaks and chains of transmission with a strict zero-Covid policy throughout the pandemic. As of Tuesday, cases have been reported in 21 provinces and municipalities nationwide, including the national capital Beijing, and other major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen. The cases may still be in their thousands, but as of Tuesday 37 million people were in lockdown. Here's what we know about China's outbreak. How did this wave begin? Cases began rising at the start of the month in a few provinces around the country, including Shandong in the east, Guangdong in the south, and Jilin in the northeast. By March 6, experts were cautioning the situation was ""severe"" in some places - but they expressed confidence that ""China still has the ability to control it,"" state-run tabloid Jilin province, which shares a border with North Korea, soon became a major hotspot with a university cluster that prompted public outrage online after More than 4,000 of Tuesday's reported infections were reported in Jilin. Nearly half of the total infections in this outbreak have come from that province Authorities and state media say it's still not clear how the first few outbreaks began. But several What variant is spreading? Omicron has been driving this surge. One of the reasons cases have spread so fast and are harder to trace is Omicron's milder symptoms and shorter incubation time, The highly infectious variant has now replaced Delta as the dominant strain in the country, making up about 80% of recent cases, He added that experts are seeing both BA.1 - the original Omicron - and BA.2 is about 30% more transmissible than BA.1, according to early studies from the UK and Denmark. It is now causing about 1 in 5 Covid-19 cases worldwide, with cases detected in dozens of countries including the US, according to the World Health Organization. It's not yet clear whether it causes more severe disease, but some studies suggest it won't likely lead to greater numbers of hospitalizations and deaths, partly because it emerged so soon after the original Omicron wave, so many people have protective antibodies, either from recent infection or booster shots. What lockdowns and restrictions are in place? Five cities - collectively home to more than 37 million residents - are now under varying levels of lockdown. Residents in Changchun, Jilin city, Shenzhen and Dongguan are banned from leaving their neighborhoods, except for essential workers and emergency services. Each household is only allowed to send one person to buy groceries every two to three days. The fifth city, Langfang, went a step further in prohibiting all residents from leaving their homes except for emergency reasons. Several of these cities have suspended public transport and indoor dining, Jilin province has also implemented travel restrictions, prohibiting residents from leaving the province or traveling between cities within the province. But these lockdowns also pose a huge logistical challenge for the government, with CCTV reporting the province only has a few days' worth of medical supplies in stock. Authorities are now racing to boost health care capacity in hard-hit areas - for instance, building temporary treatment centers in Changchun and Jilin city, and deploying thousands of soldiers to help Covid control work, according to Global Times. Will China stick to zero-Covid? As increasingly infectious variants - Delta, then Omicron - spread in 2021, many countries abandoned the strict zero-Covid approach in favor of living with the virus. China and its territories, including Though some Chinese leaders and scientists have hinted that China could eventually move away from the strategy, that likely won't come anytime soon, if current rhetoric about bringing cases back to zero is any indication.

Last year the country imported $306 billion worth of chips, or 15% of the value of the country's total imports, according to government statistics. Beijing has pledged to improve its chipmaking technology and match the industry's most advanced leaders by 2030. Through its Made in China 2025 initiative, the country is trying to compete with the United States Analysts say that SMIC still has a long way to go to be a global competitor, though. ""SMIC currently lags behind TSMC in technology by about five years, and we believe the gap will persist over the next five years,"" Citi analysts wrote in a research report last month. TSMC and Samsung, for example, have the ability to produce tiny chipsets that can pack more technology into a smaller space, analysts from Jefferies wrote in a recent research note. In its prospectus, SMIC admitted that it has to narrow the gap with global leaders, adding that it has to spend more on research and development to do so. Huawei sanction risks The Chinese chipmaker also faces risks as US-China tensions escalate, spilling over into everything from national security and trade to technology. SMIC uses American-made software and equipment to create its chips, which it then supplies to other companies -- including embattled Chinese tech firm Huawei. But in May, the US Commerce Department announced a rule restricting companies from exporting computer chipsets and other key components to Huawei if those firms use American equipment to make them. ""SMIC will definitely be required by the new US rule to obtain an export license from the US before being able to make any ... chipsets for Huawei,"" according to the Jefferies analysts. ""It would, in our view, be unimaginable for SMIC not to comply with the new rule as it would risk being cut off from further supplies of US semi equipment and access to US software."" The chipmaker warned in its prospectus that the US tech restrictions could create obstacles preventing it from providing products and services to its clients, though it did not mention any names. Trade frictions and diplomatic disputes between China and other countries could also affect the company's overseas supply of raw materials and equipment, SMIC added.

Evergrande's stock plunged nearly 12% Friday in Hong Kong, reversing a recovery it staged the previous day on news that the company would pay interest on another bond issued in yuan to mainland Filling the vacuum of information is mounting speculation that the Chinese government will have to Beijing has few good choices. It will want to protect thousands of Chinese people who have bought unfinished apartments, construction workers, suppliers and small investors, as well as limiting the risk of other real estate firms going under. At the same time, it has been trying for at least a year to rein in excessive borrowing by developers and won't want to dilute that message. Speculation about one option -- an effective nationalization of the company -- was stoked Thursday after a regional financial news website, Citing anonymous sources close to the Chinese government, it said the plan would see Evergrande broken up into three separate entities, and the restructuring could be announced within days. Neither Evergrande nor China's top regulator for SOEs But analysts are already weighing up the possibility of Evergrande being nationalized. ""Most likely the government has to [inject capital into] Evergrande so that it can continue construction and then sell residential property units to get cash to repay debts,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China for ING. ""With government capital, it is likely that Evergrande could become [a] SOE or become part of the SOEs that could inject capital in Evergrande, "" she added. Good news in the short term? That would be good news for Evergrande, financial markets and the economy in the near term. The company is buckling under the weight of about $300 billion in total liabilities, and some analysts fear a disorderly collapse could spark China's ""Lehman Bros"" moment by sending shocks through the financial system and economy. Real estate and related industries account for about 30% of Chinese GDP. For Evergrande, becoming a SOE would help it restore confidence among home buyers, said Stephen Cheung and Calvin Leung, equity analysts for Jefferies in The move would also ""alleviate near-term liquidity pressure"" for the company, while making it easier to carry out a debt restructuring with domestic and overseas bondholders, they said. Moreover, it would give the Chinese government even greater control over the vast property market. Six of the country's top 10 property developers are SOEs or backed by state investors. Evergrande would become the seventh. 'End of the beginning?'

Demand for housing is easing for a number of reasons. The It means ""developers will be competing over a shrinking pie,"" Evans-Pritchard said. ""The environment for developers will get a lot more challenging. Evergrande's collapse marks the end of the beginning of the squeeze facing China's property sector rather than the beginning of the end,"" Taking control of Evergrande would also fit a recent pattern of greater intervention in the Chinese economy. Beijing has been Pang from ING believes the government's crackdown on property and other industries could harm the economy. ""Recent government policies do not aim to squeeze companies into debt troubles. But I agree that there are too many policies coming out in a short period of time.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - which the Gulf Stream is a major part of - helps maintain the energy balance in the Atlantic Ocean. It is often described as a ""conveyor belt"" that takes warm surface water from the tropics and distributes it to the north Atlantic. The colder, saltier water then sinks and flows south. A study, Scientists have Global weather patterns are critically linked to the circulation and its transport of heat and nutrients around the planet. A collapse of this system would result in significant and abrupt changes, including fast sea level rise, more extreme winters in Western Europe and disruptions to monsoon systems in the tropics. It could also have a cascading effect and destabilize other components of the Earth's climate system, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the Amazon rainforest. This scenario was the premise for the 2004 climate science fiction film ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" in which a series of extreme weather disasters strike after climate change caused the AMOC to collapse. The circulation is weaker than it has been in around 1,000 years, scientists had previously said, but they did not know whether it had actually been destabilized or undergoing natural changes. This week's study used eight datasets looking at surface temperatures and salinity in the North Atlantic over a period of 150 years, and found global warming was driving the destabilization. ""The difference is crucial,"" the study's author, Niklas Boers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told CNN in an email. ""Imagine a chair, which can be either shifted (with all four legs remaining on the ground) or tilted. Both change the position of the chair (corresponding to the change in mean AMOC strength), but in the first case the stability of the chair won't be affected, while in the latter case there exists a critical point. If we tilt the chair just slightly further, it will fall down. My results suggest that what is happening to the AMOC is more likely to be a tilting than only a shifting, so the AMOC has moved toward the critical threshold at which it may collapse,"" he said. Boers added that he himself was surprised by his findings that the AMOC had been destabilized and was ""moving toward its critical threshold, at which it could abruptly collapse."" A collapse of the circulation would mean significant cooling in Europe, Beors said, ""but maybe more concerning is the effect of an AMOC collapse on the tropical monsoon systems of South America, Western Africa, and India; especially in Western Africa, an AMOC collapse could lead to permanent drought conditions."" Boers recognizes in his study that he and other scientists still don't know if and when the current might collapse, but he called on the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ""as much and as quickly as possible."" ""Every gram of extra greenhouse gas in the atmosphere will increase to the probability of an AMOC collapse in the future, so emitting as little as possible, both on individual but of course also on collective and international level, is the key.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/14/politics/us-china-russia-ukraine/index.html,"CNN The US has information suggesting China It is not yet clear whether China intends to provide Russia with that assistance, US officials familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. But during an intense, seven-hour meeting in Rome, a top aide to President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart of ""potential implications and consequences"" for China should support for Russia be forthcoming, a senior administration official said. The series of events underscored the growing concern among American officials at the budding partnership between Moscow and Beijing as Biden works to isolate and punish Russia for its aggression in Ukraine. While officials have said the Chinese President was alarmed at what has taken place since Russia invaded, there is little to indicate China is prepared to cut off its support entirely. That leaves open a troubling possibility for American officials - that China may help prolong a bloody conflict that is increasingly killing civilians, while also cementing an authoritarian alliance in direct competition with the United States. In a diplomatic cable, the US relayed to its allies in Europe and Asia that China had conveyed a willingness to assist Russia, which has asked for military support. The cable did not state definitively that assistance had been provided. One official also said the US warned in the cable that China would likely deny it was willing to provide assistance. Among the assistance Russia requested was pre-packaged, non-perishable military food kits, known in the US as ""meal, ready-to-eat,"" or MREs, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The request underscores the basic logistical challenges that military analysts and officials say have stymied Russian progress in Ukraine - and raises questions about the fundamental readiness of the Russian military. Forward-deployed units have routinely outstripped their supply convoys and open source reports have shown Russian troops breaking into grocery stores in search of food as the invasion has progressed. One of the sources suggested that food might be a request that China would be willing to meet, because it stops short of lethal assistance that would be seen as deeply provocative by the west. The Chinese Communist Party leadership is not all in agreement regarding how to respond to Russia's request for assistance, said one of the sources. Two officials said that China's desire to avoid economic consequences may limit its appetite to help Russia. Officials separately told CNN that Chinese President ""There is real concern by some that their involvement could hurt economic relationships with the West, on which China relies,"" said one of the sources. Officials are also monitoring whether China provides some economic and In Rome, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan and a US delegation who met with top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi ""raised directly and very clearly"" concerns about Chinese ""support to Russia in the wake of the invasion, and the implications that any such support would have for"" China's relationship with the US and partners around the world, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. ""That includes allies and partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific,"" Price said at a State Department briefing Monday. Concerns over China's potential involvement in the war came as bombardments intensified in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and Russia's military Ukrainian forces have ""effectively struck Russian logistics and sustainment capabilities"" in the war, a senior US defense official told reporters on Monday. And the US does not believe Russia's missile strikes on a Ukrainian military training center in western Ukraine will affect American efforts to provide weapons shipments to that country's military. Biden, who is working to rally international support for Ukraine, US watching how China responds to Russian invasion of Ukraine Heading into the meeting, US officials said they expected Yang to portray China as a neutral partner willing to help facilitate talks between the two sides aimed at bringing an end to hostilities. China has ramped The US has viewed those efforts somewhat skeptically, given China's recent closeness with Russia. And over the weekend, US officials said they had information that Russia had asked China for military support, including drones, as its invasion advances more slowly than the Kremlin had expected. Both the Chinese and Russian governments publicly denied that the request had been made. Sullivan told CNN on Sunday that China providing Russia with support is a ""concern."" ""We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support, material support or economic support, to Russia. It is a concern of ours. And we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions,"" Sullivan said. American officials say they believe Xi has been unsettled by Russia's invasion and the performance of Russia's military, which has experienced logistical and strategic setbacks since the invasion began more than two weeks ago. Watching from Beijing, Xi was caught off-guard that his own intelligence had not been able to predict what happened, even though the United States had been warning of an invasion for weeks, the officials said. ""They may not have understood the full extent of it,"" Sullivan said on CNN on Sunday, ""because it's very possible that Putin lied to them, the same way that he lied to Europeans and others."" The mostly global repudiation of Russia's actions has caused China to weigh what damage it may suffer to its reputation by sticking with Russian President Vladimir Putin. And an economic rupture with Europe or the United States could damage a Chinese economy already growing more slowly than it has in 30 years. For all those reasons, American officials believe now is a moment when engaging with China is an imperative as it determines how to proceed amid Russia's aggression. US and Chinese officials have been in regular touch over the past several weeks, including in the lead-up to Russia's invasion. Price said the US is ""watching very closely the extent to which the PRC"" - another name for China - ""or any other country, for that matter, provides any form of support, whether that's material support, whether that's economic support, whether that's financial support to Russia."" ""Any such support from anywhere in the world would be of great concern to us,"" he said. He declined to comment specifically on reports about the diplomatic cable. ""We have communicated very clearly to Beijing that we won't stand by. ... We will not allow each country to compensate Russia for its losses,"" he added. Price characterized the Chinese response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine as somewhat ""ambivalent."" ""I read a statement the other day from a PRC official calling the situation complicated. There's nothing complicated about this. This is naked aggression,"" he said. Russian invasion of Ukraine tosses its relationship with China into tumult Sullivan's meeting Monday in Rome was originally meant as a follow-up to US President Joe Biden and Xi's nearly three-hour virtual summit in November, which occurred at the same time American officials began warning of a massive buildup of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders. On that call, Xi warned Biden that dividing the world into competing blocs would ""inevitably bring disaster,"" according to a Chinese readout. Yet Russia's invasion has done more to align the world in competing alliances than anything Biden had done with the aim of bolstering American relationships - an outcome American intelligence has found Xi was also unprepared for, believing instead that European economic interests would prevent countries there from imposing severe sanctions. That dynamic has complicated a relationship that Xi and Putin declared had ""no limits"" in a lengthy document in February, when Putin visited Beijing for talks and to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. The US decision to stage a diplomatic boycott of the Games infuriated Xi, officials have said, making Putin's presence in the stadium even more important. The evolving response in China to the Russian invasion - from denying one would happen to avoiding public condemnation to presenting itself as a possible mediator - has been closely monitored by the White House, where the potential of a Moscow-Beijing alliance is viewed with heightened concern. CIA Director Bill Burns said last week the partnership was rooted in ""a lot of very cold-blooded reasons."" A new ""axis"" forming in opposition to American-led efforts at bolstering regional security has been in the works since before the war in Ukraine, including in the economic, political and military sectors. But the US does not view the partnership as fully developed, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers last week. ""We do see it as not yet at the point where we are, for example, with allies,"" Haines said. ""They have not achieved that kind of level of cooperation, and we anticipate it is unlikely in the next five years that they will ... become the way we are an ally with our other NATO members in that context.""

The US e-commerce giant is partnering with Future Retail, which has more than 1,500 stores across 400 Indian cities, the companies Future Retail will also allow customers to pick up products they order on Amazon from its stores. ""This arrangement will allow us to build upon each other's strengths in the physical and digital space,"" Future Retail chairman Kishore Biyani said in a statement.

Millions of Indian shoppers are still wary of venturing into physical stores, and Meena expects online sales to grow more than 34% to $6.5 billion this year. ""This is the time when consumers are actually in spending mode,"" he said, adding that the roughly one-month sales Flipkart's competitive edge during the festive season Flipkart was India's single-largest online retailer in 2018 with 31.9% market share, according to the most recent report from Forrester. Walmart bought the homegrown company Flipkart's seasonal shopping event, Big Billion Days, kicked off on Friday. The company has built its strategy around selling affordable goods to the huge number of middle and lower middle class online shoppers in India's smaller cities, according to ""A significant ... number of people in India look for value for money,"" Kumar said. ""If you provide the right value and the right customer experience, you will win."" But Amazon Last year, the US firm was ranked as India's most trusted online retailer in an annual survey conducted by TRA. The market research firm reported that 10 times as many respondents said they trusted Amazon than they did Flipkart, which came second. ""Flipkart and Amazon are neck-to-neck in the e-commerce wars, in terms of their product offerings, their initiatives to bolster affordability and increase consumer confidence, and most importantly, their last-mile delivery initiatives,"" said Prabhu Ram, head of the Industry Intelligence Group at research firm CMR. Forrester's Meena agreed, noting that ""no clear winner"" has yet emerged. But he added that when it comes to festive sales, Flipkart has ""an edge in terms of the amount of money customers spend."" That's because Flipkart dominates online fashion sales, The importance of Diwali Flipkart and Amazon each Since then, they have worked to improve their supply chains -- especially ahead of the festive season. Amazon opened a new warehouse in Bangalore this month to handle the spike in holiday orders and hired 100,000 seasonal workers -- 10,000 more than last year. Flipkart said it hired 70,000 additional warehouse and delivery workers to handle the rush, a 20,000-person increase over 2019. Both companies have also translated their platforms into more languages, which they say will help ""We have geared up really strongly for the festive season,"" said Minari Shah, director of public relations at Amazon India. Amazon's Great Indian Festival starts on Saturday, but members of its Prime subscription program have access to deals a day earlier. Like Flipkart, Amazon declined to talk about past or projected festive sales figures, but Shah noted that ""undoubtedly, [the holiday season is] a very important part of our calendar."" Like the US retail events Black Friday and Cyber Monday, India's online shoppers are loading up virtual carts ahead of time as they wait for sales to kick in. Retailers typically offer deals on fashion, smartphones and consumer electronics, as well as holiday staples like candles, lights and other decorations. ""Since I need to buy a couple of gadgets, I feel that I can wait for a couple of weeks until the sale starts and get a better deal,"" said Anshul Arzare, a banker who lives in Mumbai. Arzare said he has seen a spike in online shopping since the pandemic started. In his apartment complex, ""there's a designated area for delivery boys, and at any given time you can see an Amazon boy there with 20 packages."" The professional said he prefers using Amazon. ""The experience has been quite good and I intrinsically have more confidence in Amazon's product delivery rather than Flipkart,"" he said. Jio is not a major threat, for now The festive sales battle is taking place as Asia's richest man makes a play for the country's growing e-commerce market. JioMart, which is part of Mukesh Ambani's sprawling conglomerate Reliance Industries, made waves earlier this year JioMart is part of Jio Platforms, which has raked in more than $20 billion in funding from the likes of Facebook ""Though it is fairly nascent, JioMart is ambitious, and with a cocktail of attractive discounts and cashback offers, will seek to entice online shoppers,"" said Ram, of CMR. JioMart did not respond to a request for comment for this story. For now, it is only offering online groceries, leaving Flipkart and Amazon to duke it out over deals on smartphones, consumer electronics, clothing and households items. But JioMart plans to enter the fray soon. ""In addition to grocery, we will expand JioMart to cover electronics, fashion, pharmaceutical and healthcare in the days ahead,"" Ambani said at Reliance Industries' annual meeting in July. Flipkart said it welcomes more competition. Growing India's e-commerce industry ""requires so much investment on the ground to build supply chain,"" Kumar said. ""More players are good because more and more investment will come to build that supply chain."" Whether it is Flipkart, JioMart or some other e-commerce player, Shah said Amazon tries not to get caught up in what rivals are up to. ""We watch them, but we are always more focused and obsessed with our customers than with the competition,"" she said. The competition will only intensify. E-commerce sales account for just 5% of India's total gross merchandise value, according to an August report from consulting firm McKinsey. But now, because of the pandemic, ""the digital economy in India is in the throes of taking off,"" said Ram, adding that companies are also picking up new consumers as rural parts of the country come online.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/nuland-sfrc-us-russia-ukraine/index.html,"CNN Russian President Vladimir Putin has built military capacity on the border of Ukraine that is ""much larger and on a much Moscow has positioned approximately 100 tactical groups and nearly all its ready ground forces based west of the Urals at different spots along its border with Ukraine, Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Much of this comes right out of Putin's 2014 playbook,"" Nuland said, ""but this time, it is much larger and on a much more lethal scale."" Speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead"" after her Senate appearance, Nuland also said Russia now has forces on three sides of Ukraine, ""which is not a scenario we've seen before."" Nuland, in that appearance later Tuesday, said Russia might use Belarus to invade Ukraine and perhaps ""mask"" its forces to look like Belarusian troops, a point she had emphasized in the Senate hearing as well. ""What we have not yet seen, but which we could see, are Russian forces coming down toward Ukraine from Belarus or, as I said today, masking as fellow Belarusian forces,"" Nuland told Tapper. ""We've seen the increasing dependence that Belarusian President (Alexander) Lukashanko has on Putin, so Putin could demand that he return the favor."" In the Senate hearing, Nuland told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, that ""it was particularly concerning to see President Lukashenko make a change in his own posture with regard to Crimea. He had long declined to recognize Russia's claim on Crimea, but he changed tack a week ago, which is concerning."" Nuland said that if Putin does take military action against Ukraine, the response from the US and allies won't resemble their reaction after Russia's invasion of Crimea. This time, the US and its allies will respond differently to any military action against Ukraine, Nuland said. While she declined to offer specific examples in an open hearing, she said the US and European allies ""will be united in imposing severe consequences on Moscow for its actions, including high impact economic measures that we have refrained from using in the past."" 'Extremely significant' Unlike the sanctions pursued in 2014, which escalated somewhat gradually, ""this time the intent is to make clear that the initial sanctions in response to any further aggressive moves in Ukraine will be extremely significant and isolating for Russia and for Russian business and for the Russian people."" She added that ""none of us seeks confrontation or crisis. Certainly, the Russian people don't need it."" Nuland testified hours after President Joe Biden The two-hour call was just the latest diplomatic outreach meant to avoid war on European soil. After a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Thursday in Stockholm, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters that the US and European allies are ""deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine, including efforts to destabilize Ukraine from within and large-scale military operations."" Nuland said diplomatic outreach to Ukrainian officials is ""ongoing at every level"" and that Defense Department officials are having ""pretty fulsome"" conversations with their Ukrainian counterparts. Biden is set to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later Tuesday or Wednesday, she said, following a call Blinken made to Zelensky on Monday after his meeting with Ukraine's foreign minister in Stockholm. ""We've had the defense minister, the foreign minister, the national security adviser in Washington,"" Nuland noted. ""And we have a very robust team in the embassy and our advisers in Kiev now."" A CIA Director Bill Burns said Monday that with those pieces in place, Putin is able to act swiftly. ""We don't know that Putin has made up his mind to use force, but what we do know is that he's putting the Russian military, the Russian security forces in a place where they could act in a pretty sweeping way,"" Burns told the Wall Street Journal CEO Summit. Planting the seeds Nuland said that Putin is planting seeds of disinformation within Russia, using claims that the country is under threat from Ukraine to ""prepare the ground in his own body politic."" She emphasized the need for US officials to convey to the Russian people what's at stake. ""I think it's important that not just President Putin, as he got the message very clearly from President Biden today, but that the Russian people also appreciate the kinds of things that are being contemplated and the kind of risk that their President is potentially taking them into, including for their sons and daughters who serve,"" Nuland said. The undersecretary and senators of both parties also warned that the Russian leader may be underestimating changes that have taken place in Ukraine since 2014. ""If Putin invades Ukraine, the implications will be devastating for the Russian economy, but also for the Russian people,"" said Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat. ""Ukrainian military forces of 2021 are not the Ukrainian military forces of 2014. They are well equipped thanks to the United States and our allies. They are well trained. They have years of combat experience and most importantly, they have every incentive to fight."" Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, later offered his own assessment. ""Russian blood will be spilled and there will be Russians going home in body bags if (Putin) invades this country,"" he said.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said there is a ""high to very high"" risk the new variant will spread in Europe. WHO's Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE), an independent group of experts, met Friday to discuss the variant, a WHO statement said. The advisers recommended WHO designate the variant as ""of concern,"" referencing the variant's large number of mutations, the possibility of increased risk of reinfection and other evidence. A number of studies are underway, and WHO will update member states and the public as needed, the WHO statement said. WHO called on countries to enhance their surveillance and sequencing efforts to better understand coronavirus variants. ""Initially it looked like some cluster outbreaks, but from yesterday, the indication came from our scientists from the Network of Genomic Surveillance that they were observing a new variant,"" Joe Phaahla, South Africa's Minister of Health, said Thursday, stressing it is currently unclear where the variant first emerged. South African officials initially said there was one confirmed case in a traveler from South Africa to Hong Kong. Then Hong Kong health authorities on Friday identified a second case of the B.1.1.529 variant among returning travelers on the same floor of a designated quarantine hotel. Also on Friday, the Belgian government said one individual who had recently arrived from abroad, and was not vaccinated, had tested positive for the new variant, marking the first case in Europe. Tulio de Oliveira, the director of South Africa's Center for Epidemic Response and Innovation, said the variant has ""many more mutations than we have expected,"" adding it is ""spreading very fast, and we expect to see pressure in the health system in the next few days and weeks."" Viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, mutate regularly and most new mutations do not have significant impact on the virus's behavior and the illness they cause. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, told CNN the variant was ""acting differently,"" however, and it ""looks like it's much more contagious than even the Delta variant."" A number of countries, Acting on advice from US health officials, US President Joe Biden will restrict travel from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi, administration officials told CNN. This does not apply to American citizens and lawful permanent residents. As with all international travelers, they must still test negative prior to travel. What we know about the new variant Lawrence Young, a virologist and a professor of molecular oncology at Warwick Medical School in the United Kingdom, said the Omicron variant was ""very worrying."" ""It is the most heavily mutated version of the virus we have seen to date. This variant carries some changes we've seen previously in other variants but never all together in one virus. It also has novel mutations,"" Young said in a statement.  Neil Ferguson, the director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said in a statement the number of mutations on the spike protein was ""unprecedented."" ""The spike protein gene [is] the protein which is the target of most vaccines. There is therefore a concern that this variant may have a greater potential to escape prior immunity than previous variants,"" Ferguson said. Sharon Peacock, a professor of Public Health and Microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said while the overall number of Covid-19 cases is relatively low in South Africa, there has been a rapid increase in the past seven days. She said while 273 new infections were recorded on November 16, the figure had risen to more than 1,200 cases by November 25, with more than 80% coming from Gauteng province. ""The epidemiological picture suggests that this variant may be more transmissible, and several mutations are consistent with enhanced transmissibility,"" Peacock said in a comment shared by the UK's Science Media Centre. She added while the significance of the mutations and their combination is unknown, some of those present in the latest variant have been associated in others with immune evasion. Jha, too, said scientists were concerned by the speed with which the Omicron variant has taken off. ""This one has become dominant very quickly in South Africa, in the regions where it's been found, within a matter of days to weeks as opposed to months,"" he told CNN. What we don't know Peacock, de Oliveira, Ferguson, Jha and other scientists said it was too early to tell the full impact of the mutations on vaccine efficacy. De Oliveira stressed the Covid-19 shots are still the best tool against the virus, adding lab studies still need to be carried out to test vaccine and antibody evasion. ""I don't think we're going to see a situation where the vaccines will be rendered useless,"" said Jha. ""I think that's exceedingly unlikely. The question is, is there a tiny hit to vaccine efficacy, or is there a large hit? I think we'll get some preliminary data probably in the next few days."" More studies also need to be conducted to understand the clinical severity of the variant compared to previous variants. It is also unclear where the new mutation emerged from. While it was first identified in South Africa, it may have come from elsewhere. ""It is important not to assume that the variant first emerged in South Africa,"" Peacock said. Vaccine maker Moderna said Friday the combination of mutations seen in the new Omicron variant represents a ""significant potential risk to accelerate the waning of natural and vaccine-induced immunity."" The company said it was working rapidly to test the ability of its vaccine to neutralize the new variant and data was expected in the coming weeks. AstraZeneca, another vaccine maker, said it was looking to understand the impact the Omicron variant has on its coronavirus vaccine, and was testing its antibody combination therapy against the new variant. The platform used in the vaccine enables the company to respond quickly to new variants, a spokesperson for the company said Friday. ""AstraZeneca is also already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified, namely in Botswana and Eswatini, that will enable us to collect real world data of Vaxzevria against this new virus variant,"" the spokesperson said. AstraZeneca's vaccine is not currently authorized for use in the US. Johnson & Johnson said it is testing its vaccine against the new variant. Quick reaction Scientists have praised South African health authorities for their quick reaction to a Covid-19 outbreak in the country's Gauteng province, which led to the discovery of the new variant. When cases in the province started to rise at a higher rate than elsewhere, health experts focused on sequencing samples from those who tested positive, which allowed them to quickly identify the B.1.1.529 variant. Peacock said the South African health ministry and its scientists ""are to be applauded in their response, their science, and in sounding the alarm to the world."" She added the development shows how important it is to have excellent sequencing capabilities and to share expertise with others. The reaction to the announcement of the new variant discovered by South African health authorities was also prompt. UK officials announced Thursday six African countries would be added to England's travel ""red list"" after the UK Health Security Agency flagged concern over the variant. UK's Health Minister Sajid Javid said flights to the UK from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe would be suspended from midday Friday and all six countries would be added to the red list - meaning UK residents and British and Irish nationals arriving home from those points of departure must undergo a 10-day hotel quarantine at their own expense. Speaking on Friday, Javid said it was ""highly likely"" the B.1.1.529 variant has spread beyond southern Africa. In a statement to the UK House of Commons Friday Javid expressed concern it may ""pose a substantial risk to public health."" European Union states have agreed to introduce temporary restrictions on all travel into the EU from southern Africa over the new Covid-19 variant, the bloc said Friday. Member states agreed to ""introduce rapidly restrictions on all travel into the EU from 7 countries in the Southern Africa region: Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe,"" said EU Commission spokesman Eric Mamer. Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan have also announced new restrictions on travelers coming from the region. Canada will be ""banning the entry of foreign nationals... that have traveled through southern Africa in the last 14 days,"" due to the new coronavirus variant, said Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos at a press conference on Friday. ""Canadians and permanent residents and those with a right of entry into Canada will be tested on arrival, [and] they will quarantine until they get the result of a negative test,"" according to Duclos. South Africa, like much of the region, has South Africa has fully vaccinated 35.37% of its adult population and has seen its rate of people initiating vaccination fall in recent days, according to data from the country's Department of Health.","Omicron, a new Covid-19 variant with high number of mutations, sparks travel bans and worries scientists"

We'll have to face this new threat just as we face those who have come before it,"" Biden said, speaking from the White House. The President noted scientists and officials are learning more every day about the new variant. He said the new travel restrictions his administration put in place, which went into effect Monday and restricted travel from several countries in Southern Africa, gives the US more time to respond. Biden said on Thursday he would put forward a ""detailed strategy outlining how we're going to fight Covid this winter. Not with shutdowns or lockdowns, but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing and more."" The President told reporters lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus were off the table ""for now."" ""If people are vaccinated and wear their mask, there's no need for lockdown,"" Biden said. The President again urged Americans to get vaccinated and get their booster shots, saying it is the best protection against this new variant, as well as any other variants. ""We have the best vaccine in the world, the best medicines, the best scientists, and we're learning more every single day. And we'll fight this variant with scientific and knowledgeable actions and speed - not chaos and confusion,"" Biden said. He continued: ""We have more tools today to fight the variant than we've ever had before, from vaccines to boosters to vaccines for children, 5 years and older and much more."" Biden was joined on Monday by Vice President Kamala Harris and his chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci. Officials briefed Biden for approximately 45 minutes Sunday on the new variant and again on Monday morning, with a heavy dose of caution about what's still unknown. Health officials Biden praised South African scientists for their transparency and quick work in identifying and reporting the new variant. ""This kind of transparency is to be encouraged and applauded because it increases our ability to respond quickly to any new threats, and that's exactly what we did,"" Biden said, adding that he does not believe the travel restrictions would make other countries less likely to report new variants. The President said: ""We needed time to give people an opportunity to say get that vaccination now before it, it's going to move around the world. I think it's almost inevitable that there will be at some point that strain here in the United States, but I don't think anyone is going to be reluctant to report."" Biden's team told him it will likely take one to Biden said to beat the pandemic, the world needs to be vaccinated, and said the US has shipped more than 275 million Covid-19 vaccines to 110 countries. ""Now we need the rest of the world to step us as well,"" Biden said. Fauci said Sunday that hopefully scientists will be able to make a determination soon on whether the Omicron variant is resistant to current Covid-19 vaccines. It's also too soon to tell whether Omicron causes more severe disease. Fauci said he doesn't think there's any possibility that Omicron could completely evade any protection from the vaccine, but that it may diminish the level of protection. If there is a diminution of protection, Fauci and other health officials said getting a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot could help enhance protection, since boosters enlarge the capacity of the body to recognize all kinds of mutations on coronavirus variants. Vaccine maker Moderna's chief medical officer told CNN that the Omicron variant has at least 50 mutations - including 30 on the key spike protein, which allows the virus to enter human cells, alone. He added that Omicron has thrown a ""new wrench"" into the fight against Covid-19, but emphasized that having some vaccination will help fight even a very altered and highly dangerous variant. Biden announced Friday the US would restrict travel from South Africa and seven other countries starting Monday because of the new variant. The Biden administration is now restricting travel from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi. The President was acting on advice from Fauci and the CDC. The Omicron variant has already been detected on five continents - North America, Australia, Africa, Europe, Asia - and the travel restrictions are already generating push back, with South Africa's Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation saying they are ""akin to punishing"" South Africa. The Omicron variant was the quickest to be labeled a ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization because of its seemingly fast spread in South Africa and its many troubling mutations. WHO designates coronavirus variants as either variants of concern - meaning they look dangerous enough to bear close scrutiny and continual updates - or as variants of interest, or variants under monitoring. Only five currently meet the definition for variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. ","Biden says new Omicron variant is 'cause for concern, not a cause for panic'"

In Victoria Island, an affluent Lagos neighborhood - an entirely new coastal city christened 'Eko Atlantic' - is being built on land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean, and will be protected from rising waters by an While the ambitious project could contribute to reducing housing shortages in other parts of the city, Ezekiel fears that ""reclaiming land from the sea will put pressure on other coastal areas."" Other critics David Frame, the Managing Director of Eko Atlantic told CNN the project ""isn't creating a problem"" for coastal communities. ""When dredging, we go between 20 and 25 kilometers out into the ocean because it is important to ensure the process does not impact the coastline and create erosion. This requires us to go further out to sea, beyond the 'Minus 15 Contour', which means we have to dredge in waters deeper than 15 meters,"" Frame said in a statement. ""During this process, we are not digging trenches. Instead, we trough along the seabed for half a meter to one-meter strips of sand. That way, we ensure we are not creating a problem,"" he added.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/29/us/greenland-ice-melting-climate-change/index.html,"CNN Greenland is experiencing its most significant melting event of the year as temperatures in the Arctic surge. The amount of ice that melted on Tuesday alone would be enough to cover the entire state of Florida in two inches of water. It's the third instance of extreme melting in the past decade, during which time the melting has stretched farther inland than the entire satellite era, which began in the 1970s. Greenland lost more than 8.5 billion tons of surface mass on Tuesday, and 18.4 billion tons since Sunday, according to the Denmark Meteorological Institute. While this week's total ice loss is not as extreme as a similar event in 2019 -- a ""It's a significant melt,"" Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, told CNN. ""July 27th saw most of the eastern half of Greenland from the northern tip all the way to the southern tip mostly melted, which is unusual."" As human-caused climate change warms the planet, ice loss has increased rapidly. According to a recent study published in the ""In the past decade, we've already seen that surface melting in Greenland has become both more severe and more erratic,"" said Thomas Slater, a glaciologist at the University of Leeds and a co-author on that report. ""As the atmosphere continues to warm over Greenland, events such as yesterday's extreme melting will become more frequent."" Although the current ice meltdown in Greenland isn't record-setting, the magnitude at which these events occur is a clear signal of how climate change is creating more melt periods. ""Overall, we're seeing that Greenland melts more often,"" said Scambos, who also authors the National Snow and Ice Data Center's Greenland updates. ""In previous decades or centuries, it's extremely rare to get above freezing temperatures at the summit of Greenland."" In 2019, Greenland shed roughly As Greenland's surface continues to thaw, Slater said coastal cities around the world are vulnerable to storm-surge flooding, especially when extreme weather coincides with high tides. Melting from Greenland is expected to raise global sea level between 2 and 10 centimeters by the end of the century, he added. Massive ice sheets can melt rapidly when the air temperature is warm. But warmer ocean water is also eroding the ice sheet around the edges. As humans release heat-trapping greenhouse gas, the warming atmosphere thaws the fresh white ice -- which reflects the sun's energy back into space -- on the surface. That exposes the darker ice below which absorbs solar energy and causes more melting. Additionally, warmer coastal water melts the ice sheet around the edges, breaking off massive icebergs that contribute to sea level rise. Scientists say the trends at which climate change is accelerating are quite clear, and that unless emissions are curbed, such extreme events will continue to occur more frequently. ""While such events are concerning, the science is clear,"" Slater said. ""Meaningful climate targets and action can still limit how much the global sea level will rise this century, reducing the damage done by severe flooding to people and infrastructure around the world.""",The amount of Greenland ice that melted on Tuesday could cover Florida in 2 inches of water
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/04/weather/global-flood-risk-climate-change/index.html,"CNN Amid a deadly summer of flooding in different parts of the world, scientists have found the number of people at risk to extreme flooding has grown significantly in the past two decades. In Germany, severe flooding claimed the lives of Climate change is making extreme flooding worse, and a ""It's not surprising that we're seeing really large floods that are potentially unprecedented affecting countries like China,"" Beth Tellman, lead author and co-founder of Cloud to Street, an analytics firm that developed the The study comes days before the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is set to release a Scientists at Cloud to Street, NASA, Google Earth and universities analyzed global flood exposure using satellite observations, creating the largest flood data set ever produced that maps the maximum extent of water during 913 large flood events between 2000 and 2018. ""It's great to have such a database that you can now test your model against, especially at a global scale,"" Guy Schumann, a research scientist not involved with the study, who specializes in flood data and modeling, told CNN. ""Everybody now wants to know what's going on globally, whereas traditionally, these databases or observations were only available at field measurement scales of a local or, at best at a national scale."" Using the database, scientists pinpointed where major flooding events have happened in the last two decades. They found that nearly 90% of flood events were in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in China and India - places where migration has increased significantly since 2000. Tellman, who has been working on this research for the past five years, said it ""was shocking"" to see the increase in flood events where population has also skyrocketed. And floodplains are now more frequently found in urban areas, she said. ""That was sort of the big 'aha!' moment for us,"" Tellman said, ""where we're like 'there is a really serious problem with floodplain-prone development.'"" From 2000 to 2015, approximately 58 to 86 million people moved to flood-prone regions, they found, which translates to a roughly 20% increase in the population exposed to floods. Flooding and the number of people exposed to it will continue to worsen, the study found. Thirty-two countries are already experiencing increasing floods, and 25 new countries will be added to that list by 2030 unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly curbed, researchers found. Low-income communities are often the most at risk, since they tend to have no choice but to settle in less-favorable, less-expensive areas that are more prone to flooding. ""It's not like people are necessarily wanting or choosing to live in a place at high risk, but they may have no other option or no public housing program in their country,"" Tellman said. In 2007, for example, floods from a Beyond flooding from heavy rainfall, tropical storms and melting snow, the database also accounts for flooding caused by dam failures. While they represented less than 2% of flood events, dam breaks had the highest increase in occurrence from 2000 to 2015 - 177% - that exposed vulnerable populations. Tellman said it's probably because of what hydrologists call the ""levee effect."" ""When we have infrastructure like a dam or levee, people feel safe and feel like that land is protected, so it increases in value, and we build things there,"" she said. ""The problem is, if the dam isn't maintained, then it can become a massive hazard and affect so many people."" In 2008, embankments along the Koshi River collapsed and destroyed the homes of more than 3 million people in India and Nepal. In 2018, heavy rain and a subsequent release of water from the Bagre Dam in Burkina Faso flooded thousands of hectares of agricultural land in the neighboring country of Ghana, which worsened food insecurity in the region. Researchers say such incidents demonstrate the deadly cost of failing infrastructure, exacerbated by climate change. Philip Ward, a professor of global water risk dynamics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, told CNN the study's findings emphasize the importance of maintaining aging infrastructure and strengthening resilience. He also said the results suggest officials should put more resources into warnings. ""We need to make sure that there are still early warning systems, evacuation plans and good communication between the most vulnerable, political officials, emergency responders, and so forth,"" said Ward, who was not involved with the study. Satellite observations capture realities that are not often captured by predictive climate models, according to Tellman. Most maps of flood-prone areas, including those used by government agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, rely on models that simulate floods based on historical data, the results of which can be limited as climate change pushes flooding into unprecedented territory. Outside experts said Cloud to Street's population analysis will strengthen the data they already have, especially as the climate changes. ""The most important thing from this research is the database itself,"" Ward said. ""As somebody who models flood risks, these data really will allow us to better validate the models and check the models against reality."" As climate change fuels more extreme and far-reaching floods, Tellman hopes the new analysis will encourage policymakers to invest in equitable climate adaptation measures in places where flood exposure has grown faster than the surrounding population. ""Who gets impacted by floods really is in our control,"" Tellman said.","Floods are getting worse, and the number of people exposed is 10 times higher than previously thought, study finds"

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/23/health/covid-ba2-omicron-studies-explainer/index.html,"CNN On the heels of concerning new lab and animal experiments suggesting that BA.2 may be capable of causing more severe disease than the original Omicron strain, two new studies are helping to show how well human immunity is defending against BA.2 is about Even as Covid-19 cases have been dropping around the world, the relative proportion of cases caused by BA.2 has been increasing. It is outcompeting the original Omicron strain in ""As of now, I don't think that we need to sound a global alarm. But I do think that we need to pay attention to BA.2 because it does appear to have a growth advantage over BA.1,"" says Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Like the BA.1 strain, BA.2 also has features that help it escape some immunity from vaccines and from most monoclonal antibody treatments, though recent boosters Now new studies are providing some reassurance that while BA.2 may overtake its genetically distant cousin, it won't likely lead to greater numbers of hospitalizations and deaths. ""The situation that we're seeing on the ground, and I get this from talking to a number of my colleagues who actually do the genomic surveillance, is BA.2 is kind of creeping up in terms of numbers, but it's not the meteoric rise that we saw with BA.1,"" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. That's because in many countries like the US, UK, and Denmark, BA.2 has hit speed bumps left in its wake by BA.1, which was already very contagious. ""It's so soon after that initial BA.1 peak that you have a lot of people who were either vaccinated or boosted ... [or] got Omicron, and so right now all of those people will have relatively high titers of antibodies, neutralizing antibodies that will protect against infection,"" Rasmussen says. The new studies are preprints, which means they were posted to an online library of medical research before being reviewed by outside experts and published in medical journals. No increase in hospitalizations The first After researchers accounted for things that might influence a person's risk of severe disease, such as older age, they found no difference in the risk for hospitalization between people infected by BA.1 and those infected by BA.2. Roughly one-quarter of people hospitalized with both BA.1 and BA.2 infections were fully vaccinated. Those findings echo hospitalization studies from Denmark, where BA.2 is also the predominant cause of Covid-19 infections. The lead researcher on the South African study ""We have seen an extended wave which has currently plateaued at a higher level than we have seen in previous inter-wave periods,"" Wolter wrote in an email to CNN. ""This may however also be influenced by schools opening following the December holiday period and a general relaxing of restrictions,"" wrote Wolter, who is a principal medical scientist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg. Though cases have stayed at a high level, and most are now caused by BA.2, hospitalizations have continued to decline. What about reinfection risk? The The study found that people who've recently had a Covid-19 infection caused by Omicron or Delta can be reinfected by the emerging BA.2 subvariant, but such cases appear to be uncommon, afflict mostly those who are unvaccinated and result in mostly mild infections. BA.2 is currently the dominant cause of Covid-19 in Denmark. It overtook BA.1 during the second week of January there. To look at reinfection risk, researchers combed through more than 140,000 viral genomes that were sequenced from infections during the period when Omicron became dominant (late November to mid-February 2022) to find people who had a new positive test 20 to 60 days after a previous one. They found a total of 263 reinfections, with 190 of those caused by the BA.2 variant. In 140 cases, the person was reinfected by BA.2 after an infection caused by the Delta variant.  There were 47 cases where people were first infected by BA.1 (the original Omicron variant) followed by the BA.2 subvariant. Researchers then did a more in-depth analysis of those 47 reinfections where BA.2 followed BA.1.  Most of the individuals who were reinfected were young - 30 were under age 20.  None of the reinfected individuals was over age 40 and nearly all - 42 of the 47 individuals - were unvaccinated. For the most part, reinfections were mild; 28 people had no symptoms or mild symptoms. Five people experienced symptoms that were characterized as moderate, akin to flu-like symptoms. There were no hospitalizations or deaths reported among reinfected individuals. The study shows that ""reinfection can happen with people who recently recovered from BA;1, but it's pretty rare. And in all those cases, it wasn't severe,"" says Rasmussen, who reviewed the study but was not involved in the research.

The three tech startups, along with a handful of other Chinese firms like AI-driven surveillance camera maker Hikvision and voice recognition firm iFlyTek, are now banned from buying US products or importing American technology. The US Commerce Department added them to a trade blacklist this week, saying the companies had been implicated in human rights violations against Uyghurs and other members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. Twenty government and security bureaus in China's Xinjiang region were also included in the ban. Chinese authorities dismissed the human rights allegations, and threatened retaliation against US companies. ""The US accusations against China are groundless and senseless. They only expose the evil motives of the United States to interfere with counterterrorism efforts in Xinjiang and thwart China's development,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday, telling reporters to ""stay tuned"" for retaliation. Beijing wants to turn China into a global AI leader by 2030. In 2017, it set out goals to build a domestic artificial intelligence industry worth about $150 billion in the next few years. The potential economic and social benefits for AI breakthroughs are enormous. AI-powered machines are already being used to provide customer service, manage logistics, monitor equipment on factory floors, optimize energy consumption, and analyze medical records, according to a 2017 study from consulting firm McKinsey. McKinsey estimates that the total market for AI applications will reach $127 billion by 2025.

Chinese AI companies rely on computer chips and graphics processing units from US companies such as Qualcomm In a note this week, the Eurasia Group called the US move ""especially aggressive"" given The tech firms are some of China's most prominent in the areas of facial recognition and artificial intelligence. Hikvision is a $42 billion company and the world's largest video surveillance gear maker. SenseTime and iFlyTek were named to China's National AI team in 2017. While the move is ""aimed more at the Xinjiang issue and not squarely at China's AI ambitions,"" it does fit into a broader narrative within the US government, said Paul Triolo, who specializes in global technology policy at Eurasia Group. The ""United States and China are in a long term struggle for dominating the technologies of the future, and part of that narrative is that China is using technologies such as AI in the service of government surveillance and in ways that go against Western values in terms of things like privacy,"" he said. Megvii tried to downplay its dependence on American suppliers, saying in a statement that its supply chain is global and ""the US is just one part of it."" In a Megvii also said ""there are no grounds"" for the company being added to Washington's trade blacklist. ""We are ... in compliance with all laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl/index.html,"CNN Russia has launched an Ukrainian ministers said the Kremlin had begun a ""full-scale invasion"" of their country, and the fighting appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Markets across the globe plunged.  Attacks and explosions have been reported throughout Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, where air sirens rang out Thursday morning and afternoon. Russian forces appeared to be encircling the city and looked poised to invade, Ukraine's deputy interior minister told CNN. Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government. In a video statement late Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said he believes ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered Kyiv and that he was their No. 1 target. His family, he said, was the second target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said, adding he was staying in the government quarter. Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact, but has declared state of emergency that will begin Friday. In an emotional speech Thursday afternoon, Zelensky called on world leaders for support, warning that if Ukraine doesn't get help now, ""war will come knocking at your door tomorrow."" According to preliminary figures, 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed since the invasion began early Thursday, Zelensky said, with another 316 soldiers wounded. In a declaration signed late Thursday, Zelensky ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations."" At the same time, the country barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service. Western leaders were united in their swift US President Joe Biden said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""committed an assault on the very principles that uphold the global peace."" ""Now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin allies are really all about,"" Biden said Biden announced ""Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" said Biden. Speaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war"" and said it put ""countless innocent lives"" at risk. ""Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on the scale and of the type we thought belonged to history,"" he said. ""NATO allies condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. It is a blatant violation of international law, an act of aggression against a sovereign independent and peaceful country."" NATO will increase land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank, the security alliance said in a statement. Russians give their rationale for invasion Putin had kept the international community on a knife's edge for months, as the world watched and waited to see what exactly the Kremlin planned to do with After repeatedly denying any plans to invade Ukraine, Putin said in a televised address early Thursday that Russia would be conducting a military operation in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which contains Donetsk and Luhansk, the separatist-held regions that Moscow recognized as independent on Monday - in violation of international law. Putin said earlier this week he was ordering troops to the breakaway enclaves to act as ""peacekeepers."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told foreign journalists that the ""demilitarization and denazification"" of Ukraine are among the objectives of Russia's military action in the country. ""Ideally, Ukraine should be liberated, cleansed of Nazis, of pro-Nazi people and ideology,"" Peskov said, though he refused to say if that meant regime change in Kyiv. The Russian claim of a need to ""denazify"" Ukraine is one Putin has touted repeatedly over the years and is baseless. Zelensky, the Ukrainian President, is Jewish. The Russian strongman urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and go home, saying all responsibility for possible bloodshed would be entirely on the conscience of the Ukrainian government. ""Our plans are not to occupy Ukraine, we do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he said, but threatened ""those who may be tempted to intervene"" on Ukraine's behalf. ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never experienced in your history,"" he said. Invasion launched before dawn The first blasts were heard at around 5 a.m. local time Thursday, and it quickly became clear that Moscow's military assault was not limited to eastern Ukraine. CNN teams on the ground heard explosions in and near multiple Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv; the second-largest city, Kharkiv; Odessa; and distant firing from Zaporizhzhiya. Ukrainian officials said on social media that Russia was staging attacks far and wide, shelling control centers such as airfields and military headquarters in Kyiv and Kharkiv. The Russian military has, according to a senior US defense official, been targeting ""military and air defense"" targets, meaning ""barracks, ammunition warehouses, nearly 10 airfields,"" the official said. Images released by Zelensky's office showed large explosions to the east of Kyiv with huge columns of smoke rising into the air. At least seven people were killed and 17 were wounded in a missile attack on a military area northeast of the capital, Ukrainian authorities said. Zelensky said Ukrainian forces were doing ""exceptionally"" in the Donbas region, and while Russian troops were slowly advancing in the Chernihiv region in Ukraine's north, Ukrainian defenses were holding elsewhere. Russian forces did Ukraine's borders were reportedly under attack from Russian forces to the north in Belarus and the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. The Russian military claimed Ukraine's border service ""did not provide any resistance"" and claimed to have ""suppressed"" Ukraine's air defenses. CNN was not able to immediately verify either of those claims. Three military facilities in the western Lviv region were attacked, according to the regional governor. Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN that Ukrainian troops had retreated from ""fierce fighting"" with Russian forces for control of the strategic Antonov air base on the outskirts of the Kyiv but were staging a counterattack. Earlier Thursday, large numbers of helicopters dropped Russian troops at the air base to secure it, he said. A CNN team spoke with Russian airborne troops on the perimeter of the air base, only about 20 miles from the heart of the capital, and heard exchanges of fire with Ukrainian forces. Civilians hide in subway stations amid fighting The violence near the capital forced families to crowd into subway stations, as city authorities issued an air raid warning and urged residents to seek shelter underground. Across the country, Ukraine's subway stations are doubling as bomb shelters, as the assault continues and fears of strikes grow. Heavy traffic could be seen clogging roads heading west out of the capital as dawn broke, while further east, near the Russian border, the mayor of Kharkiv urged citizens not to leave their homes. Ukrainians have largely remained divided about the possibility of a Russian invasion, hoping that the military buildup was just the latest in Moscow's mind games. After months of ratcheting up tensions, the wide-scale military assault still came as a shock - especially in Kyiv, where residents had, until Wednesday, continued to go about their daily lives as foreign governments withdrew their diplomatic staff from the capital. ""You wake up at 5 a.m. to a totally new reality, and you find out the world is no longer the safe place you imagined,"" one woman in Kharkiv ""I can't believe it's happening, really."" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. local time, and the capital went dark late Thursday as residents left the streets deserted and either switched off their lights or drew their curtains. While major details about the incursion - including total casualties - remain shrouded in the fog of war,  UK military intelligence earlier said Russia also deployed 75 fixed-wing heavy and medium bombers in the initial attack and initiated ""some ground incursions"" into Ukraine from Belarus, northwest of Kyiv, the US official added.

Currently, a booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines are recommended for all adults who completed the original two-dose series of those shots at least six months ago, and a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is recommended for adults who completed a single shot at least two months ago. It was about six months ago - in May - when the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of Pfizer's coronavirus ""We don't know yet if children will need boosters.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/ba-2-covid-severity/index.html,"CNN The BA.2 virus - a subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant - isn't just spreading faster than its distant cousin, it may also cause more severe disease and appears capable of thwarting some of the key weapons we have against Covid-19, new research suggests. New lab experiments from And like Omicron, it appears to largely escape the immunity created by vaccines. A booster shot restores protection, making illness after infection about 74% less likely. BA.2 is also resistant to some treatments, including sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody that's currently being used against Omicron. The findings were posted Wednesday as a ""It might be, from a human's perspective, a worse virus than BA.1 and might be able to transmit better and cause worse disease,"" says Dr. Daniel Rhoads, section head of microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Rhoads reviewed the study but was not involved in the research. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is keeping close watch on BA.2, said its director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky. ""There is no evidence that the BA.2 lineage is more severe than the BA.1 lineage. CDC continues to monitor variants that are circulating both domestically and internationally,"" she said Friday. ""We will continue to monitor emerging data on disease severity in humans and findings from papers like this conducted in laboratory settings."" BA.2 is highly mutated compared with the original Covid-causing virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. It also has dozens of gene changes that are different from the original Omicron strain, making it as distinct from the most recent pandemic virus as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were from each other. Kei Sato, a researcher at the University of Tokyo who conducted the study, argues that these findings prove that BA.2 should not be considered a type of Omicron and that it needs to be more closely monitored. ""As you may know, BA.2 is called 'stealth Omicron,' "" Sato told CNN. That's because it doesn't show up on PCR tests as an S-gene target failure, the way Omicron does.  Labs therefore have to take an extra step and sequence the virus to find this variant. ""Establishing a method to detect BA.2 specifically would be the first thing"" many countries need to do, he says. ""It looks like we might be looking at a new Greek letter here,"" agreed Deborah Fuller, a virologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but was not part of the research. Mixed real-world data on subvariant's severity BA.2 has been estimated to be about 30% more contagious than Omicron, according to the World Health Organization. It has been detected in 74 countries and 47 US states. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 4% of Americans with Covid-19 now have infections caused by BA.2, but many other parts of the world have more experience with this variant. It has become dominant in at least 10 other countries: Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Denmark, Guam, India, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines, according to World Health Organization's weekly epidemiological report. However, there's mixed evidence on the severity of BA.2 in the real world. Hospitalizations continue to decline in countries where BA.2 has gained a foothold, like South Africa and the UK.  But in Denmark, where BA.2 has become the leading cause of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are rising, according to WHO. Resistant to monoclonal antibody treatments The new study found that BA.2 can copy itself in cells more quickly than BA.1, the original version of Omicron.  It's also more adept at causing cells to stick together.  This allows the virus to create larger clumps of cells, called syncytia, than BA.1.  That's concerning because these clumps then become factories for churning out more copies of the virus. Delta was also good at creating syncytia, which is thought to be one reason it was so destructive to the lungs. When the researchers infected hamsters with BA.2 and BA.1, the animals infected with BA.2 got sicker and had worse lung function. In tissues samples, the lungs of BA.2-infected hamsters had more damage than those infected by BA.1. Similar to the original Omicron, BA.2 was capable of breaking through antibodies in the blood of people who'd been vaccinated against Covid-19.  It was also resistant to the antibodies of people who'd been infected with Covid-19 early in the pandemic, including Alpha and Delta.  And BA.2 was almost completely resistant to some monoclonal antibody treatments. But there was a bright spot:  Antibodies in the blood of people who'd recently had Omicron also seemed to have some protection against BA.2, especially if they'd also been vaccinated. And that raises an important point, Fuller says.  Even though BA.2 seems more contagious and pathogenic than Omicron, it may not wind up causing a more devastating wave of Covid-19 infections. ""One of the caveats that we have to think about as we get new variants that might seem more dangerous is the fact that there's two sides to the story,"" Fuller says. The virus matters, she says, but as its would-be hosts, so do we. ""Our immune system is evolving as well. And so that's pushing back on things,"" she said. Right now, she says, we're in a race against the virus, and the key question is, who's in the lead? ""What we will ultimately want is to have the host be ahead of the virus. In other words, our immunity, be a step ahead of the next variant that comes out, and I don't know that we're quite there yet,"" she said. For that reason, Fuller says, she feels like it's not quite time for communities to lift mask mandates. ""Before this thing came out, we were about 10 feet away from the finish line,"" she said. ""Taking off the masks now is not a good idea. It's just going to extend it. Let's get to the finish line.""","As BA.2 subvariant of Omicron rises, lab studies point to signs of severity"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/19/world/netherlands-germany-flood-defense-warning-system-intl-cmd/index.html,"CNN As communities devastated by the But at least 195 But few of these early warnings appear to have been passed on to residents early - and clearly - enough, catching them completely off guard. Now questions are being raised over whether the chain of communication from the central European level to regions is working. ""There was clearly a serious breakdown in communication, which in some cases has tragically cost people's lives,"" said Jeff Da Costa, a PhD researcher in hydrometeorology at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. Da Costa focuses on flood warning systems in his research, and his own parents' home in Luxembourg happened to be hit over the weekend. He said the experiences of the past week show there is often a gap between the weather warnings scientists issue and the actions actually taken by people in charge on the ground. Some of the warnings - including in Luxembourg - were only issued after the flood had hit, he said. ""People, including my own family, were left to their own devices without any indication on what to do, and giving them no opportunity to prepare themselves,"" he said. In many badly affected places, residents were overwhelmed by the speed and ferociousness with which the water came. In Germany, with an election approaching, the issue of flooding has quickly become politicized, and officials are deflecting blame where they can. In the Ahr valley, one particularly badly flooded area in western Germany, senior officials told CNN that warnings were issued ahead of the disaster, but said many residents didn't take them seriously enough, because they were so unaccustomed to such intense flooding. Some might have attempted to collect provisions and move their valuables to safety, while others thought they would be safe on the second floor of their homes but ended up having to be airlifted off the roof. One of the worst affected towns was Schuld, a picturesque town in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Schuld Mayor Helmut Lussi said the flood was utterly unpredictable, pointing to the fact that the town had only experienced to two previous events of intense flooding, in 1790 and another in 1910. ""I think that flood protection systems would not have helped me because you cannot calculate this, what happens to the river Ahr with such masses of water,"" he told reporters over the weekend. Da Costa said he can sympathize with the mayor, but that his remarks show a lack of understanding in what good planning and management can do. ""His views on the predictability of floods, both on the long-term scale and the immediate scale of being able to provide immediate warnings, are completely wrong, and may go to show one of the difficulties in communicating risk to people or municipal officials who fundamentally don't understand environmental risk,"" he said. ""People should also bear in mind that while flood warnings can't stop a flood, they can help people move themselves, and their possessions, to safety,"" he added. Da Costa said that as extreme weather events become more common because of ""If the mayor of Schuld and his town had a plan, clearly communicated to every household and businesses and institution, so that everyone knew what to do in the event of a range of different flooding scenarios, then at least they would be as well prepared as they could be,"" he said, adding that if he and other regional leaders had done so, less people may have died. ""In times of crisis, everyone needs to know what they are doing. This is why we rehearse fire evacuations from buildings, even when we don't expect there to be a fire,"" he said. CNN has contacted Lussi's office but did not immediately receive a response. In Belgium, too, communication and organization appear to have been problems. The mayor of Chaudfontaine, a town in the province of Liege, said he received an ""orange alert"" warning him of rising waters but argued it clearly should have been red earlier. ""We could see how the available material wasn't adapted to the situations that we saw. I'm thinking notably about helicopters that weren't able to work in the area,"" Mayor Daniel Bacquelaine told Belgian broadcaster RTBF.  ""The boat rescues were absolutely essential and we had to call upon the private sector for boats with sufficient motor power and people to pilot them."" Dutch lessons In the Netherlands, just across its borders with Germany's and Belgium's flood-devastated areas, the picture is entirely different. The Netherlands too experienced extreme rainfall - albeit not quite as heavy as those in Germany and Belgium - and it hasn't escaped unscathed. But its towns are not entirely submerged and not a single person has died. Officials were better prepared and were able to communicate with people quickly, said Professor Jeroen Aerts, head of the Water and Climate Risk department at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. ""We better saw the wave coming, and where it was going,"" Aerts told CNN. The Netherlands has a long history of water management and their success in the face of this disaster may offer the world a blueprint on how to handle floods, especially as climate change is expected to make extreme rain events more common. The country has been battling the sea and swollen rivers for nearly a millennium. Three large European rivers - the Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt - have their deltas in the Netherlands, and with much of its land below the sea level, the government says 60% of the country is at flood risk. Much of the country is essentially sinking. Its water management infrastructure is among the best in the world - involving giant walls with moveable arms the size of two football fields, coastal dunes that are reinforced with some 12 million cubic meters of sand per year, and simple things, like dikes and giving rivers more room to swell by lowering their beds - or floors - and expanding their banks. Its strength lies largely in its organization. The country's infrastructure is managed by a branch of government devoted solely to water, the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management, which looks after some 1,500 kilometers of man-made defenses. The country's water problems are managed by a network of locally elected bodies whose sole function is to care for all things water, from flood to waste water, Aerts said. The first of these local ""water boards"" was established in the city of Leiden in 1255 - that's how along ago the country realized it needed robust water management. ""This is a unique situation that we have,"" Aerts said. ""Apart from the national government, the provinces, and cities, you have a fourth layer, the water boards, which are entirely focused on water management."" The boards have the ability to levy taxes independently, so they are not subject to the ups and downs of the national coffers. ""Water is involved in the tourism sector, it is involved in industry, in the building sector,"" Aerts said. ""And what you see is that in different countries is that the policies from governments are really sectoral."" In the Netherlands, he called water boards the ""glue"" that hold everything together, and can make sure, for example, that a proposal to build on a flood plain has all the relevant parties in communication. The water management agency's website sums ups simply and clearly what it's trying to do. ""It's raining more, the sea is rising, and rivers need to carry ever more water,"" it reads. ""Protecting against high water is and remains existential."" ","Deadly floods inundated parts of Europe, but the Netherlands avoided fatalities. Here's why"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/07/politics/biden-putin-call-ukraine/index.html,"CNN The White House says ""I will look you in the eye and tell you, as President Biden looked Putin in the eye and told him today, that things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Tuesday afternoon after Biden's call with Putin. During the last several months, Sullivan did not go into specifics, but added that the US is coordinating with European allies ""at a deep level of specificity."" He said Biden ""was direct and straightforward with President Putin, as he always is,"" later adding that ""there was a lot of give and take. There was no finger-wagging, but the President was crystal clear about where the United States stands on all of these issues."" Along with the economic ramifications mentioned on the call, Sullivan said Biden relayed that the US is prepared to bolster defense capabilities in the region. ""He reiterated America's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He told President Putin directly that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,"" Sullivan said. ""We would provide additional defensive materiel to the Ukrainians above and beyond that which we are already providing, and we would fortify our NATO allies on the eastern flank with additional capabilities in response to such an escalation."" The other option, Sullivan said, is de-escalation and diplomacy. ""The United States and our European allies would engage in a larger discussion that covers strategic issues, including our strategic concerns with Russia and Russia's strategic concerns. We managed to do this at the height of the Cold War and we developed mechanisms to help reduce instability and increase transparency,"" he said. A call in the Situation Room Biden and Putin spoke for about two hours over a secure video call earlier Tuesday. The two presidents tasked their respective teams with following up on their discussions, with the White House adding that ""the US will do so in close coordination with allies and partners."" In addition to the Ukraine issue, the two leaders discussed ""the US-Russia dialogue on Strategic Stability, a separate dialogue on ransomware, as well as joint work on regional issues such as Iran,"" the White House said. A White House photograph from the meeting, which began at 10:07 a.m. ET and ended at 12:08 p.m. ET, showed that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Sullivan and senior director for Russia and Central Asia Eric Green were seated next to Biden in the Situation Room during the video call. The two leaders took part in a Later Tuesday afternoon, Biden spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom - the same group of European allies he conferred with Monday night. Tuesday marks Merkel's final full day in office. Biden briefed the allies on the Putin call and, according to a White House statement, the ""leaders underscored their support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the need for Russia to reduce tensions and engage in diplomacy."" Sullivan said during Tuesday's press briefing that the White House team was debriefing the embassies of NATO members, European Union members and key Indo-Pacific allies on the US-Russia call. Biden will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday. Biden is also expected to speak with the leaders of both houses of Congress to discuss ""ways in which the administration and the Congress can work together on a bipartisan basis to stand up for American interests and values and stand behind our friends and partners,"" Sullivan added. The Russians said in their readout of the Biden-Putin meeting that Ukraine was the ""predominant"" subject of the conversation and Biden had ""emphasized the allegedly 'threatening' nature of the movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian borders and outlined sanctions measures that the United States and its allies would be ready to apply in the event of a further escalation of the situation."" ""In response, Vladimir Putin stressed that the responsibility should not be shifted onto the shoulders of Russia, since it is NATO that is making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory and is building up its military potential at our borders,"" the Kremlin statement said. ""Therefore, Russia is seriously interested in obtaining reliable, legally fixed guarantees excluding the expansion of NATO in the eastern direction and the deployment of offensive strike weapons systems in the states adjacent to Russia."" Putin aide Yury Ushakov told reporters on a conference call Tuesday night that the Russian President told Biden while Americans are worried about Russian troops thousands of kilometers away from the United States, Moscow is ""really worried about our security, the security of Russia in a global sense."" Asked if Putin promised Biden that he would not use his troops in Ukraine, Ushakov dismissed the idea of an invasion. ""There was not even such a discussion. What do you mean to bring in troops, what is it - an invasion, or what? This was out of the question,"" Ushakov said. Measures under consideration US officials in recent days have weighed The officials said final decisions hadn't been made on whether and when to apply the new sanctions, and said the Biden administration is currently in talks with European partners - many of whom have closer economic relationships to Russia - in the hopes of coordinating action. Along with considerations of economic sanctions, the administration is also exploring options for a potential evacuation of US citizens from Ukraine if Russia were to invade the country and create a dire security situation, Nuland said on Tuesday that it is the US expectation that the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline ""will be suspended"" if Russia moves on Ukraine. But the White House relayed that while conversations are being had with Germany about the pipeline in the context of a potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia, taking action may not necessarily be the most effective deterrent against Russian aggression. The European Union ""continues to fully support Ukraine in the face of the Russian aggression,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a tweet on Tuesday. ""We will respond to any further aggressions, by scaling-up and expanding existing sanctions,"" she added. She also said the EU was ""ready to take additional restrictive measures, in coordination with our partners."" ""The rise of extremism and autocracy can also be a security issue for countries. In this context, we must also speak about the Russian military movements and their massive build-up along Ukraine's eastern border,"" she continued.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/24/health/covid-19-reinfection-is-rare-severe-disease-rarer/index.html,"CNN When people got reinfected with Covid-19, their odds of ending up in the hospital or dying were 90% lower than an initial Covid-19 infection, according to a The study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine found that there were few confirmed reinfections among 353,326 people who got Covid-19 in Qatar, and the re-infections were rare and generally mild. The first wave of infections in Qatar struck between March and June of 2020. In the end about 40% of the population had detectable antibodies against Covid-19. The country then had two more waves from January through May of 2021. This was prior to the more infectious delta variant. To determine how many people got reinfected, scientists from Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar compared the records of people with PCR-confirmed infections between February of 2020 and April 2021. They excluded 87,547 people who got the vaccine. Researchers found that among the remaining cases there were 1,304 reinfections. The median time between the first illness and reinfection was about 9 months. Among those with reinfections, there were only four cases severe enough that they had to go to the hospital. There were no cases where people were sick enough that they needed to be treated in the intensive care unit. Among the initial cases, 28 were considered critical. There were no deaths among the reinfected group, while there were seven deaths in the initial infections. ""When you have only 1,300 reinfections among that many people, and four cases of severe disease, that's pretty remarkable,"" said John Alcorn, an expert in immunology and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh who was not affiliated with this study. The study has limits. It was done in Qatar, so it's not clear if the virus would behave the same way anywhere else. The work was done when the alpha and beta variant were the cause of many re-infections. There were 621 cases where it was undetermined and 213 from a ""wild type"" virus. There was no mention of the delta variant, which is now the predominant strain. That could have an impact on the number of reinfections.  Alcorn's own research on natural immunity shows that antibody levels also vary significantly from person to person. Scientists still don't know what level of antibodies is protective, but in some cases, levels after infection may not be enough to keep someone from getting sick again. ""It needs to be determined whether such protection against severe disease at reinfection lasts for a longer period, analogous to the immunity that develops against other seasonal 'common-cold' coronaviruses, which elicit short-term immunity against mild reinfection but longer-term immunity against more severe illness with reinfection,"" the study said. ""If this were the case with SARS-CoV-2, the virus (or at least the variants studied to date) could adopt a more benign pattern of infection when it becomes endemic."" Dr. Kami Kim, an infectious disease specialist who is not affiliated with this study, said people need to be careful not to come away with the wrong impression that it means people don't need to get vaccinated if they've been sick with Covid-19. ""It's sort of like asking the question do you need airbags and seat belts?"" said Kim, director of the University of South Florida's Division of Infectious Disease & International Medicine. ""Just because you have airbags doesn't mean that seatbelts won't help you and vice versa. It's good to have the protection of both."" Kim said it isn't worth taking your chances with the disease, particularly because an infection could bring with it long-term effects. ""The incidence of long-Covid is way higher than the risk of getting a vaccine,"" Kim said. Also vaccinations don't just protect an individual from getting sick, it protects the community. ""Modern medicine is much better, and people get cancer and survive and autoimmune diseases and thrive. Unless you are super close, you don't always know who is vulnerable to more severe disease, and you literally could be putting people you care about at risk if you get sick and expose them,"" Kim said. ""Without vaccination you can't go back to a normal life."" Limiting the number of illnesses also limits the potential of more variants to develop, variants that could be even more dangerous than what's in circulation now. Alcorn said there's another important lesson from this study. ""Vaccines are still our best method to get to the same place these people that have been infected are, absolutely,"" Alcorn said. ""The major takeaway from this study here is that there's hope that through vaccination and through infection recovery that we'll get to the level where everybody has some level of protection.""","Reinfection from Covid-19 is rare, severe disease is even rarer, a study of people in Qatar finds"

""Never waste a crisis, they say!"" Damodar Mall, chief executive of grocery retail at Reliance Retail, tweeted Saturday. Mall added that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Amazon But JioMart's launch ""is a reason for worry for Amazon and Flipkart, [because they] are not very strong in grocery,"" said Satish Meena, analyst with research firm Forrester. Flipkart launched online grocery deliveries in 2017, while Amazon has been delivering fresh food in India since 2016. Amazon and Flipkart have also faced difficulty delivering orders across India during the Covid-19 pandemic because of varying levels of restrictions from one city to the next, he said. Flipkart had to temporarily suspend services in March when the nationwide lockdown began, and Amazon had to to limit orders as it responded to increased demand. Flipkart and other e-commerce companies have worked to deliver essential goods ""despite the various complexities and challenges of zonal restrictions, supply chain disruption and general safety of their employees and delivery [people],"" a Flipkart spokesperson said in a statement. The lockdown required the company expedite expansion plans, including ramping up warehouse capacities to cover more zip codes for the grocery business, the spokesperson added. JioMart launched late last year, with the goal of getting 30 million kiranas, small neighborhood mom and pop shops, online. Grocery is 70% of the Indian retail market, and more than 90% of the market is unorganized and driven by kirana stores, according to investment research firm Bernstein. The overall retail market is expected to double in size from $676 billion in 2018 to nearly $1.3 trillion by 2025, according to Bernstein. India's online grocery market is small by comparison, worth around $3 billion this year, according to Forrester. But the firm said that number is growing fast, as the pandemic is quickly changing people's shopping habits. Bernstein and Forrester analysts say JioMart is well placed to disrupt the online grocery market because it can source supplies from Reliance's brick-and-mortar stores.

She confirmed that although Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, has noted that there is still much uncertainty as to how the pandemic may further evolve, he also has said it is possible that a fourth dose might be recommended as we move into fall. A fall timeline coincides with the administration of flu shots, which could be convenient for people and makes sense scientifically because respiratory viruses - like the coronavirus and influenza - tend to ""As more data become available about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including the use of a booster dose, we will continue to evaluate the rapidly changing science and keep the public informed,"" Hunt wrote. ""Any determination that additional booster doses are needed will be based on data available to the agency."" If or when the FDA authorizes a fourth dose for the public, the next step would be for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to review the data before making a recommendation for use, as the agency has done for other coronavirus vaccine recommendations. 'Vaccination and boosting will be critical' The United States has seen significant improvements recently in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. As of Friday, cases were down 44% from the prior week, hospitalizations dropped 26%, and deaths were 13% lower, according to Johns Hopkins University data. ""Vaccination and boosting will be critical in maintaining that downward trajectory, particularly when you're talking about the red curve of severe disease leading to hospitalization,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a The ""potential future requirement"" for an additional boost or a fourth shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines or a third dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine ""is being very carefully monitored in real time,"" Fauci said. ""And recommendations, if needed, will be updated according to the data as it evolves."" The CDC has no recommendation of fourth doses of coronavirus vaccine for the general public, but the agency ""For the immunocompetent people, a single booster shot continues to provide high levels of protection against severe disease caused by Omicron,"" Fauci said Wednesday. ""This should not be confused with the fact that for many immunocompromised people, already a second booster shot - namely a fourth dose of an mRNA - is recommended because of what we know about their poor response to the initial regimen."" Meanwhile, vaccine makers continue to study fourth doses in broader populations. 'We recognize the need to be prepared' Pfizer announced in January that it has been studying the safety and efficacy of a fourth dose as part of its For that study, participants have been separated into three cohorts. One includes 600 people who got three doses of the current Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine before enrolling in the study. As part of the research, they will receive either a fourth dose of the current vaccine or a dose of the Omicron-based vaccine. ""While current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization with Omicron, we recognize the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address Omicron and new variants in the future,"" Kathrin Jansen, senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in the company's announcement of the study. A With the Omicron variant dominant in the United States, vaccine effectiveness was 87% against Covid-19 emergency department or urgent care visits and 91% against hospitalizations in the two months after a third dose. Effectiveness fell to 66% and 78%, respectively, by the fourth month, the data showed. ""Nonetheless, the level of 78 is still a good protective area,"" Fauci said Wednesday. Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN on Friday that he thinks having a fourth dose ""makes very little sense"" right now - but possibly makes more sense this upcoming fall or winter. ""Because Omicron is going away,"" he said, ""third dose immunity wanes, and so fourth dose will probably wane as well. So we would want to time a fourth-dose push for when either there's a new variant or for next winter. So I think right now, unless you're immunocompromised or you're older, unless you have some personal risk, it doesn't make a lot of sense."" The research showing some waning immunity after a third dose has led to more discussion around if or when fourth doses could be needed. ""Just like with everything else, the health departments look at this data that's coming out and wait for guidance from the CDC and from the drug manufacturers. The drug manufacturers have been monitoring vaccine effectiveness,"" Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Friday. The timing for fourth doses not only depends on waning immunity ""but also depends on whether we see any more variants emerge and what we discover in terms of additional vaccine effectiveness for any emerging new infections,"" Freeman said. If fourth doses are needed, ""health departments would go into the mode of preparing to administer the fourth dose in the way they have done previous doses,"" Freeman said. However, of greater concern among local public health officers is the slow - and declining - pace of people completing their third doses, she said. About 65% of the US population is fully vaccinated with at least their initial series, and about 28% of the population has received a booster dose, according to the CDC, as of Friday. But the ""As time goes on, if there is the necessity of a fourth dose, we're already behind with people getting the third dose,"" Freeman said. ""So all of a sudden, we could have a fairly large segment of the population that is not up to date on vaccines because they're behind by two doses, potentially, and more people could get sick.""","A fourth Covid-19 shot might be recommended this fall, as officials 'continually' look at emerging data"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/26/europe/london-flooding-infrastructure-climate-intl-cmd/index.html,"CNN Cars stranded in streets turned to rivers. Bus passengers rescued by raft. Train stations submerged, sparking travel chaos. The now-familiar scenes of a city inundated by floods played out in London over the weekend, when heavy rainfall put parts of the UK capital underwater. When Climate and infrastructure experts have been warning for years that London, like many other large cities, isn't ready for climate change, with large parts of the city built on a flood plain and a Victorian drainage system that is unable to withstand this kind of intense rain. ""It's deeply concerning that we're seeing hospital emergency departments having to close because they flooded, something certainly needs to be done to make sure that critical infrastructure is not at risk,"" said Liz Stephens, associate professor at the department of geography and environmental science at the University of Reading. According to the Greater London Authority, 17% of London is facing either high or medium risk of flooding, with more than 1 million Londoners live in a flood plain. The city has built a giant flood defense system on the river Thames to protect itself from tidal flooding, but the barriers are of little help when it comes to flash flooding caused by sudden heavy rainfall - the sort that is becoming more common because of rising temperatures. Images from Sunday showed Londoners taken by surprise, wandering through flooded streets. Some even attempting to drive away through the rising water, which officials warn against because of the high likelihood for automobiles to be swept away, or for the drivers to become trapped. The London Fire Brigade said Monday it took over 1,000 emergency calls related to the flooding with crews rescuing people from cars and helping them flee their homes. While these images of people not taking the risk seriously are concerning, Stephens said individuals were hardly to blame here. ""Our ability to map the risk of surface water flooding is not particularly good,"" Stephens said. He noted UK's surface water flood risk maps have not been improved significantly since 2013, even though more precise technology is available and despite the fact that numerous reports have been published that emphasize the increasing risk. On top of that, the way flood risk is monitored and managed in the UK is extremely complicated, with different bodies responsible for different parts of the effort and no single body in charge. The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, issued weather warnings for heavy rainfall and thunderstorms on Sunday, but Stephens said these may not be immediately understood by people. ""I think there was an amber warning which tells you that that there could well be severe impacts, but the amber warning covered a very large area of southeast England,"" said Stephens. ""So really as an individual, what would you do with that kind of information. If you don't know that your property is at risk of flooding, and you've got some very broad scale flood warning, or not even a flood warning, a warning of intense rainfall, then I don't think we can be surprised if people are unprepared for it,"" she said. A report into the impacts of climate change on the UK published last month by the government's independent climate advisory group, the Climate Change Committee, warned the country was not ready, saying that ""adaptation action has failed to keep pace with the worsening reality of climate risk."" ""The risk is always greater in the urban environment because we've got concreted surfaces, but we're also relying on an old drainage infrastructure in London, we're talking about Victorian drains,"" Stephens said. Images like those coming from London on Sunday are becoming worryingly familiar. Just two weeks ago, devastating floods caused by heavy rains swept across large parts of western Europe, leaving more than 200 people dead and thousands homeless. On the other side of the world, much of China's central And while it is not possible to attribute a single event to climate change, heavy rains and floods are becoming more common. As the Earth's atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, which can lead to unprecedented rainfall. It may be that the total average rainfall in an area doesn't change, but extremes are amplified, which can mean longer dry periods or more intense storms. When heavy rain hits after prolonged drought, the soils are less able to absorb the water and the rain is more likely to result in flooding. Urban areas are at higher risk of flash flooding because surfaces are covered with concrete, which means the ground cannot absorb any water. According to the European Environmental Agency, Paris, Thessaloniki, Bucharest and Barcelona among the cities with more than three quarters of their surface area ""sealed,"" meaning they are at higher risk of surface flooding. On top of that, many European cities rely on very old infrastructure, and sewage systems cannot cope with heavier rainfall. ""Summer thunderstorms are not a new occurrence, but it is becoming ever clearer that the worsening impacts of flooding from intense rainfall are having devastating effects here in the UK and across Europe,"" Jess Neumann, a hydrologist at the University of Reading, said in a comment to Science Media Center. ""The severity and frequency of flooding is a stark warning that we are not prepared to deal with climate change.""",Floods in London are the latest sign big cities aren't ready for climate change

But recently, That is how Tucker Carlson presented him, adding Rittenhouse to the new pantheon of right-wing victim-heroes he is building. On both his prime-time show on Fox News and his propaganda documentaries running on the streaming service Fox Nation, Carlson has become one of the most prominent promoters of the narrative now defining conservatism in the US: that right-wing violence is not a problem, that In the interview with Rittenhouse aired Monday night, Carlson emphasized his belief Rittenhouse was a virtuous young man. During the pre-recorded interview, in which Rittenhouse recalled the shootings in polished detail, Carlson not only underscored the righteousness of the teen's actions, but showed He introduced Rittenhouse as ""bright, decent, sincere, dutiful, and hardworking... exactly the kind of person you would want many more of in your country."" During the interview, he joked with Rittenhouse about their shared propensity for gaining weight, while during a break, he said to his audience, ""What a sweet kid."" Shortly after commenting on the shooter's sweetness, Carlson offered his viewers a summary of his Rittenhouse narrative: ""The picture that emerges is of a working-class kid who sincerely believes in America. His community falls apart, and he tries his best to do the right thing, at a time when almost no one else in the community is trying to do the right thing. But he does. And in return for that, the state, under political pressure, throws him in prison."" Carlson has obviously skipped over a key part of the story -- where Rittenhouse killed two people. He does so to underscore his broader message to his audience: It's the same argument Carlson made just a few weeks ago on his conspiratorial documentary, "" He warned a second War on Terror was underway, this time aimed directly at conservatives and Trump supporters. The documentary, which ran on Fox Nation, Though Carlson remains Fox News's biggest star, not everyone on the network is on board with his conspiratorial vision of vigilante conservatism. Earlier this week, Fox News contributors and Never-Trumpers Jonah Goldberg and Steven Hayes quit the network, citing ""Patriot Purge"" as their reason. ""It traffics in all manner of innuendo and conspiracy theories that I think legitimately could lead to violence,"" Goldberg said Their departure comes nearly five years after the network went all in on Donald Trump, replacing Trump skeptics like Megyn Kelly and George Will with some of his most ardent supporters, including Carlson and Laura Ingraham. The network's Trump boosterism was hard to miss, yet so too was giving up lucrative commentator slots. It took ""Patriot Purge"" to finally stir their consciences to the point of departure. The network's leading news anchors, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace, also And that is a key takeaway for the network's embrace of Carlson: though he plays a powerful role in stitching together events like the insurrection and the Rittenhouse trial into a coherent narrative of conservative grievance and virtue, the underlying appeal plays on the preferences of the network's and the party's conservative base.

""We also strongly encourage those who were already eligible - older populations and individuals with underlying medical conditions - to get boosted before the holidays."" Previously, boosters had been authorized for anyone 65 and older who was vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines at least six months ago and for certain adults at high risk of infection or of severe disease. Friday's vote streamlines this, making clear every adult should or may get a booster six months after finishing the first two doses. Recent real-world studies suggested that immunity from Covid-19 vaccines begins to wane and protection against milder and asymptomatic disease, in particular, may drop. Studies have shown that booster doses restore that immunity. Members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices heard safety data from the CDC, from Pfizer and from Moderna that showed the boosters have not caused worrying adverse events. The most common reactions are pain at the injection site, headache and fatigue. ""After critical scientific evaluation, today's unanimous decision carefully considered the current state of the pandemic, the latest vaccine effectiveness data over time, and review of safety data from people who have already received a COVID-19 primary vaccine series and booster,"" Walensky said in a statement. ""Booster shots have demonstrated the ability to safely increase people's protection against infection and severe outcomes and are an important public health tool to strengthen our defenses against the virus as we enter the winter holidays,"" she added. ""Based on the compelling evidence, all adults over 18 should now have equitable access to a COVID-19 booster dose."" The vote comes just in time for people to get boosters before the holidays, the CDC's Dr. Sara Oliver told the meeting. Even if the added immunity given by boosters doesn't last long, she said, it can help. ""Even temporary protection may factor into the benefit risk balance, especially as we approach the winter holidays with increased travel and holiday gatherings,"" Oliver said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN this week that recent data from Israel show that, among people age 60 and older, those who received a booster were less likely to become severely ill than vaccinated people who had not received a booster. Rates of severe disease remained highest among those who weren't vaccinated. The majority of adults had already been eligible to receive boosters, and several states have already moved to open up boosters to all adults. 'Everyone is eligible' Expanding booster eligibility to all adults in the United States may not change the logistics around getting shots into arms. The vaccine supply for boosters is already established in many places. There are no ""extra steps"" on the administration side of the booster rollout that need to happen, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN. ""Looking national, we have enough vaccine. There are lots of places that have appointments. Obviously, that varies a little bit depending upon where you live geographically because there's more demand in some areas than others,"" Casalotti told CNN. ""But that being said, I think the main preparation is on the communication side,"" Casalotti added. ""The communication for the local health care providers and public health departments is that now you don't have to worry about eligibility if someone asks if they need to get a booster. This is the information - everyone is eligible after six months."" Around 32 million people in the United States - about 17% of those who are fully vaccinated - have received a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. About 18 million seniors have received a booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data, accounting for more than half of all booster doses administered and increasing the immune response for more than a third of fully vaccinated seniors. The future of boosters The US is now averaging 94,943 new Covid-19 cases each day, according to Johns Hopkins University - a 31% increase over last week and back to levels last seen more than a month ago. Midwestern states account for more than a third (38%) of new cases. There's concern that winter weather that drives people indoors and holiday gatherings could lead to even more cases. ""We certainly want people to be as well protected as they could possibly be going into the season,"" said Dr. Marci Drees, chief infection prevention officer and hospital epidemiologist for Delaware-based ChristianaCare. Drees is a Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America liaison to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. ""I think we're at the point now where for lots of people who were vaccinated last winter and spring, now would be the time that their protection is waning,"" she said. Once people do receive their Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, it's not clear when they might need another vaccine dose - if ever. ""That certainly is the million-dollar question. We know that the boosters boost people's immunity back up to that 90% to 95% range in the short term. We don't know how long that will last,"" Drees said. ""In some ways, we're forging a new path - and a lot of it is driven by can we get enough immunity in the population so that we can really shut down further transmission,"" Drees said. ""We know that boosters are not going to end the pandemic. They will help and prevent people from getting sick, but we really still need to push on getting first and second doses into people as well.""",CDC recommends Covid-19 boosters for all adults

Here's how it unfolded. Stirrings in Crimea  In the video, a guard at the Kalanchak crossing is seen reacting to something heading towards the Ukrainian border. The guard begins moving back towards the gate, and soon another guard comes into frame. About 25 seconds later, people who had just walked across to Crimea, are seen - suitcases in tow - running back across the border. The lights suddenly go out at the station, and the camera switches to black and white, recording in infrared.  Very soon after, another webcam at the Chongar border crossing - the only other active border crossing station from Crimea - shows lights suddenly turning off, and, minutes later, the camera turns off as well.

He went on to warn: ""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history."" Strikes begin   Several detonations to the east of Kyiv let off massive plumes of gray smoke rising into the night sky. One of the chief targets was the main international airport at Boryspil, which is pummeled by missiles. Video showed a cruise missile hitting a military installation at the airport at Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. Airports were also hit in Kharkiv, Ozerne, Kulbakino, Chuhuiv, Kramatorsk and Chornobaivka. Most of the targets were military bases, but there was clearly substantial damage in and around several cities. In Kharkiv, video emerged of an apartment block that had been damaged by a missile or long-range artillery. Another video showed a rocket embedded in a road. The State Emergency Service reported that six people were trapped in rubble in Nizhyn. Ukraine's interior ministry said ballistic missiles had been used as part of the offensive, while jets were heard over the central city of Zaporizhzhye. The Russians used a wide array of weaponry in their assault, including attack aircraft and helicopters, tanks, long range artillery and missiles.  ""The West is with us,"" he said, and announced martial law across the country.

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/22/health/mis-c-omicron-waiting-for-trouble/index.html,"CNN After the Omicron coronavirus variant made a record number of US children sick in January, children's hospitals across the United States braced for what has come with every other spike in the Covid-19 pandemic: cases of a rare but dangerous condition called MIS-C can follow Covid-19 even some weeks after infection. It can cause parts of the body to become inflamed, and it can affect major organs including the kidneys, brain, lungs and heart.  With the Omicron variant causing so many illnesses, it wasn't clear exactly how many MIS-C cases hospitals could expect or how serious they would be. Research is still underway, but health care providers at many major children's hospitals describe the outcomes as ""a mixed bag."" Cases seem to vary by region The That's a tiny fraction of child Covid cases. More than 12.3 million children have been sick with Covid since the start of the pandemic, according to the The more contagious Different regions of the country are still at different points in the Omicron wave, and it will take some time before scientists have a clearer picture of what the variant has meant for MIS-C cases overall. Most MIS-C cases have not been fatal, but just last week, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported that a 10-year-old from the southeast part of the state died within the past month from MIS-C. Tom Haupt, a respiratory disease epidemiologist with the ""We want to share this information with the CDC with hopes that we can ultimately find out what's causing this and what we could do to further prevent MIS-C,"" Haupt said. There are several MIS-C One thing is certain about MIS-C: ""It always follows the same pattern,"" said Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, Infectious Disease Division chief at Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC. ""It's always two to six weeks after we see the spike from whatever variant it is, and then we're on the lookout for MIS-C. And then, sure enough, it comes."" DeBiasi is one of several scientists still A study published Monday found that during the winter of 2020-21, there was one MIS-C hospitalization for every Covid-19 hospitalization for children 5 to 11 years old. The period studied was long before the Omicron wave hit, but the In Washington, DeBiasi said, her hospital has had 30 Omicron-related MIS-C cases. But each wave has brought with it fewer cases. With the first wave, DeBiasi said, they treated about 100 kids with MIS-C, and with Delta, it was about 60. It's unclear exactly why there have been fewer cases, but she theorizes that vaccines - now authorized for children 5 and older - may have helped. ""The older kids are much less represented among the MIS-C cases now, and that makes sense because they're vaccinated, and there are plenty of studies now showing that vaccination reduces the risk of MIS-C cases just like it reduces the risk of hospitalization and severe disease,"" she said. For example, CDC research Another At Children's Hospital of Colorado, workers are seeing about two or three cases of MIS-C a week, despite what Dr. Pei-Ni Jone described as ""a ton"" of Covid-19 cases. She said some of the MIS-C patients have been vaccinated, but the vast majority are not. ""The MIS-C children, we thought we may see an uptick with Omicron, but we haven't. It's very similar for us with the Delta surge,"" the cardiology specialist said. ""It's really unknown what's driving the MIS-C cases."" At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Dr. Marian Michaels watched the many-fold increase in Covid infections and hospitalizations in her area with deep concern, but the spike in MIS-C cases hasn't come. ""Luckily, in our area we Michaels said she regularly talks with other doctors as a part of a CDC surveillance network, and with Omicron, it's been ""a mixed bag."" Some hospitals have seen a spike in MIS-C cases, but many have seen only a handful. At Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, they too are watching patient numbers closely, but so far, so good. ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles has yet to see a large spike in MIS-C cases following the surge of Omicron cases in the community,"" pediatric cardiologist Dr. Jacqueline Szmuszkovicz of the Heart Institute at Children's Hospital Los Angeles wrote in an email to CNN. In December and January, the hospital treated 22 MIS-C patients. In February, it's been three, with two hospitalized. ""Because we know MIS-C may begin weeks after a child is infected with SARS-CoV-2, we are continuing to be vigilant and waiting to see what the next few weeks bring,"" Szmuszkovicz said. At Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Dr. Ami Patel, a pediatric infectious disease physician, said workers have seen a steady uptick in MIS-C cases since the end of December. But this is ""still relatively lower numbers overall compared to the winter 2020 surge,"" she said. During the Delta surge, the hospital saw ""relatively few"" MIS-C cases. But there has been a spike at Seattle Children's. ""Approximately 15% of the total MIS-C cases we've seen since March 2020 have occurred since mid-December 2021, when Omicron emerged as the main variant. These numbers suggest that MIS-C is increasing with Omicron,"" Dr. Michael Portman, director of research in the Division of Cardiology, wrote in an email to CNN. Texas Children's in Houston saw the peak in Omicron cases January 7, a little later than in other regions, so workers there still don't know what MIS-C case load to expect. There haven't been any ""dramatic increases"" - at least, not yet, according to Dr. Jim Versalovic, pathologist-in-chief at the hospital. Health care providers there have treated more than 280 MIS-C cases The biggest number of MIS-C cases happened between mid-September and mid-October, with the Delta variant. ""We're not quite at that level yet,"" Versalovic said. Instead, they're seeing about one case per day every two to three days. At UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, MIS-C cases seemed to follow much quicker after the spike in Omicron infections than with previous Covid-19 waves. That may not have been unique to the Omicron variant, though, said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, a pediatric infectious disease specialist there. ""I think the reason At Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Dr. Patty Manning said, workers have seen two or three cases of MIS-C a week during Omicron - ""possibly less than what we would expect, given the spike of Covid cases in general that we saw."" She said that could be due to the success of vaccinations, or it could be something specific about Omicron causing fewer MIS-C cases. ""It's unclear at this moment. But we're never wanting to get comfortable,"" Manning said. ""Parents still need to be vigilant."" What to watch for with MIS-C Pediatricians say that if kids have Covid-19, parents should watch for MIS-C symptoms, typically four to six weeks after the infection. They may look like a return of Covid symptoms or totally different. If the symptoms get worse, they need treatment. ""Children have died in the United States because they didn't get to emergency rooms fast enough,"" Versalovic said. Doctors said they have learned a lot about how to treat MIS-C. At Jone's hospital in Colorado, many of the children with MIS-C have not needed to be hospitalized for quite as long as kids were at the beginning of the pandemic. Doctors are much better at recognizing MIS-C, said UPMC's Michaels. ""Treatment right up front has just been critical."" That Because MIS-C can throw a child's immune system into hyperdrive, doctors may also give the child medicine that would suppress their immune system. Those drugs could include steroids or Some children may also need breathing or cardiac support like ventilation or ECMO treatments. ""The long-term follow-up will also be essential to understand how kids do long-term and to understand, from an immune system perspective, what's going on,"" said Michaels, who is involved in several MIS-C studies. ""It will also be important to understand from an immune system standpoint, the ones that still are having an effect long-term. Why is that in that case versus another child who was perfectly healthy before the virus? Why would they not have such a good outcome?"" Most children seem to recover well Jone said that at Colorado Children's, most children get better and do not seem to have lingering effects. ""The first MIS-C children we saw were in May of 2020. So they already had their one follow-up, and all of those kids in 2020 have done very, very well,"" Jone said. A The best approach with MIS-C, doctors said, is for children not to catch Covid-19 in the first place. ""It's a very scary, serious condition,"" Manning said. ""We want to avoid and prevent it at all costs."" That means getting all kids vaccinated if they're eligible. Children are still the least-vaccinated of any eligible age group. There's no vaccine authorized for children under 5, but parents can protect them by making sure every adult around them is fully vaccinated. ""We do need to vaccinate. There is no infection in the world that has ever gone away just because of having herd immunity from natural disease. Measles didn't go away from herd immunity,"" Michaels said. ""Protecting yourself and your loved ones by being immunized is really critical.""","As Omicron cases fall, doctors anxiously await possible surge of dangerous child complication MIS-C"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/19/tech/ant-group-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business Jack Ma's Now it appears to be turning into the kind of highly regulated Chinese bank that it hoped to supplant. Months after the company's blockbuster initial public offering was shelved at the last minute -- a move that appears to have been sparked by Ma's criticism of Chinese regulators -- several media outlets have reported that Ant has agreed with authorities to become a financial holding company. Ant declined to comment on those reports earlier this month, and the details of any potential agreement were not immediately clear. The company did not respond this week to additional questions about any deal with authorities. But the reports suggest that the The company is best known for its Alipay digital payments app, which boasts more than 700 million active users every month. It also has massive interests in online investing, insurance and consumer lending, which have helped it grow into business with assets worth about $635 billion under management. While the company was largely able to grow unchecked over the past decade, the political winds in Beijing are changing. Authorities are growing increasingly mindful of how much influence Ant and its peers have on the country's financial system -- Ant, for example, now commands more than half of the mobile payments market in China -- and are looking for ways to rein them in. ""The Chinese government is moving to regulate these apps with a much heavier hand,"" said Doug Fuller, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong who studies technological development in Asia. ""The aim is not to kill these apps, but the days of unrestrained growth and hopes of displacing traditional banking some day are over."" What it means to be a bank Beijing's tech crackdown has taken many forms over the past several months. Not only did regulators force Ant Group to call off its record-breaking IPO, they also launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba While several loose ends remain, there are some clues as to what Ant's ultimate fate may be, at least. The People's Bank of China last September If Ant is now classified as one of those companies, that could mean it will either have to significantly increase the amount of cash it holds in reserve, or otherwise slash the size of its consumer lending business. Even though the details of Ant's reported agreement have not yet been confirmed, it's easy to see why these new rules might be a problem. Ant held about 2.15 trillion yuan ($333 billion) worth of consumer and small business loans as of last June, according to its IPO prospectus. By comparison, more than 4,000 commercial banks in China held just six times as much in outstanding loans at the time, according to data from Against that huge loan book, Ant held just 16 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) in authorized capital. Beijing, meanwhile, On Saturday, regulators announced even more new rules that could dampen Ant's growth. Online lending companies like Ant will from next year be required to put up at least 30% of the funding for any loan they issue in partnership with a bank according to the Ant will have ""less flexibility and innovative space,"" if it becomes a financial holding company, wrote Ji Shaofeng, the chairman of the China Small and Micro Credit Industry Research Association, in Caixin Global magazine last November after the IPO was pulled. He added that the large amounts of consumer data that Ant has collected through its digital payments services could also now fall under the watchful eye of regulators, potentially presenting further challenges. ""For a tech company that needs constantly [to] innovate, such regulations will pose extremely big pressure,"" he wrote. Longstanding public tensions This is exactly the kind of pressure that ""The Basel Accord is more like a club for the elderly,"" Ma said during a speech in Shanghai last October, his last before Ant's IPO was pulled and he ""What it wants to solve is the problem of the aging financial system that has been in operation for decades,"" Ma said. But while systems like Europe's are complex, he called China's financial system an ""adolescent"" that is better served by innovative tech firms that can bring banking to poor populations and small-time businesses that are otherwise locked out of traditional banks. ""The Basel Accord is about risk control,"" Ma added. ""But China's problem is the opposite. China doesn't have systemic financial risks, because it basically has no financial system."" The tech entrepreneur's choice of words during that speech grew even more colorful -- he criticized China's conventional, state-controlled banks for having a ""pawn shop"" mentality -- and likely spurred Beijing to act swiftly in retaliation. While the Shanghai Stock Exchange was cryptic at the time about the reason for pulling the IPO, saying that Ant's listing had ""major issues,"" the government's response since indicates that its decision was about exercising authority and control. ""China's central planners' primary concern is that the party remains in control of all aspects the economy and business sector,"" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore. ""The rapid growth of Chinese tech giants clearly diminishes the influence of state-owned banks and [other] financial institutions, and that diminishes the power of the Communist Party."" China's tricky balancing act Beijing's calculated crackdown on tech is rooted in economic concern just as much as exercising control. Authorities have long been incredibly wary about whether the influence that tech firms have over the financial sector makes that industry vulnerable to structural risks. If any of the major players failed for some reason, that could wreak havoc on China's economy. ""The idea is to have these firms more firmly under Beijing's control so that they can better serve the state when it comes to building the next generation of [the Internet of Things] or financial infrastructure or rolling out the But it's also a tricky balancing act. While Chinese President Xi Jinping ""There are legitimate concerns about financial risks and anti-competitive behavior that justify greater oversight of the tech giants,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a research note last week. ""But we think a desire to reassert control means that regulators are now swinging too far in the other direction. This threatens to undermine the recent prop to economic growth from rapid productivity gains in the tech sector."" That means Beijing will likely remain careful ""not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,""said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who researches financial tech innovation in China. ""There is widespread recognition of the importance of the super apps for China's innovation ecosystem, hopes for international influence and status, and its economy,"" he added. Fuller of the City University of Hong Kong agreed. If China wants to compete with the West, he said, the country ""has to pursue industrial and technology policies in a more efficient manner."" There is ""a trade-off between promoting state ownership and innovation,"" he added.",Jack Ma's Ant Group was the next big thing. Now it may become just a boring bank

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/24/health/covid-19-thanksgiving-questions-wellness/index.html,"CNN Thursday marks the second Thanksgiving during the coronavirus pandemic. Many grandparents are excitedly planning to see their grandchildren. Friends are dressing their dining tables for turkey and loved ones. Some people have flights booked or road trips scheduled. But in the background, If you have concerns, experts say there are some important questions to ask to help weigh your risk: Will those around you be vaccinated? Have they been tested? Should you open windows when indoors? Results from a Among those planning to gather this Thanksgiving, 30% said the guests will include unvaccinated people and another 17% said they don't know whether guests will be vaccinated or not - which means that almost half of the survey respondents, 47%, could be around unvaccinated people for the holiday. Unvaccinated people are six times more likely to test positive for Covid-19 than those who are vaccinated, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventon, ""Infections among the unvaccinated continue to drive this pandemic, hospitalizations, and deaths - tragically, at a time when we have vaccines that can provide incredible protection,"" Walensky said. ""As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, I want to take a moment to reflect on where we were a year ago. I can remember waiting in great anticipation for the lifesaving vaccines we currently have at our fingertips."" She added, ""We would encourage people who gather to do so safely after they've been fully vaccinated, as we've been saying for months now."" To celebrate safely, here are four questions to ask friends and family ahead of gatherings. Question 1: Have you been vaccinated? Knowing the vaccination status of the people around you can help determine whether you should take certain precautions during holiday gatherings, such as wearing a mask or keeping your distance. Since his family members are fully vaccinated, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health, said that he will be spending the holidays with his family - and it's OK to ditch the masks when everyone is vaccinated. ""That's what I'm going to do with my family,"" Fauci ""That is the safety net - is vaccination,"" Fauci said. ""Get vaccinated and you can enjoy the holidays very easily, and if you're not, please be careful,"" Fauci added. ""Get tested if you need to get tested when you're getting together, but that's not a substitute for getting vaccinated. Get yourself vaccinated and you can continue to enjoy interactions with your family and others."" Someone is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after they receive a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Nearly Question 2: Have you been tested? Some families might be trying to determine whether they should ask guests arriving for Thanksgiving to get tested, especially if the guest has not been vaccinated. ""I think that's a reasonable idea for that extra level of protection. It isn't a firm requirement, but I think if you want to go that extra step, particularly when you're in a region where there's a lot of infection and people are traveling, it is not at all unreasonable to tell people to get a test - one of those rapid tests - 24 hours or so before you go in an indoor setting with people,"" Fauci said Monday ""You can do an antigen test,"" he added. ""It isn't the most sensitive of the tests, but it can tell you when you have enough virus in your nasopharynx to transmit."" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta calls at-home Covid-19 tests ""one of the best tools that we have"" right now to stay safe during the pandemic. ""I don't think that we talk about them enough. I don't think we think about them enough,"" Gupta said in ""Keep in mind, let's say you're vaccinated, but still want to make sure you're not potentially carrying the virus, which can happen. What you can do is you can take a rapid antigen test that can tell you fairly accurately the answer to the question you're really asking: Are you contagious? That's what you really want to know,"" Gupta said, adding that such a test can be bought over-the-counter for about $20. Question 3: Should we crack open a window? Air ventilation is important to think about during large gatherings, Gupta said on his podcast. ""We know that this virus spreads through the air. It's airborne. So, the more that you can get the air moving, the better,"" Gupta said. ""In fact, the way to think about it is think of the virus kind of like smoke. If there is smoke outdoors, you're going to be less likely to breathe it in, right? But indoors, if you have that same smoke, it's going to increase the chances of those particles getting breathed in,"" he added. ""Even cracking a window a little bit can help."" Question 4: Is there anyone at severe risk who needs me to mask up? Even when certain mitigation measures are in place - knowing who's vaccinated and who's not, testing guests and improving air ventilation - it may also be helpful to know who at the Thanksgiving table is at high risk for severe Covid-19 in order to help protect them. Some guests who are at increased risk for severe Covid-19, due to their age or an underlying health condition, may prefer to keep their masks on and for others to wear masks. ""If everybody is generally healthy and they're vaccinated and boosted, probably it's fine for everyone to remove their masks and have a very normal Thanksgiving meal,"" CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, told CNN's John King on Tuesday. ""On the other hand, if there are unvaccinated young children or severely immunocompromised people, you might want to have an additional level of protection - be outdoors, open all the windows indoors or get a rapid test the day of for everyone,"" said Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/20/tech/reliance-jio-ambani-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business  Jio Platforms already has an ecosystem of apps -- Now, Asia's richest man is getting even more ambitious. In the span of a few weeks, he's amassed a Ambani ""definitely [wants Jio Platforms] to be more than just a telecom company. They want to be the next Google or Tencent of India,"" said Wylie Fernyhough, an analyst with PitchBook. The ""ultimate goal,"" according to Building a new kind of tech giant Under Ambani's leadership, Reliance Industries has grown from an oil and energy company into a sprawling conglomerate that includes retail shops, a mobile and broadband carrier, digital platforms and more. But to take his plans to the next level, Ambani needed buy-in from Silicon Valley -- hence, his $5.7 billion partnership with Facebook and its global messaging service WhatsApp. When the deal was announced last month, the scale of his ambition was clear. ""This winning recipe will be extended to serve other key stakeholders of Indian society,"" Ambani said. ""Our kisans [small agricultural workers]. Our small and medium enterprises. Our students and teachers. Our healthcare providers."" The deal, which is still awaiting regulatory approval, signaled that Ambani and Facebook are trying to create ""some sort of platform where you can do everything from mobile banking, to messaging, to your social media, to everything basically built into just one platform,"" according to Fernyhough. In other words, a version of Tencent's wildly popular WeChat service in China. Unlike Tencent, though, Jio Platforms also has a massive mobile network that it can rely on to build a base of customers. ""We have seen the e-commerce, content, cloud, tech companies replacing traditional telcos,"" said Pathak. He pointed to Rakuten ""Eventually you can't just sell data, right, it will be much more on top of it,"" he said. Facebook has pushed back on the idea that it is helping Ambani build a ""super app"" by noting that the two companies will continue to operate separately in India with their own services. Instead, the two companies are providing ""enabling blocks for small businesses to come online, that then allows many other companies to ride on that,"" Ajit Mohan, vice president and managing director of Facebook for India, told CNN Business. But even that level of collaboration gives Ambani a great deal of clout in India, allowing him to find new customers by offering online services and digital tools that Indians are clamoring for. Grocery as a step toward domination Online grocery shopping is the partnership's first target. India's online grocery market is small by comparison, worth around $3 billion this year, according to the research firm Forrester. But the firm said that number is growing fast, as the pandemic is quickly changing people's shopping habits. When JioMart launched late last year, it set a goal of convincing 30 million small shops to do business on the platform. The Covid-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdown in India have accelerated the need to get kiranas online fast. WhatsApp will be instrumental in making that happen, because more than 400 million Indians already use it as their main messaging app, and often text businesses directly to buy goods or ask about products and services. JioMart and WhatsApp are ""going to make life complicated for Amazon That was the experience of Sambit Mohanty, a 40-year-old sales and marketing executive. Worried about his elderly parents, Mohanty ordered basic essentials like tea leaves and soup for them on Amazon. But delivery took 10 days. He was also unable to buy toys for his daughter on Amazon, because it stopped taking orders for non-essential items. Now Mohanty said he's turning back to local grocers -- many of which do business on WhatsApp. ""It only takes a notice from the government, and Amazon ... puts a [notice] online saying that they won't deliver,"" he said. ""But the local kirana stores are always available."" There are some disadvantages to relying on those shops: If JioMart can Pathak, of Counterpoint Research, said it will be easier to convince the mom and pop shops to join JioMart because WhatsApp is involved, so they Good for Ambani's bottom line The Shortly after the Facebook deal was announced, Jio Platforms revealed three more big investments: $750 million from Silver Lake, $1.5 billion from Vista and $870 million from General Atlantic. In all, Ambani secured about $9 billion in less than four weeks. Analysts say Ambani is under pressure to pay off debt, offset the massive declines he is experiencing in oil and other sectors, and prove the value of Jio Platforms. The billionaire said at a shareholders meeting last year that he wants Reliance Industries to become a ""zero net debt company"" by March 2021. As of March 2020, Reliance had about $44 billion of debt on its books. ""Reliance also needs technology to shift from a petroleum and trading company to [a] software company,"" said Meena, of Forrester. The pandemic has badly dented the oil business. Global oil demand has cratered because of sharp declines in transport, industrial and commercial activity. There is likely more money coming Ambani's way. Investors see the potential ""for the Indian version of WeChat, and how many hundreds of billions of dollars that could be worth one day,"" Pitchbook's Fernyhough said. ""Being able to kind of get in on the ground floor of that is something that is really interesting to a lot of people."" Last month, Reliance Industries said it is ahead of schedule and will achieve its zero debt target by the end of the year. ",How Asia's richest man is trying to build the next global tech giant

Several new reports published recently Researchers from the University of Arizona found antibodies that protect against infection can last for at least five to seven months after a Covid-19 infection. With the pandemic under a year old, it will likely take time before scientists can get a clear picture of immunity. ""That said, we know that people who were infected with the first SARS coronavirus, which is the most similar virus to SARS-CoV-2, are still seeing immunity 17 years after infection. If SARS-CoV-2 is anything like the first one, we expect antibodies to last at least two years, and it would be unlikely for anything much shorter,"" Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunobiologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, previously told CNN. Other studies, one out of Massachusetts and the other out of Canada, supported the idea of long-lasting immunity. That suggests ""that if a vaccine is properly designed, it has the potential to induce a durable antibody response that can help protect the vaccinated person against the virus that causes COVID-19,"" Jennifer Gommerman, professor of immunology at the University of Toronto, said What's unclear is how second infections could impact any Covid-19 vaccine. The Nevada man experienced more critical symptoms during his second infection while the Hong Kong man did not have any obvious symptoms during his reinfection. ""The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application,"" according to the authors of a  There's something else researchers have begun to notice: People who have a tougher bout with the illness tend to have a stronger immune response.

""But almost everyone who has moderate to severe disease has antibodies."" Bhattacharya, from Arizona, echoed that finding.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/24/health/covid-19-antibodies-coronavirus-reinfection-study-wellness/index.html,"CNN There's new evidence that connects testing positive for Covid-19 antibodies from a prior infection with a significantly lower risk of becoming infected again in the future. A study, published in the journal ""The results from the study are basically a 10-fold reduction, but I would have caveats around that. In other words, it could be an overestimate of the reduction. It could be an underestimate of the reduction,"" said Dr. Douglas Lowy, principal deputy director of the ""To me, the big message is - there's a reduction,"" he said. ""The main takeaway is that being antibody positive after natural infection is associated with partial protection against a new infection."" Lowy added that people who have recovered from Covid-19 should still get vaccinated when it is their turn. The researchers - from the National Cancer Institute and the companies LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics, Aetion Inc. and HealthVerity - examined data on more than 3.2 million people in the United States who had completed a Covid-19 antibody test last year between January and August. Among those tested, 11.6% tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies and 88.3% tested negative. In follow-up data, the researchers found that only 0.3% of those who tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies ended up testing positive for coronavirus infection later, beyond 90 days. Whereas, 3% of those with negative Covid-19 antibody test results were later diagnosed with coronavirus infection during that same time period. Overall, the study is observational and it suggests there is an association between positive Covid-19 antibody test results and a lower risk of infection some 90 days later - but more research is needed to determine a causal relationship and for how long protection from antibodies may last. Lowy said that more research is also needed to determine the risk of reinfection from one of the emerging coronavirus variants. ""Now that there are these variants of concern, what are the implications there? The short answer is we don't know,"" Lowy said. He also emphasized that people who have tested positive for antibodies should still get vaccinated against Covid-19. It's already known that most patients who recover from Covid-19 have antibodies and reinfection appears to be rare so far - but it is still unclear for ""how long antibody protection will last because of natural infection,"" Dr. Mitchell Katz of the NYC Health + Hospitals health care system wrote in an editorial that published alongside the new study in JAMA Internal Medicine.

So far, Evergrande has failed to publicly address two interest payments on bonds over the past week. That's fueling speculation over Here's what you need to know about Evergrande, and how it got to where it is now. What is Evergrande? Evergrande is one of China's largest real estate developers. The company is part of the Listed in The group was founded by Chinese billionaire Xu Jiayin, also known as Hui Ka Yan in Cantonese, who was Evergrande made its name in residential property -- it Outside housing, the group has invested in In 2010, the company Guangzhou Evergrande continues to reach for new records: It's currently working on creating the Evergrande also caters to tourists through its theme park division, Evergrande Fairyland. Its claim to fame is a massive undertaking called The project includes an artificial island with malls, museums and amusement parks. According to the group's most recent How did it run into trouble? In recent years, Evergrande's debts ballooned as it borrowed to finance its various pursuits. The group has gained infamy for becoming China's most indebted developer, with more than $300 billion worth of liabilities. Over the last few weeks, it's warned investors of cash flow issues, saying that it could default if it's unable to raise money quickly. That warning was In some ways, the company's aggressive ambitions are what landed it in hot water, according to experts. The group ""strayed far from its core business, which is part of how it got into this mess,"" said Mattie Bekink, China director of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Goldman Sachs analysts say the company's structure has also made it ""difficult to ascertain a more precise picture of [its] recovery."" In a But the group's struggles are also emblematic of underlying risks in China. ""The story of Evergrande is the story of the deep [and] structural challenges to China's economy related to debt,"" said Bekink. The issue isn't entirely new. Last year, a slew of Chinese state-owned companies And in 2018, billionaire Wang Jianlin was forced to In a recent note, ""The root of Evergrande's troubles -- and those of other highly-leveraged developers -- is that residential property demand in China is entering an era of sustained decline,"" he wrote. ""Evergrande's ongoing collapse has focused attention on the impact a wave of property developer defaults would have on China's growth."" How is it trying to move forward? The company somewhat placated investors last week after The amount of interest it owed on the bond is about 232 million yuan ($36 million), according to data from Refinitiv. But many questions still remain unanswered. Evergrande did not elaborate on the terms of the payment, and interest worth $83.5 million on a dollar-denominated bond also fell due last Thursday. That deadline came and went without an update from the company. The firm also But instead of going toward its outstanding bond interest payments, the money will likely be used to settle its debts with that lender, Shengjing Bank. The conglomerate said it would still hang on to a 14.75% stake after the deal closes. Evergrande faced another bond interest payment of nearly $50 million Wednesday, though as of noon local time on Thursday it had stayed silent on the status of that debt. On September 14, Evergrande announced that it had brought on financial advisers to help assess the situation. While those firms are tasked with exploring ""all feasible solutions"" as quickly as possible, Evergrande has cautioned that nothing is guaranteed. So far, the conglomerate has struggled to stem the bleeding, and has failed to find buyers for parts of its electric vehicle and property services businesses. As of that filing, it had made ""no material progress"" in its search for investors, and ""it is uncertain as to whether the group will be able to consummate any such sale,"" it said. The electric car company has addressed how those challenges have trickled down, with a On top of that, the group has been trying to sell off its office tower in Hong Kong, which it bought for about $1.6 billion in 2015. But that has ""not been completed within the expected timetable,"" it said in mid-September. How are investors reacting? Evergrande's problems spilled onto the streets this month But shareholders have been wary for months: The stock has shed nearly 85% of its value this year. Earlier this month, Fitch and Moody's Investors Services both downgraded Evergrande's credit ratings, citing its liquidity issues. ""We view a default of some kind as probable,"" Fitch wrote in a Fitch doubled down on that view with a further downgrade on Tuesday, saying that the group was ""likely to have missed [an] interest payment on its senior unsecured notes."" The situation also appears to be spooking investors in China more broadly, at a time when they're already reeling from Beijing's ""In our opinion, how Evergrande credit stresses will be resolved will drive market sentiment,"" Goldman Sachs analysts What could happen next? The Chinese government appears to be starting to intervene. Over the past few days, the People's Bank of China has injected some cash into the financial system, to help settle nerves. On Tuesday alone, it added 100 billion yuan (approximately $15.5 billion), saying it was to keep liquidity going. In a statement this week, the central bank also vowed to ""maintain the healthy development of the real estate market, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of housing consumers."" It doubled down on that message Wednesday in a meeting jointly held with regulators, where authorities emphasized the need to not use ""real estate as a short-term [tool for] economic stimulus,"" according to a central bank Officials also directed the financial sector to focus on stabilizing land and housing prices, adding that institutions should work with ""local governments to jointly maintain the steady and healthy development of the real estate market."" Authorities are clearly watching closely, while attempting to project calm. This month, Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for China's National Bureau of Statistics, acknowledged the difficulties of ""some large real estate companies,"" according to state media. Without naming Evergrande directly, Fu said that China's real estate market had remained stable this year but the impact of recent events ""on the development of the whole industry needs to be observed."" Earlier this month, According to the report, officials in Evergrande's home province of Guangdong have already rejected a bailout request from its founder. Guangdong authorities and Evergrande did not respond to a request for comment. Beijing has few good choices. It will want to protect the thousands of people who have bought unfinished apartments, as well as construction workers, suppliers and small investors. In China, real estate, and its related industries, account for as much as 20% of the urban workforce, according to Christina Zhu, an economist at Moody's Analytics. Authorities will also likely aim to limit the risk of other real estate firms going under. But at the same time, they have long been trying to rein in excessive borrowing by developers -- and won't want to dilute that message. Even with cash infusions, some suggest it may already be too late to save the company. Evergrande's financial problems have been widely dubbed by Chinese media as ""a huge black hole,"" implying that no amount of money can resolve the issue. ""China has really been trying to clean up its bad corporate debt for years. And although they made some progress before the pandemic, the task often seems interminable, and that's what you're certainly seeing here,"" said Bekink.

That study, published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, examined vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 hospitalizations and emergency department and urgent care visits among adults in the United States who were either fully vaccinated with two doses or received a third dose of vaccine as a booster. The data included 241,204 emergency department or urgent care visits and 93,408 hospitalizations across 10 states between August 26 and January 22. The data showed that vaccine effectiveness against emergency department visits and hospitalizations was higher after the third dose than after the second dose but waned over time. With the Omicron variant dominant in the United States, vaccine effectiveness was 87% against Covid-19 emergency department or urgent care visits and 91% against hospitalizations in the two months after a third dose. It fell to 66% and 78%, respectively, by the fourth month, the data showed. After just two doses of vaccine, when the Omicron variant was predominant, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations declined from 71% in the two months after vaccination to 54% by at least five months, the study found. The data also showed vaccine effectiveness dropping while the Delta variant was dominant. Among recipients of three doses during the time Delta was dominant, vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19-associated hospitalizations declined from 96% within two months of vaccination to 76% at least months later. However, the researchers noted that the latter estimate could be imprecise because few data were available on people vaccinated for at least four months after a third dose during the time Delta was predominant. Overall, ""these findings underscore the importance of receiving a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to prevent both COVID-19-associated ED/UC encounters and COVID-19 hospitalizations among adults,"" researchers at the CDC and other institutions across the United States wrote in the new study. The other CDC study analyzed The study found that booster doses of the coronavirus vaccines remain safe, and those who received the same type of vaccine for all of their vaccinations tended to have fewer reactions after the booster dose than after their second dose. ""Vaccination providers should educate patients that local and systemic reactions are expected following a homologous COVID-19 mRNA vaccine booster; however, these reactions are less common than those following the second primary series dose,"" wrote the researchers, from the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration.","Covid-19 vaccine booster effectiveness wanes after four months but still offers protection, study finds"

But the current pace - about 95,000 new Covid-19 cases each day - is up 9% from just a week ago. Cases dropped off quickly at the tail end of the summer surge, but More than a third of new cases are in Midwestern states, with Michigan reporting more cases per capita than any other state and Minnesota not far behind. But the trend is nationwide; more than half of states saw cases rise at least 10% over the past week, JHU data shows. The latest uptick in cases is ""not unexpected,"" as people spend more time inside during the cold-weather season and as immunity wanes, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We have a lot of virus circulating around,"" Fauci said. With millions still unvaccinated, that ""results in the dynamic of virus in the community that not only is dangerous and makes people who are unvaccinated vulnerable, but it also spills over into the vaccinated people because no vaccine is 100% effective,"" he said. Unvaccinated people continue to drive new infections People who are still unvaccinated are ""the major source"" of coronavirus infections in US communities right now, Fauci said Sunday on ""ABC This Week."" Nearly 60% of the US population is fully vaccinated, but about 81 million people - more than a quarter of those eligible - have not yet received their first dose, a CNN analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. Unvaccinated people face a higher risk of testing positive for Covid-19 than fully vaccinated people do, and the gap is even greater in terms of risk of hospitalization or death. Unvaccinated people were six times more likely than fully vaccinated people to test positive for Covid-19 and 14 times more likely to die of Covid-19, according to the latest CDC data. Fully vaccinated families ""Get vaccinated and you can enjoy the holidays very easily. And if you're not, please be careful,"" he said.

Three-quarters of beds in intensive care units are full - more than one in seven of them for Covid-19 patients. And more than 1,100 people are dying of Covid-19 each day, according to JHU data.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/23/china/china-flood-climate-change-mic-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN As record heat waves hit western North America and deadly floods swept Germany, the growing risks associated with climate change have grabbed headlines, and prompted widespread discussions in the West. Scientists have been warning for years that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent -- and the latest catastrophes are seen as a timely reminder the threat could hit much closer to home than some might think. But this week, with much of China's central Henan province devastated by record rains, there was little reference to  the broader climate crisis among Chinese officials, scientists or state media. The silence is all the more conspicuous given how much Chinese authorities have emphasized the extremeness and rarity of the weather. At one point, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou was pelted by nearly 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in an hour. In just three days, it had 24 inches (61 centimeters) -- or nearly a year's worth -- of rainfall, according to the Zhengzhou meteorological station. Zhengzhou's weather station called it a ""once in a thousand years"" downpour. Henan's water resources department went a step further, claiming rain levels recorded at some stations could only be seen ""once every 5,000 years."" But on Thursday, state-run newspaper the Global Times Liu Junyan, climate and energy project leader for Greenpeace East Asia, said without the impact of climate change, ""it is very difficult to imagine such extreme rainfall would occur in an inland city like Zhengzhou."" But she said it is rare for Chinese weather and climate authorities to acknowledge a potential climate change connection in the aftermath of extreme occurrences, because such analysis requires more research and data. ""Out of caution, they basically avoid talking about it,"" she said. Such associations are also seldom reported by state media, she added. That stands in stark contrast to how climate scientists and the media have responded in the West. While full analysis is needed to confirm to what degree changes to the earth's climate have affected specific extreme weather events, many experts agree the trend is clear. Scientists at the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization (WMO), for example, conducted a rapid attribution analysis, which found the western North America heat waves would have been "" It is not that Chinese leaders do not admit climate change is real. On the contrary, President Xi Jinping wants China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, to become a global leader on the climate crisis. Last year, he pledged to hit domestic peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, earning international praise. In the official narrative, climate change is often Chinese authorities are also wary that climate activism popular among young people in the West could spread to China. Last September, 17-year-old Ou Hongyi, known as the Greta Thunberg of China, was detained and questioned for hours by police when she joined the Global Climate Strike in Shanghai, an international event that attracted thousands of protesters at more than 3,500 locations worldwide. That has made it difficult for the Chinese public to realize how they are personally related to the climate crisis, Liu said. Like some in the West, Chinese people tend to perceive the dangers of climate change as something remote -- threatening only the melting ice caps in the Arctic or low-lying islands in the tropics. And although emission cuts and green reforms are often mentioned in state media and classrooms, many treat them as just another state policy for local governments to follow. ""For many, climate change is more of an issue about politics, about economic gains and costs, and international collaboration,"" Liu said. But as the devastation in Henan shows, many Chinese cities are not prepared to deal with the In the 18 hours before the evening rush on Tuesday, Zhengzhou's weather station issued five consecutive red alerts for torrential rain. According to guidance from the China Meteorological Administration, the alert should have prompted authorities to halt gatherings, suspend classes and businesses -- advice Zhengzhou authorities apparently failed to heed. As the deaths of 12 passengers trapped on a flooded subway gripped the nation, some have questioned why authorities didn't shut down it down earlier to avoid casualties. The situation could be worse in smaller towns and villages around Zhengzhou with far less contingency planning, rescue resources and media exposure, Liu said. The last time Henan saw similarly intense downpours was nearly half a century ago. In 1975, a super typhoon dumped huge amounts of rain onto the province -- one village at the center of the storm saw 63 inches (160 centimeters) of rain in three days. Overflowing rivers burst 62 dams, killing more than 26,000 people by the official count, though other estimates were several times higher. While the connection between climate change and extreme weather in China might not have received much official mention, it doesn't mean Chinese scientists haven't been studying the issue. A On Chinese social media, too, ""In Henan, the (disaster) unfolded too quickly in such a short time,"" she wrote. ""But in other places, it's like boiling a frog in warm water -- it might not cause any immediate life threatening danger, but in the long run, I reckon it'll also affect how we live and work.""

In a separate news conference, however, police said they had been arrested under articles 9 and 10 of the law -- which allow the government to regulate the internet, the media, and other communications to prevent ""terrorist activities"" and to ""promote national security education in schools."" CNN has reached out to police, but was not offered an explanation as to the discrepancies in the statements. In the news conference, police said the storylines depicted in the children's books ""beautify illegal acts of political violence,"" and urged parents to get rid of books that would ""harm the mind of the next generation."" Police denied accusations the law was being used as a ""legal trap"" for publishers or media outlets -- but the arrests are deepening fears of censorship nevertheless. In the past year, authorities have ordered schools to ban certain textbooks that may violate the law, blocked websites on national security grounds, and revised film censorship guidelines to abide by the law. Around Asia Chinese tech IPOs on Wall Street could come to a grinding halt A wave of Chinese firms have reportedly backed off of plans to go public in the United States. Tough US laws requiring audits for foreign companies and a growing crackdown by Beijing has made it increasingly tough for Chinese tech companies to approach Wall Street. Since February, shares of overseas-listed Chinese tech firms have lost a staggering $1 trillion in value, marking one of the biggest sell-offs of all time, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. And, after a disastrous IPO by ride-hailing giant Didi, TikTok owner Bytedance, social e-commerce platform Xiaohongshu, fitness app Keep and medical data company LinkDoc Technology have all either shelved or scrapped plans to list in New York, according to media reports. It ""may very well be"" the end -- at least temporarily -- to US listings for Chinese companies, according to Doug Guthrie, a professor and director of China Initiatives at Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management. He added that a ""serious pause"" on such listings could be in effect until US-China relations improve. There are still ways for Chinese companies to tap overseas investment even if the US is no longer an option. They can go to Hong Kong, for example, which also has a diverse pool of international investors and a regulatory regime that meets international standards. But the US market still has an irreplaceable role, as it's bigger than any other financial market in the world, has a greater turnover in stocks and places a higher value on company earnings. That means a company listing in America may find it easier to achieve a higher valuation and sell more shares.

Made by startup Startups from around the world are coming to the purpose-built track that recreates an urban environment over 5 acres at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. The roads look like any other in the city, with stop lights, crosswalks and traffic signs. There's even a rain simulator. It's all part of an effort to test how autonomous vehicles cope with all those elements. Dillip Limbu, MooVita's CEO, said the quirky design of the company's car, the MooAV, is intentional. ""In order for the public to know that this is different to conventional cars, it needs to be noticeably different on first impressions, and stand out in comparison to other cars,"" he told CNN. Projects like Nanyang's test track have helped Singapore become a hub for the development of self-driving vehicles. That role fits with the city-state's broader push to encourage the growth of its tech sector and tackle some of the challenges it faces at the same time. ""Singapore is aging more rapidly and [at] a faster rate than anywhere else in the world, and so we have a situation where, in order to provide mobility for seniors, it would be really advantageous to have such technology available,"" said Subodh Mhaisalkar, the professor in charge of Nanyang's Energy Research Institute, which carries out autonomous vehicle research. The institute's self-driving work focuses on groups like the elderly or disabled who they believe would be the first to benefit from the technology.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/16/health/states-allow-booster-shots-for-all-adults-wellness/index.html,"CNN Some states are not waiting. At least five so far - So far, the federal health agencies have only given the green light for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna boosters to be administered to adults ages 65 and older or any adults at high risk of severe Covid-19 or who live or work in long-term care settings or high-risk settings who completed their second dose at least six months ago. All adults who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago are eligible for boosters. But that could soon change. As the US waits for the FDA to authorize boosters for all adults, frustration has grown within some communities and among some public health experts who argue there is an urgent need to move quickly to get boosters into more arms. For some states, ""the reason they've gone ahead and done this is they are really concerned about experiencing another wave in their state of transmissions and we have seen in some states an uptick in Covid-19 cases. Unfortunately, a lot of those are driven by those who are not vaccinated, but there are some breakthrough infections among those who are vaccinated,"" Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, told CNN on Tuesday. ""From a public perception, there are some that really do want the boosters. They are worried about breakthrough transmission,"" Tewarson said. ""So, I think this is where governors - at least some governors - are trying to address the tension here of some in the public who really want to take that extra step even though we don't know yet what all the data tells us."" 'Frustrated' and waiting Overall, some states have moved forward in deciding to expand eligibility for boosters, Tewarson said, adding that the move is similar to how early on in the pandemic some states required masks in public spaces even though there was no federal mask policy. Most of the states that have expanded eligibility for booster doses to all adults have seen recent upticks in Covid-19 case numbers and hospitalizations - and state public health authorities have the ""ultimate decision"" on responding to such public health matters, Dr. Mark McClellan, director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy at Duke University and a former FDA commissioner, told CNN on Tuesday. Those increases in cases are occurring as the winter season approaches. ""I think that assessment of being under higher risk now is what's driving some of those decisions,"" McClellan said. ""But I do know that all the states are waiting for further guidance from the FDA and the CDC based on any new evidence that's come in,"" he said. ""I would expect FDA to go ahead this time with authorizing boosters more broadly and then CDC confirming that and then you'll see kind of all the states go further."" In Colorado for instance, about 81% of people hospitalized for Covid-19 are unvaccinated but for the 19% who are vaccinated, booster doses can help bring their case numbers down, ""I've been very frustrated with the convoluted messaging out of the CDC and the FDA,"" Polis told Brennan. ""Everybody should get the booster after six months. The data is incredibly clear that it increases your personal protection level - that's why my parents got it, I got it, my family members got it,"" Polis said. ""But it also can help improve the epidemiological state of a particular state or of the entire country, because you have folks that are ready to roll up their sleeves and add that extra protection, to go from 70% or 80% protection back to that 90% to 95% level of protection, which can really have an impact in preventing the spread of the virus."" His state announced last week that there is a "" FDA authorization could come any time Pfizer and BioNTech were the first vaccine makers to request expansion of eligibility for their Covid-19 booster shot to all adults. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech asked the FDA to amend the emergency use authorization for their vaccine so that all adults are eligible for a booster shot. Currently, boosters are authorized for a more limited group of adults. When such requests are made to change an emergency use authorization, typically the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) will meet to discuss the request and make a recommendation about how the FDA should proceed. But this time, the FDA does not plan to convene VRBPAC to discuss expanding eligibility for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 booster shots, FDA spokesperson Alison Hunt confirmed to CNN in an email Tuesday. The FDA concluded that Pfizer/BioNTech's request does not raise questions that would require additional discussion by the advisory committee, which is made up of outside experts. Without a committee meeting, the FDA's authorization decision could come any time. ""While the FDA cannot predict how long its evaluation of the data and information will take, the agency will review the request as expeditiously as possible,"" Hunt noted. A separate panel of CDC vaccine advisers is scheduled to meet Friday to discuss expanding booster eligibility for Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine, CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said Tuesday. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices typically meets only once a vaccine has been authorized by the FDA - a further sign that the FDA authorization could come any time this week. Reviewing Pfizer's request to authorize Covid-19 booster shots for all adults is ""highest priority"" for the FDA, the agency's top vaccines official told CNN on Monday. ""At this time, the review of the expanded Booster request has highest priority at the Center for Biologics Evaluation at FDA,"" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA'S Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told CNN in an email. ""Although we can't give an exact date for the completion of this process, we are working on reviewing the request and evaluating the data with all due speed given the current public health emergency,"" Marks wrote. ""FDA is moving as rapidly as possible to address recently submitted information related to expanding the population of individuals eligible for boosters,"" he added. ""As is apparent from the previous public discussions of boosters, the thinking of experts in this area related to supporting boosters for all individuals over age 18 years has evolved very rapidly."" Recent studies suggest that while vaccination still provides strong protection against severe disease and death months later, immunity may begin to wane and protection against milder and asymptomatic disease may drop over time. Studies also show that booster doses restore that immunity. Public health officials in the Biden administration are on the ""same page"" when it comes to the benefits of booster shots, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said Sunday. ""The reality is that there is much more agreement here than I think people appreciate,"" said Murthy Murthy said that Fauci, Walensky and he all believe that vaccine immunity against Covid-19 can wane over time and they prefer the FDA and CDC to weigh in on both the efficacy and safety of booster shots. ""While we have now millions of people eligible for booster shots, we're going through an FDA process and we'll go through a CDC process to see if that eligibility should be widened,"" Murthy said. ""But the bottom line is all of us are on the same page about the strong protection that vaccines afford and we know that where boosters are indicated that they will be helpful to extending people's protection against Covid-19.""","Some 'frustrated' states don't wait for FDA, expand Covid-19 vaccine booster eligibility to all adults"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/19/politics/biden-administration-booster-shots-covid-19/index.html,"CNN  There has been deep frustration inside the administration over the complicated messaging surrounding booster shots, with several officials conceding to CNN that the restrictions on who should get one and when have only spurred confusion when it was clear immunity wanes for all age groups. They hope that will end now that the US Food and Drug Administration has expanded authorization for ""It will be easier to communicate the urgency and availability to all populations, including the most vulnerable, by simplifying this and making everyone eligible,"" one senior health official told CNN. ""Finally, they got there,"" another official added. Once the decisions were made, the message will be: If you are fully vaccinated, you still need a booster shot. As cases of Covid surge in parts of Europe, US officials have been anxiously awaiting a similar uptick as temperatures drop in many parts of the country. Rates in the US have increased in recent days, causing fresh concern that a seasonal spike is imminent. Some of President Joe Biden's advisers have viewed the spike of cases in Europe as further reason to press forward with a plan to offer boosters to all adults, seeing it as getting ahead of what is likely to come in the United States. While the prospect of a winter surge has long been included in the administration's Covid planning, some advisers feel boosters could help mitigate the effects. While publicly the White House said it was waiting for the process to proceed to expand boosters to all adults, privately some on The latest states to get ahead of the federal regulators were Utah and Massachusetts, following several others who determined all adults should get third shots. ""CDC speaks Latin. I can't figure out who's eligible, who's not eligible. If you smoked while you were in high school, back in the 1970s, you're eligible,"" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said at a news conference on Thursday, urging all adults to get a booster if they meet the timing requirement. ""I think if you haven't been vaccinated in more than six months, now's the time to get the booster."" A new surge of Covid cases around the winter holidays would further disrupt a festive season already complicated by high gas prices and supply chain issues. Biden has received personal assurances from the CEOs of major shippers and box store retailers that they will be able to operate and fully stock their shelves this year. But the lingering effects of the pandemic will still be felt, from mask requirements on planes to higher prices for food to shortages of certain goods. Biden and his team are loathe to recommend against indoor holiday gatherings for another year, mindful that Americans are growing increasingly exhausted from pandemic-related restrictions. So, too, are Biden and his team mindful of not signaling an end to the pandemic after prematurely declaring ""freedom from the virus"" over the summer. A subsequent surge due to the highly contagious Delta variant caused a return of mask requirements and closures, and led many Americans to sour on how Biden was handling the crisis. Once a bright spot in his poll numbers, more Americans now disapprove of Biden's handling of the pandemic (49%) than approve (47%), according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week. The downward trajectory maps closely with the period when cases began rising again over the summer after it seemed to many the pandemic had ended. And it mimics an overall political weakening for Biden, whose approval rating stands at 44%, according to a CNN poll of polls. Biden's political advisers believe ending the Covid pandemic - and, by extension, easing its associated economic pressures - is the most central imperative to improving the President's standing.",Frustrated Biden officials are hoping to simplify the message on Covid-19 boosters
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/22/business/china-private-sector-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN Business President Xi Jinping has sent a message to China's The ruling Chinese The private sector needs ""politically sensible people,"" the directive said, who will ""firmly listen to the party and follow the party."" The message comes as the world's second-largest economy The message was remarkable for its candor and zeal. In the past, Beijing had taken a more tactful approach when it wants to exercise control over companies beyond the state sector -- like in 2018 when Xi offered the private sector tax breaks, financial assistance, and a personal vow of support to quell any fears that it was falling out of political favor. And while it's not yet clear what practical effect the latest directive will have on private enterprise in China, one of Xi's catchphrases has been ""the party exercises overall leadership over all endeavors across the country."" The directive indicates that the Chinese leader wants to take more overt measures to spell out the importance of the Communist Party's philosophies. That could mean requiring private companies to take public stances on major political or foreign affairs, such as any territorial disputes that China is involved in. Even powerful tycoons with strong ties to the Communist Party aren't immune from punishment. On Tuesday, the retired real estate mogul Ren Zhiqiang The 'United Front' The private sector is a vital part of China's economy. More than 30 million private businesses contribute over 60% of the country's GDP. The taxes they pay account for more than half of government revenue, and they employ more than 80% of China's workers. The document explicitly called for the private sector to become part of the ""United Front,"" a coalition of individuals and organizations tasked with carrying out the party's agenda and creating alliances among those with similar philosophies. The network's origins can be traced back nearly a century, and it was once credited by Chairman Mao Zedong as a ""magic weapon"" that helped the Communist Party triumph over its enemies. China has not publicly released documents emphasizing the importance of aligning the private sector with the United Front since the late 1970s, when the country embarked on a decades-long path toward economic reform meant to stabilize the country after the Cultural Revolution. But in some ways, this kind of messaging isn't entirely surprising, according to Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute in London. While China's economy has managed to avert recession this year, the coronavirus pandemic has still wiped out much of its growth. Chinese politicians have in the past expressed concern that China is also faces rising hostility from Western powers, noted Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Centre for China Studies, Chinese University of Hong Kong. The feud between Washington and Beijing has hurt the fortunes of many Chinese businesses, from TikTok owner ByteDance to tech firm Huawei. ""Xi wants the whole nation to act as one because the country is going though unprecedented challenges,"" Lam said. ""Under the growing sense of crisis, Xi wants everybody in China to unite under the leadership of the party and speak the same voice."" Private sector on the defense As extraordinary as Following Xi's government blamed the turmoil partly on high-flying financial tycoons, and since then Beijing has tightened the rules that govern the sector. Regulators have curbed excessive corporate borrowing and made it harder for money to leave China. As that campaign was taking off around 2017, ""The economy is therefore not an exception,"" Even more concerning, a handful of major companies had begun taking on For example, in 2018 Chinese regulators Earlier this year, the massive conglomerate HNA Group also fell under government management. The company had spent $40 billion on investments in Hilton Even some of China's most successful private companies have been subject to government action. Last year, for example, That move may have been a message from the government to private companies: ""Move closer [to us] and listen,"" Ronald Wan, chief executive for Partners Capital International in Hong Kong, told CNN Business at the time. The private sector Revenue growth at the top 500 private companies in China as measured by sales slowed by about 10% on average last year, according to a survey released earlier this month by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, a chamber of commerce led by the Communist Party. The organization describes itself as a ""bridge"" linking the party and the government with private business groups. Profit growth at those companies fell by an average of nearly 6%, while the size of their workforce slumped by roughly 1% compared to 2018. Those problems aren't explained simply by government intervention. China's economic slowdown A secondary role It's not that Beijing no longer cares about having a robust private sector. After all, such businesses are critical to the health of the economy. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang ""In reality, Xi is not anti-private sector per se,"" said Tsang, of the SOAS China Institute. ""While he clearly puts the state sector ahead, he is willing to support private enterprises provided the enterprises concerned adhere closely to the party's leadership."" ""But for private enterprises that do not adhere closely to the party's direction, they can expect to face pressure from the authorities,"" he added. There are some consequences for such a strategy, though. Western authorities have been historically mistrustful of how closely some private companies are tied to Beijing -- a concern that is only growing as tensions between the United States and China escalate. The short form video app TikTok, for example, has ignited a political firestorm in the United States because US authorities are wary about its ties to Beijing. But Lam, the professor, said those concerns might not matter much to Xi. The Chinese leader has already made it clear that he wants his country to ""Xi is a super hawk,"" Lam said. ""He doesn't care much about the West, because his priority is about tightening the control of China and maintaining the party's domestic rule.""",Xi Jinping wants China's private companies to fight alongside the Communist Party

However, the nation's top infectious disease expert also noted if you are traveling or are unaware of the ""Get vaccinated and you can enjoy the holidays very easily. And if you're not, please be careful,"" Fauci said. ""Get tested if you need to get tested when you're getting together, but that's not a substitute for getting vaccinated. Get yourself vaccinated and you can continue to enjoy interactions with your family and others."" Fauci's comments come as the US faces the second holiday season of the pandemic, but the first with safe and effective vaccines now available to people ages 5 and older. Still, a significant part of the eligible population remains unvaccinated. According to data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 196 million people, or 59% of the total US population is fully vaccinated. But about 26.6% of the eligible population, or 83 million people, have yet to receive a first dose. The vast majority of Covid-19 deaths so far this year have been among unvaccinated people, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Sunday. ""More than a thousand people dying every day - the vast majority of them unvaccinated. Those are preventable deaths, probably at least 100,000 of the deaths that have happened this year didn't need to,"" Collins said. The seven-day average of vaccinations has increased - about 36% compared to last week - due in large part to vaccinations among newly eligible children. Definition of 'fully vaccinated' remains the same Another factor here is vaccine booster doses: As of Friday, the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration The agencies had already said everyone who got Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine two months ago or more should get a booster. For now, Fauci said the US definition of ""fully vaccinated"" remains the same - two doses given within a certain timeframe - but those guidelines could potentially change with more data. ""Two shots for a time frame means you are fully vaccinated, but the thing you want to get the people and the viewers to understand, it isn't the effectiveness of the vaccine - it's quite effective - it's how long it lasts,"" he said. ""We're going to take a look right now at what the durability is of the booster. We're going to follow people who get boosted,"" Fauci told Bash. ""It will be guided by the science - and people should not be put off by the fact that as time goes by and we learn more and more about the protection that we might modify the guidelines."" Fauci underscored the importance of vaccines and boosters going into the next few months, as he noted an uptick in cases is ""not unexpected"" in the winter. Those who are eligible for vaccines but remain unvaccinated pose a risk not just to themselves and other people who are unvaccinated, he said, ""but it also spills over into the vaccinated people, because no vaccine is 100% effective."" ""We have a lot of virus circulating around. We know that there are breakthrough infections and that's how you get the uptick in cases,"" Fauci said.

""We are continuing to learn a year into the pandemic,"" Dr. Becky Smith, medical director of infection prevention and control and an infectious diseases specialist at Yet there are still some answers to questions that doctors say Covid-19 survivors should know. How much of a risk is reinfection? The risk of reinfection ""seems to be quite low"" and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""states the risk of reinfection is 'low' within the first 90 days of having a Covid infection,"" Smith said. Although rare, the risk exists. ""Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected,"" the ""The risk of reinfection remains low, but we have to be vigilant with the emergence of the new variants,"" Dr. Antonio Crespo, medical director of infectious diseases at the The Scientists are not surprised to see the coronavirus changing and evolving - it's what viruses do, after all. And with so much unchecked spread across the United States and other parts of the world, the virus is getting plenty of opportunity to do just that. So far, three variants circulating around the world have been identified and getting a lot of attention: variant B.1.1.7 was first identified in the United Kingdom, variant B.1.351 was first identified in South Africa and variant P.1 was first identified in Brazil. The coronavirus variants circulating globally are projected to become more dominant in the United States by the spring, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, At the same briefing, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that every Covid-19 case in the United States now should be treated as if it is caused by one of the newly identified coronavirus variants. Another reason why the risk of reinfection remains somewhat a mystery is because it remains unclear for just how long Covid-19 antibodies might last in your body. How long will my antibodies last?  ""What we know is that when somebody gets infected with Covid-19, they do get antibodies that can last,"" Crespo said. ""But now the new science that is emerging is that some of the coronavirus variants could evade the antibodies and could potentially be infectious for somebody who had already been infected with a well-known variant of Covid-19."" Smith said that in one large study of more than 12,000 health care workers at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom, very few with Covid-19 antibodies became infected a second time during a six-month period. That study, published in the ""Those who developed reinfection had asymptomatic infections,"" Smith said in her email. Smith added that anecdotal evidence from her hospital's experience in managing Covid-infected health care workers suggests that antibodies are likely protective against reinfection. ""To date, approximately 0.5% of health care workers have experienced reinfection events, though we acknowledge have not systematically checked for Covid antibodies as in the Oxford study,"" said Smith, who was not involved in the study. People who have been infected with Covid-19 are likely to be protected against catching it again for at least five months, according to a new study led by Public Health England. The study - which has not yet been peer reviewed - found that past infection was linked to an But researchers warned that the protection was not absolute, meaning some people do catch the virus again, and that it was unclear how long any immunity lasts. It is also possible that those who have a degree of immunity against the virus may still be able to carry the virus in their nose or throat and therefore transmit it to others. Do I need to get the vaccine if I've had Covid-19? Health officials and doctors encourage people who have had Covid-19 to still get vaccinated. Late stage clinical trial data suggested the vaccines are safe and helped protect people with past Covid-19 infections from reinfection. This was regardless of their past case being mild or severe. ""Even if someone had a natural Covid-19, my recommendation is to get vaccinated as soon as vaccine is available to you,"" Smith said. ""It is very clear that the two available vaccines afford a high level of protection as measured in neutralizing antibody titers. This may be particularly important for people who had an asymptomatic or mild infection,"" she said.  ""Having a higher level of antibody titers to begin with will protect you for a longer amount of time."" Smith added that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, authorized for emergency use in the United States, appear to provide some protection against the emerging coronavirus variants circulating around the world. ""We are not sure if natural immunity will protect someone from getting infected with the new strains,"" Smith said. A person who is currently sick with Covid-19 should, however, wait to get the vaccine after their symptoms have cleared up and they can come out of isolation. There's no recommended minimum time between infection and vaccination. Also there is no safety data on people who have been given an antibody therapy or convalescent plasma to treat a Covid-19 infection. Since reinfection seems to be uncommon in the 90 days after the initial infection, as a precaution, the CDC recommends the person wait at least 90 days. There's no data that shows a vaccine would protect someone who has been recently exposed. A person isn't fully protected until one or two weeks after they get the second dose of the vaccine. Do I need both doses of the vaccine? The It's currently recommended for people to follow that vaccine schedule until more research is conducted and health officials recommend otherwise. ""The concept of giving just one booster vaccine to those who have had natural infection has been raised as a way to preserve the limited supply of vaccine and make it available to those who never developed Covid infection,"" Smith said. Some emerging evidence in a pre-print paper, ""Logically, people who have had Covid infection are likely to start with a baseline of some detectable neutralizing antibody so you are not starting from scratch like you would be for individuals who never had Covid,"" Smith said. ""However, the amount of neutralizing antibodies decreases over time so this needs to be carefully studied before rolling it out,"" she said. ""We would need data to determine the optimal timing of the booster from natural infection and whether the duration of protection is equivalent to the protection you get from two doses of vaccine."" Smith added that coronavirus variants would also remain a risk. ""We also are unsure about variant strains and how well antibodies developed from natural infection protect someone against a new strain. Vaccines have been tested and afford protection based on limited data,"" Smith said. ""Finally, this approach would require patients to get antibody tested before vaccination and this may not be readily available for everyone."" Could I still be experiencing lingering effects Covid-19? Many survivors of Covid-19 may experience symptoms for weeks or months. ""Patients may experience persistent severe fatigue, headaches, 'brain fog,' mild cognitive impairment/difficulty thinking or concentrating, joint pains, cough, shortness of breath, intermittent fevers, alterations in taste and smell among other symptoms,"" Smith said. ""These lingering symptoms may last up to 12 weeks and many say the symptoms wax and wane or come and go during that time."" Whether you suffer lasting Covid-19 symptoms may depend on the severity of the disease that you have. ""Some people have mild symptoms and they recover quickly and they don't have major problems. One of the side effects that we've seen very often is chronic fatigue,"" Crespo said. ""It seems that with patients with Covid-19, it's one of the common symptoms that can linger for several months,"" he added. ""Also if patients have had significant lung involvement with severe pneumonia, they may have difficulty recovering from that persistent shortness of breath, cough and getting easily tired.""

The state health department attempted to renew the emergency rules this week, but was overruled by a state legislative oversight committee. In its opinion Thursday, Illinois' 4th district appellate court pointed to the expiration of the emergency rules and declared Pritzker's appeal to be moot. The court also found that the restraining order ""in no way restrains school districts from acting independently from the executive orders or the (Illinois Department of Public Health) in creating provisions addressing COVID-19."" Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokesperson for Pritzker, said the governor was ""disappointed"" in the ruling and that he would appeal to the state Supreme Court. ""In the meantime, the Governor urges everyone to continue following the doctors' advice to wear masks so students can remain safely learning in classrooms, and is encouraged that the court made it clear that school districts can continue to keep their own mitigations in place,"" Abudayyeh said in a statement.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/14/health/lasting-immunity-covid-19-antibodies-studies/index.html,"CNN Three new reports show coronavirus immunity can last for months - and maybe even longer. The findings suggest that many, if not most, people who recover from coronavirus infections are protected for at least a period of time. They also suggest that coronavirus vaccines may be able to protect people for more than just a few weeks. One study found that people produce antibodies that protect against infection and last for at least five to seven months. ""We have one person that is seven months out. We have a handful of people that are five to seven months out,"" Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunobiologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, told CNN. ""We conclude that neutralizing antibodies are stably produced for at least 5-7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" his team wrote in a report They have been working with county officials to test volunteers in Arizona since April 30, ever since they developed a blood test for coronavirus. Like many researchers, they found antibodies to the coronavirus spiked immediately following infection and then crashed. But that wasn't the end of the story. The B cells that create antibodies mature into what are called plasma cells, Bhattacharya said. ""Generally, you get a ton of short-lived plasma cells,"" he said. ""They make a ton of antibodies."" But these are not antibodies that do much to protect the body from the virus. ""The best cells compete with each other,"" he said. ""Only those go on to become long-lived cells. Those form later in the response."" The team has tested close to 30,000 people and has looked at some who have been tested several times. ""I think it's good news,"" Bhattacharya said. The novel coronavirus has only been around for less than a year, so it will take time to know just how long immunity lasts. ""That said, we know that people who were infected with the first SARS coronavirus, which is the most similar virus to SARS-CoV-2, are still seeing immunity 17 years after infection. If SARS-CoV-2 is anything like the first one, we expect antibodies to last at least two years, and it would be unlikely for anything much shorter,"" he said. The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus infected close to 8,000 people and killed about 800 before it was stopped in 2004. People who were sicker with Covid-19 had a stronger immune response, Bhattacharya said. ""The people sampled from the ICU had higher levels of antibodies than people who had milder disease."" He doesn't yet know what that will mean for long-term immunity. Plus, the researchers have not checked to see if people were exposed to the virus a second time and were able to resist becoming infected again. And the studies do not support the idea that the US or any other country could reach herd immunity soon through natural infection. The World Health Organization estimates only 10% of the population has been infected with Covid-19. That leaves a long way to go to herd immunity. However, two other studies support the idea of long-lasting immunity. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital tested 343 coronavirus patients, most of them severely ill in hospital. They had elevated levels of certain antibodies called IgG antibodies for up to four months, they reported ""We showed that key antibody responses to Covid-19 do persist,"" infectious disease specialist Dr. Richelle Charles of Massachusetts General Hospital said in a statement. Two other antibody types - IgM and IgA - first spiked and then crashed in these patients. ""We can say now that if a patient has IgA and IgM responses, they were likely infected with the virus within the last two months,"" Charles said. ""Knowing how long antibody responses last is essential before we can use antibody testing to track the spread of COVID-19 and identify 'hot spots' of the disease,"" said Dr. Jason Harris, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who worked on the study. A Canadian team used saliva tests and had similar findings. Their patients had IgG antibodies that lasted up to 115 days after they first developed symptoms. ""This study confirms that serum and saliva IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are maintained in the majority of COVID-19 patients for at least 3 months post symptom onset,"" they ""This study suggests that if a vaccine is properly designed, it has the potential to induce a durable antibody response that can help protect the vaccinated person against the virus that causes COVID-19,"" Jennifer Gommerman, professor of immunology at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. ""Our study suggests saliva may serve as an alternative for antibody testing. While saliva is not as sensitive as serum, it is easy to collect,"" Gommerman added.",New reports show coronavirus immunity can last for months
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/19/health/boosters-questions-wellness/index.html,"CNN The question of who can or should get booster doses of coronavirus vaccines is much simpler now. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration have okayed boosters for every adult who got Moderna's or Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine six months ago or longer. The agencies had already said everyone who got Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine two months ago or more should get a booster. Friday's decision means everyone 18 and older who is fully vaccinated should consider getting another dose of vaccine. Previous guidance was more complicated and CDC vaccine advisers expressed relief at the idea that the advice would be more streamlined. ""The current guidelines, so well intentioned and thoughtful, generate an obstacle to uptake of boosters. In pursuit of precision, they create confusion,"" Dr. Nirav Shah, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and director of Maine's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told Friday's meeting of CDC vaccine advisers before they voted to recommend broader guidelines. ""Our concern is that eligible individuals are not receiving boosters right now because of this confusion."" SO WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR BOOSTERS NOW? Anyone who's at least 18 and was fully vaccinated at least six months ago. For those who got Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine, that means two doses. The CDC and FDA had already recommended that anyone who got Johnson & Johnson's Janssen one-shot vaccine two months ago or longer should get a booster dose. In most cases, people should be able to get a free booster vaccine by showing a CDC vaccination card. WHICH VACCINE SHOULD PEOPLE GET? The authorization to mix and match vaccines still applies, so it doesn't matter. People who got two doses of Pfizer vaccine may either get a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, or they may opt for a Moderna booster, which is a half-sized dose of the regular Moderna dose, or they can get a Johnson & Johnson booster. The same goes for all the vaccines. Plus, people who got a vaccine that has not been authorized in the US - for example, an AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe or the Caribbean--may get a booster dose of Pfizer's vaccine in the US. Studies show that any of the three vaccines, given as boosters, bump people's immunity back up to levels provided after the second dose. For the J&J vaccine, a booster makes immunity stronger than it was after the first dose. Data presented to CDC's vaccine advisers Friday showed booster shots of either Moderna's or Pfizer's vaccine were safe, caused no worrying side-effects, and revved up people's immune responses regardless of age. One consistent pattern: Moderna's booster caused more immediate reactions such as sore arms, fatigue and headaches. Even at the half-sized booster dose, Moderna's product delivers more vaccine than Pfizer's full-sized dose does - 50 micrograms versus 30 micrograms - and doctors say it's possible that accounts for the difference. But there were no concerning safety reports from either, according to CDC vaccine safety specialists. HOW LONG UNTIL THE BOOSTER PROTECTS ME? As with the second dose of vaccine, doctors say it takes two weeks for immunity to peak. So the CDC is recommending that people get their boosters as soon as possible. People who have not received boosters yet won't be able to get one in time to achieve peak renewed immunity before Thanksgiving, but other holidays are coming and the prospect of winter travel has officials worried. WHAT ABOUT TEENS AND CHILDREN? The biggest risks from waning immunity are to older adults - especially those 65 and older. That's why the FDA and CDC acted first for that age group, as well as for people otherwise at risk of severe disease, such as those with medical conditions, even if they are younger. The companies that make the vaccines have not reported any evidence that people 18 and under who got vaccinated are suffering from waning immunity or breakthrough infections yet. These younger age groups are less at risk of severe disease overall, and there's less of a concern about the danger to them from breakthrough infections. Pfizer's vaccine was authorized for children as young as 12 in May, which would put some children that age at the six-month mark. But the CDC and FDA are far more concerned about getting boosters to adults first - and, most important, getting the first shots into the millions of adults and children who are authorized to be vaccinated but who haven't been yet. DOES THIS CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF WHO'S FULLY VACCINATED? Not in the United States. The CDC defines a fully vaccinated person as someone two weeks after having received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at least three weeks apart, two doses of Moderna's vaccine four weeks apart or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. That hasn't changed. At least two governors - New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham and Connecticut's Ned Lamont, both Democrats, have said they don't consider people fully vaccinated unless they've had a booster, but so far those are opinions, not policies. IF I GET A BOOSTER, AM I DONE FOREVER? It's too soon to say. It's possible that as with vaccines like the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, once the initial few doses are out of the way, people can count on being immune for life. Doctors hope that boosting six months after the initial dose will provide much longer-lasting immunity than giving two quick doses a few weeks apart - even as they agree that was 100% the right approach for a new vaccine being used at the start of a pandemic. It's also too soon to know whether immunity might wane after months or years. And it's too soon to know if a new variant might emerge and spread that evades the protection offered by a vaccine and, as with flu vaccines every year, the formula may have to be tweaked protect against the changed virus.",The booster question is now much simpler than before
https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/21/health/cdc-omicron-booster-studies/index.html,"CNN Three large new studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight the importance of getting a booster shot to provide the best protection against the Omicron coronavirus variant. This is the first real-life data to examine the effect of boosters against Omicron, which now accounts for more than 99% of coronavirus cases in the United States. The studies, released Friday, raise the question of whether people with just two vaccine doses should still be considered fully vaccinated. ""I think we have to redefine fully vaccinated as three doses,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime CDC vaccine adviser who was not involved with the studies. The studies have an enormous scope, involving millions of cases, hundreds of thousands of visits to emergency departments and urgent care centers, and tens of thousands of hospitalizations among adults. Getting boosted was 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations during a period in December and January when Omicron was the dominant variant, according to a CDC study that looked at nearly 88,000 hospitalizations across 10 states. In comparison, getting two shots was 57% effective when it had been at least six months past the second shot Getting boosted was 82% effective at preventing visits to emergency rooms and urgent care centers, according to the study, which looked at more than 200,000 visits in 10 states. In comparison, getting two shots was only 38% effective at preventing those visits when it had been at least six months past the second shot. ""I think it's the third dose that really gives you the solid, the very best protection,"" Schaffner said. That A third study, published in the All three studies found that unvaccinated people faced the highest risks of becoming sick with Covid-19. The CDC currently says a person is considered fully vaccinated after they've received their primary Covid-19 vaccines - two weeks after receiving their second dose of an mRNA vaccine, or two weeks after their first dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Booster doses are recommended for everyone age 12 and older five months after their primary vaccination series. Less than half of those eligible to receive booster shots have gotten one, and only about a quarter of the total US population is fully vaccinated and boosted, according to CDC data. Nearly 20% of the US population eligible to be vaccinated - those age 5 and older - has not received any dose of Covid-19 vaccine.","Boosters provide the best protection against Omicron variant, CDC studies show, raising new questions about what it means to be fully vaccinated"

The companies are seeking an amendment to the existing EUA for booster doses for some adults. The companies said the submission is based on results of a Phase 3 trial involving more than 10,000 participants; it found boosters were safe and had an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic Covid-19 compared with the two-dose vaccine schedule in the period when the highly transmissible Delta was the dominant strain.

She is also author of a new book, ""Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health,"" and the mother of two young kids.   Yes, we are dealing with a very contagious virus, the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Yes, we are unfortunately seeing an uptick again in cases. And yes, I am concerned about what will happen this winter, because we saw from last year that when the weather is colder, people go indoors, where the risk of transmission is higher. The upcoming holidays do also worry me, because of the increase in indoor gatherings. However, unlike last year, we have vaccines that add an important layer of protection. We also have other tools, like testing, that can help. I don't think we need to be resigned to a winter surge. We can prevent it if we work together.   Those Let's also talk about non-coronavirus aspects of health. To begin with, make sure to get the flu vaccine. It can be given at the same time as a coronavirus vaccine or booster. The flu vaccine reduces the likelihood of contracting the flu and the severity of illness if you still end up getting influenza. This is particularly important because last year was a light flu season, which means that many people don't have immunity to influenza. We want to prevent the possibility of a ""twin-demic"" of the flu and Covid-19. For children, make sure they are up to date on other immunizations too. And for both children and adults, pay attention to other health maintenance issues. Many It's also vital to mention mental health, which is just as important as physical health. The pandemic has been very challenging for many people. Mental health was already an unmet need before Covid-19. Now is the time to   High-quality masks (N95, KN95, KF94) are now widely available. Make sure to have at least five masks for every household member. These should be worn when in indoor, crowded areas. I'd also highly recommend stocking up on rapid tests. Your family should have at least one, ideally two, rapid tests for every member of the household. These are tests that are available for purchase over the counter at your local pharmacy. Results come back within 15 minutes. That's different from the gold-standard test, the PCR test. In many places, you need to get a doctor's note to obtain a PCR test or you may need to go to an urgent care to be seen. That adds expense; also, results may take 24 hours or more to return. Because PCR tests are not as readily available, rapid tests can be helpful if someone starts having symptoms, especially if it takes time to get a PCR test and then obtain the results. Rapid tests are also very useful for screening purposes, for example, before you get together with friends and relatives indoors.   Here's the thing, though -- Covid-19 is not quite done with us yet. We still have more than 80,000 new daily infections and more than 1,100 Americans dying every day from the coronavirus. We are at a much better place than we were last year, thanks to the vaccine, but we are not out the woods yet. That said, there is a lot that we can resume doing to try to get back to normalcy.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/12/health/fda-vaccine-advisers-pfizer-booster-request/index.html,"CNN The US Food and Drug Administration is unlikely to ask its outside vaccine advisers to weigh in on whether the agency should authorize Pfizer Covid-19 boosters for all adults, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Pfizer Allowing boosters for all adults has been controversial, as some FDA vaccine advisers are concerned about the risk of myocarditis -  inflammation of the heart muscle - a rare side effect that occurs mainly in young men. The source said ""it's unlikely there is going to be a meeting"" of the outside advisers and that ""there has been no discussion of a meeting"" to discuss Pfizer's application. In a statement, the FDA said the agency ""will determine whether to hold a meeting of the advisory committee ...  following its initial review of the information submitted."" When the FDA's vaccine advisory panel convened last month, the chairman of the committee appeared to lay the groundwork for the group to not reconvene every time there was a decision to be made about booster eligibility. Dr. Arnold Monto, the acting chairman of the advisory committee, asked an FDA official who was present ""about how we can get a little more flexibility so we don't have to meet and discuss every time we want to go down in age group."" Monto added in an interview with CNN that as new booster data comes in, several steps must be taken to reconvene the committee. ""In a dynamic situation, it's very cumbersome to be convened - we have to be screened every time for conflicts of interest and everything else that's needed to have a meeting - all the legal niceties,"" he said. ""Our role is to advise on overall policy and to leave the details to the FDA because one, we are advisory, and two, we cannot, the way we are set up, respond quickly to changing circumstances."" If the FDA authorizes boosters for all adults, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's external panel of vaccine advisers will meet to review the plan, a federal official said. ""If FDA authorizes it, [the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] will be meeting as they have met for everything on Covid vaccines since the beginning in December 2020,"" the official said. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky would need to sign off on the agency's final recommendation. ""Dr. Walensky is supportive of using vaccine boosters to protect Americans from COVID-19 when medically necessary and eagerly awaits the opportunity to review data related to Pfizer boosters for those 18 years and older,"" a CDC spokesperson told CNN in an email. ""Any decision will come after a thorough review of the science, and consultation with internal and external advisors."" A rocky start Boosters have had a rocky start in the United States. In mid-August, President Joe Biden A few days later, Pfizer sought the FDA's approval for booster doses for everyone age 16 and older who were at least six months past their second shot. But vaccine advisers objected, and instead the FDA authorized Pfizer boosters for a more limited group of adults who are six months past their second shot, including the elderly and those at high risk for developing severe Covid-19. The FDA also authorized boosters for Moderna vaccine recipients in these categories, and for all Johnson & Johnson recipients. In the Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA vaccine advisory committee, said it would be best for the FDA and the CDC to bring Pfizer's current application to their advisers. ""I think we need to be transparent about this decision, and the best way for us to be transparent is to hold advisory committee meetings at both the FDA and the CDC so the public can hear the discussion about why this an important thing to do,"" he said. He added that at these meetings, which are public, the data could be laid out. ""I think we need to show why a booster dose is clearly of benefit to 18-29 year-olds, because if it's not clearly of benefit, we have to consider the fact that myocarditis was a second dose phenomenon and may also be a third dose phenomenon. Do the benefits clearly and definitively outweigh risks for 18-29 year old?"" Offit said. Monto, the FDA vaccine commitee's acting chair, said there is a precedent for FDA opting not to consult the vaccine advisory committee on certain decisions. He said members of the committee meet ""at the discretion of the FDA. They are only advisory, and there is a history of [the committee] not meeting over points in which the FDA does not feel they need the advice of the committee.""",Source: FDA will likely make booster decision without outside advisory committee weighing in
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/12/health/covid-cases-winter-surge/index.html,"CNN The coronavirus numbers don't look so good this week. New Covid-19 diagnoses are up in about half of US states over the past week. Hospitalizations are up in 11 states, and deaths have risen in 17 states. US coronavirus cases have plateaued in recent weeks, holding on to about half of the growth from this summer's latest surge. While new cases have fallen in some states, they're rising in others, particularly some region's cold-weather states. Southern states that were a large driving force behind this summer's surge now have some of the lowest case rates. Two months ago, Florida and Texas together accounted for nearly a quarter (22%) of all new cases. Now, those two large states account for just 6% of all cases. Florida sliced new cases to a 10th of what they were two months ago and Texas to a fifth. That should sound like good news. But with less dramatic decreases in other, less populous states - and slight increases in some others, particularly in the Northeast and Mountain regions - overall US numbers are holding steady on the whole. It's confusing, and the numbers may be sending a mixed message to people. They are not, however, sending a mixed message to epidemiologists, who do not foresee a good winter for the US or for the world. Too many people remain unvaccinated, and too many continue to defy and even fight advice to wear masks when indoors with other people. This dangerous combination might mean more surges, even if not as high as in the recent past, and in areas beyond those currently seeing rising cases. ""I don't know what's going to happen over the next few weeks. But I have a feeling it's not going to be pretty,"" Michael Osterholm, who heads the center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN. ""Today is a really sad day,"" epidemiologist Ali Mokdad, who has been tracking the coronavirus pandemic since the beginning at the University of Washington, told CNN. ""Cases are going up. It was coming down. This is at a time when the United States has all the tools we need to prevent a surge, all the tools we need to save lives. We have the best vaccines, and we have plenty of them,"" he said. ""And people are not willing to get them."" False sense of security Mokdad said states such as Florida have a false sense of security. ""Florida has a large population of the elderly, who went and got vaccinated. And the young people simply got infected. So the virus ran out of people to infect,"" he said. But he said immunity on both groups is waning. ""There will be a lot of winter travel to Florida,"" he said. ""Infections will start all over again,"" he predicted. ""We are so interconnected."" Diagnoses and hospitalizations are both headed upward in Michigan, with hospitalizations up 20% in the past week, according to state data. ""Metro Detroit once again is becoming a hotspot,"" Dr. Nick Gilpin, director of infection prevention and epidemiology at Beaumont Health, a health system in southeast Michigan, told a news conference Thursday. ""I have a feeling we'll be in this world for the next couple months because I don't see much that can change this unless people start radically changing behavior. This could be a four or five month affair,"" Gilpin added. Like Mokdad, Gilpin blames the unvaccinated and a refusal to wear masks. It's hitting hospitals and clinics hard, he said. ""I mean, it's brutal. No one wants to see these Covid patients this late. But we're masking up and trying to help people get better,"" Gilpin said. ""That said, there's probably no hospital in the state that isn't dealing with staffing shortages. It's difficult, especially as we look to a fourth surge that could last through the winter. This surge is shaping up more to be a marathon than a sprint."" Millions still unvaccinated can fuel new surges In Colorado, where cases were up 30% in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data, Gov. Jared Polis declared the entire state to be at high risk of Covid-19 transmission or exposure and signed an executive order saying everybody over 18 was eligible for a booster dose of vaccine. ""We want to ensure that Coloradans have every tool they need to protect themselves from this deadly virus and to help reduce the stress on our hospitals and health care workers. Every Coloradan is now eligible to get the booster so they can protect themselves and their families,"" Polis said in a statement. Mokdad approves. ""Science is telling us we need three doses to be immune,"" he said.  ""We are losing our credibility as scientists unless you say it - we need three doses to be protected."" The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have OK'd booster doses for most US adults, and the FDA is considering extending authorization for booster doses of Pfizer's vaccine to all adults. Osterholm thinks boosting people will help - but says it's far more important to get more people vaccinated in the first place. ""If we see upticks in L.A. or New York City, we could just as easily find ourselves back to where we were. At this point, there's no evidence of that happening,"" he ""But I must tell you that given the rates of vaccination ... we surely could see major surges in both of those metropolitan areas where with the population density being what it is, could really, truly raise the number of national cases in short order,"" he added. An estimated 60 million Americans remain unvaccinated. That's plenty of people who can help fuel new surges, Osterholm said. ""Overall, there's still a lot of human wood left for this coronavirus forest fire to burn,"" he said. Even in states, cities and counties with high vaccination rates, enough people remain unvaccinated or undervaccinated to help keep the virus spreading. And if immunity is waning as quickly as some studies indicate it may be, Osterholm fears more breakthrough infections, even among the vaccinated. What could be ahead this winter Osterholm is pessimistic about the coming weeks. ""That fact, combined with Delta, schools and upcoming holidays, has me skeptical that we won't be seeing new hotspots emerge in this country over the next several weeks and months. So where do I see us going? I think we will continue to see surges. They may not be nearly as high as the ones we've just had, but they will occur."" And they will not be restricted to the current hotspots, Mokdad predicted. The holidays will make sure of that. ""People are moving out and about like there is no Covid-19,"" he said.""We are going to see Americans traveling - Thanksgiving and then all the way through New Year. We are going to see a surge, and that surge is going to be very bad."" AAA is And plenty of states have such low vaccination levels that they're bonfires waiting to be ignited, Mokdad said. ""I mean, West Virginia [is] 41.1% fully vaccinated. So 60% of the population, at least, don't have immunity against infection,"" he said. ""So, what do you expect? We're going to have a surge. If you look at Montana, 51%. Wyoming, 44.6%. I mean, you could go on and on. There's so many states right now below 50. Louisiana, 48.1%. Alabama, 45.2%."" These same states, Mokdad and Osterholm both pointed out, have populations largely resistant to mask use, as well. ""Nobody is listening,"" Mokdad said morosely. He said he and fellow epidemiologists were discussing how they could bring attention to the dire situation. ""Some of us we were talking about going on a hunger strike. We are really frustrated. It's depressing that we know how protect our population and we are not doing it,"" he said.","The Covid-19 numbers seem stuck. That doesn't bode well for winter, experts say"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/14/economy/coronavirus-china-economy-small-businesses/index.html,"CNN Business The small companies that drive While some larger companies are A survey of 163 companies of all sizes across China found that less than half were able to get back to work this week, according to investment bank China International Capital Corp, which published the results. Even more alarming: A third of roughly 1,000 small and medium-sized companies surveyed by academics from Tsinghua University and Peking University last week said they could only survive for a month with the cash they have. That could spell It's not clear how many of those companies will ultimately feel ""The coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the camel's back,"" wrote Zhao Jian, director of the Shandong province-based Atlantis Research Institute in a research note earlier this month. He warned that if the outbreak doesn't end soon, unemployment will likely rise as businesses shut down -- a problem Beijing had been fighting hard this year to prevent. Job losses could spur a tide of housing foreclosures, Zhao added, compounding the country's economic woes. 'We will die' without more money Some business owners have gone public with their plight. Beijing entrepreneur Wu Hai In the post, Wu lamented the closures and said the lack of business puts his 1,500 workers at risk of losing their jobs. He wrote that his company, MeiKTV, has about 12 million yuan ($1.7 million) in cash on hand, giving it about two months to survive if he's unable to reopen for business. ""That means we will die in April unless investors continue to give us money,"" he wrote. Shu Congxuan, chairman of Home Original Chicken, said last Saturday that his fast food chain has shut more than 400 stores since the outbreak began. In a Weibo post, he warned that his company is in danger of running out of cash, since it still needs to pay rent and employees. But he said he would try to make sure his employees keep their jobs, even if he needs to sell his houses and cars. Other companies appear to be taking desperate measures to recoup at least some of their losses. Beijing-based Meizhou Dongpo Restaurant The outcome for many businesses could be dire if the situation does not improve rapidly. According to the Tsinghua University and Peking University survey of firms, 85% of respondents said they would go out of business if the outbreak lasts three months. By the six month mark, 90% of the companies would collapse. Even a recovery in the near future may not come soon enough for some. Before the outbreak, Chinese companies were preparing to pay back or refinance a lot of debt this year, according to analysts at S&P Global Ratings. Given the rising risk to the economy, they may find it harder to borrow. The S&P researchers warned in a note this week that if the public health crisis stabilizes next month, liquidity will still be under pressure through at least the first half of the year. They added that the outbreak will also heighten the risk of default for Chinese companies. Government may need to do more Beijing already knows that it has a major problem on its hands. Before the outbreak, senior officials had characterized Some of the most prominent companies in China, for example, The government is also stepping in. Last week, the Local governments in Beijing, Shanghai and several provinces have also rolled out targeted measures to help small businesses, including offering subsidies to landlords so they can reduce rents, and allowing small companies to delay the payment of social security contributions or taxes. But it's not clear how helpful some of those policies will be. Wu, the karaoke bar owner, wrote in his WeChat post that he felt his company was still at a ""dead end"" even with the policies offered to him. Social security, for example, is still a major expense for employers. Wu suggested that simply delaying those payments would not really help. ""Social Security Bureau, how generous you are,"" Wu commented sarcastically. ""Our employees are going to lose jobs. The company is going to collapse. You not only don't want to take some money out, but you still want to collect money from us -- not even a penny less!"" Wu did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business. But in his WeChat post he also criticized the usefulness of giving subsidies to landlords. While he said the policy is ""well intended,"" he questioned whether landlords would actually reduce the amount their tenants pay. He also doubted the effectiveness of preferential loans set up by the central bank. ""We have no fixed assets as collateral. We have no operating cash flows -- because we can't open for business -- as collateral,"" Wu wrote.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/04/health/covid-vaccine-side-effects-wen-wellness/index.html,"CNN As more people around the world get access to the coronavirus vaccines, many questions remain. Will it work? Will there be side effects? Do I need to rest after I get the vaccine? Can I hang out with my friends and family now? We spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, for guidance on how to plan for taking care of ourselves and our loved ones as more people get vaccinated.   Once you have the appointment, make sure to follow all instructions. Complete paperwork if there is any that you need to do in advance. Bring all required documentation; some places ask for identification or proof of residency, so know what you need and make sure you have it. If you know of others who received a vaccination at that same location, you can ask what their experiences are like -- for example, how long the wait was. Keep in mind that there is a lot that's evolving as sites figure out how best to do mass vaccinations, so someone's experience from a couple of weeks ago might look different now. I would also urge that you get any questions you have about the vaccines answered in advance. You want to minimize your time at the vaccination site, and the people there are likely to be very busy and may not have the time to answer your questions in-depth. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has   If this is a drive-thru test,   Many people have no symptoms beyond that. Some develop side effects in one of two categories. First, they could have more soreness, redness and swelling at the site of the injection. Second, they could have what we call systemic symptoms, meaning that they feel something throughout their body. They may develop headache, fever, fatigue and muscle aches. These could last hours and usually go away after a day. Most people with these symptoms find them to be a minor inconvenience. They can go to work and go about their day. Some people may feel the symptoms a bit more. Rest usually takes care of the symptoms, and people can also take ibuprofen or Tylenol to help with aches and fever.   It's important to note that people react differently to vaccines. There are some people who have minimal or no side effects. That doesn't mean there's something wrong with them, either. The vaccine is also working in them, but their bodies are just reacting in a different way.   Because some people have this stronger reaction the second time around, it's a good idea to try to schedule the shot when you have the ability to rest if needed. Some people schedule the second shot when they are off or at least are able to work from home. If you can't do that, you may want to let your employer know that you're getting the vaccine in case you need to take time off that day or the next.   People should wait 15 minutes just in case. If this is a drive-thru vaccination, they can wait in their cars; otherwise, there is an area where people can sit or stand and be observed just in case they have a reaction. In the very rare circumstance they develop a reaction, this can easily be treated by the nurses and doctors at the site. Those with a history of very severe allergic reactions to other medications or foods are asked to wait 30 minutes. Note that those individuals can still get the vaccine -- the only reason not to get the vaccine is if they have a known allergy to a component of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine itself. One more thing: After you get vaccinated, please register for the CDC's V-Safe program. You can quickly enter any side effects you may have, and depending on your answers, someone from the CDC may call to check on you. Side effects are to be expected, and the government still tracks them as part of routine monitoring after a vaccine or medication is released.   The second shot should be taken in the time period that's approved: three weeks after the first dose for Pfizer and four weeks after the first dose for Moderna. The CDC has said that in exceptional circumstances, you could still get the second shot up to six weeks later, but this should not be the norm.   That's great -- but it's not 100%. You must still use caution when around others, and keep up masking and avoiding crowded indoor settings. Remember, too, that we don't know yet whether getting the vaccine means that you are protected against being a carrier for coronavirus. You may not get sick, but you could still infect others if you're a carrier. All this means that you are better protected against this deadly virus, but you need to still use caution. I know that grandparents have been so eager to see their grandkids. You can do this more safely now, but I'd still try to see people outdoors when possible, with everyone wearing masks, unless everyone has quarantined for seven days and gotten tested. But maybe you can go in for that hug that you've been waiting for. And if you have friends who are also fully vaccinated, it's probably pretty safe to see them. We will get to the point where most of the population is vaccinated and we can finally put an end to the pandemic. Until then, let's please keep safe -- and get vaccinated when it's our turn!",How to prepare for your Covid-19 vaccination -- advice from Dr. Wen
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/16/health/who-should-and-shouldnt-get-covid-19-vaccine/index.html,"CNN The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine being rolled out across the US should be safe for just about anyone - even the frailest elderly people. Under the A health worker ""These vaccines are very well tolerated from the data we've seen,"" said ""We're in a life threatening pandemic. We have no defense. So, for most people, they should absolutely get it, there's very, very few cases that you could argue someone shouldn't get it."" Here's what we know so far about who should, and, possibly shouldn't, get a Covid-19 vaccine. People with vaccine allergies The FDA put only one group in the category of those who should not get the vaccine: people who have a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. A warning on the vaccine Two healthcare workers in the UK who had a history of severe reactions to vaccinations did have  adverse reactions within minutes of getting the Covid-19 shot. Both workers recovered and are doing well, according to National Health System England. In the UK people with vaccine allergies are not being vaccinated for now. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people with a history of vaccine allergies can get the Covid-19 vaccine. Those patients, though, should be told about the unknown risks. Parikh said they may also want to, but are not required to, check in with their doctors. ""A doctor can dig through your history and see what are the chances are of you having a reaction or not,"" Parikh said. ""It's just a very, very small percentage that need that evaluation."" Patients who have had allergic reactions to vaccines in the past should be monitored for 30 minutes after getting the vaccine, according to the FDA guidance. For people without allergies, the recommendation is a 15 minute observation time. People with other allergies People with other allergies, like food or mold allergies, should be fine to get the Covid-19 vaccine. ""In the clinical trials, we actually did not exclude people with allergies, even people with severe food allergies. We only excluded people if they had allergies to vaccine for the Pfizer trial, so that being said, there may have been thousands of people who had allergies and received the vaccine with no issue,"" said Pregnant and lactating women Since there is not enough data yet on the safety of Covid-19 vaccines in ""Covid-19 in a pregnant woman is not a good thing, so someone might decide that they would like to be vaccinated, but that's not something that we're recommending at this time,"" Marks said at a news briefing Saturday. ""That's something we're leaving up to the individual."" The Pfizer clinical trials did not actively enroll pregnant women, but 23 volunteers became pregnant during the course of the trial. There have been no adverse events. Pfizer/BioNTech said it will continue to monitor those women. According to observational data, the absolute risk to pregnant women is considered low. Since mRNA vaccines do not contain any live viruses, they should degrade quickly and won't enter the nucleus of the cell. They cannot cause genetic changes. The The clinical trial did not include women who were breastfeeding, but mRNA vaccines are not thought to be a risk to a breastfeeding infant; therefore, ACOG said the vaccine should be offered to those women as well. People with underlying medical conditions and the elderly People with underlying medical conditions and the elderly can get the Covid-19 vaccine. Late stage clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine showed similar results for people with underlying conditions, compared to people who were healthy. Older adults also tended to report fewer and milder adverse events after they were vaccinated in the clinical trials, according to The immunocompromised The vaccine may be appropriate for people who have a suppressed immune system due to a condition or disease or because they are undergoing a treatment for a disease like cancer. This should be an There were immunocompromised volunteers with stable HIV infections in the Pfizer trial, but there is no specific data about this population, so there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the safety of the vaccine with these patients. ""For pregnant women and the immunocompromised - just at this point - it will be something that providers will need to consider on an individual basis for patients,"" said Marks. People who have or had Covid-19 Late stage clinical trial data suggested the vaccine was safe and helped protect people with past Covid-19 infections from reinfection. This was regardless of their past case being mild or severe. A person who is currently sick with Covid-19 should, however, wait to get the vaccine after their symptoms have cleared up and they can come out of isolation. There's no recommended minimum time between infection and vaccination. People who've taken a Covid-19 antibody treatment There is no safety data on people who have been given an antibody therapy or convalescent plasma to treat a Covid-19 infection. Since reinfection seems to be uncommon in the 90 days after the initial infection, as a precaution, the CDC recommends the person wait at least 90 days. There's no data that shows a vaccine would protect someone who has been recently exposed. A person isn't fully protected until one or two weeks after they get the second dose of the vaccine. Teens Teens who are 16 and 17 can be vaccinated when there is the appropriate consent from an adult. More than 153 teens ages 16 and 17 were included in the Pfizer trial and the early analysis of that data found no safety issues. Details about how this age group reacted to the vaccine are limited, but the CDC said there ""are no biologically plausible reasons for safety and efficacy profiles to be different than those observed in persons 18 years of age and older.""","Who should, and should not, get the Covid-19 vaccine"

""The beginning of 2022 will be rough,"" Slavitt told CNN in a phone interview. Scientists are still studying the characteristics of Omicron, but early research ""The problem with Omicron is hotspots will be easier to generate,"" Slavitt said. ""The things that might have been two or three people getting Covid in the office will be 15 or 30 people getting Covid."" That's why Slavitt, who in June ""If I'm an employer with the option to have people work virtually, I am going to continue to take that,"" he said, adding that not every company ""has that luxury.""

Ford Motor recently Wall Street bank Jefferies asked staff last week to work from home and stopped virtually all travel and social events In light of the Omicron variant, Slavitt said there's ""no question"" CEOs should require employees to get boosters. ""Omicron has turned this undoubtedly into a three-dose vaccine, if it wasn't heading that way already,"" he said. ""Two doses just aren't going to be sufficient any longer."" Pfizer said last week that preliminary studies show two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may not provide sufficient protection against Omicron, but ""Boost everybody. If everybody is boosted, that's your best shot at having everyone back,"" Slavitt said, referring to how business leaders should approach back-to-the-office plans. Jefferies said it will require anyone who wants to enter any office or attend an event to have their booster administered by January 31, unless they are not yet eligible to do so. 'Irresponsible and not going to end well' Some sports leagues have been hit with Covid-19 cases in recent days.  Slavitt urged companies to invest in good ventilation as well as regular at-home instant tests for key events when employees are back together. ""If there is a major outbreak, you have to close again. The problem is, it's hard to police every weak link if this thing is really spreading,"" Slavitt said. ""If we just say, 'I want my people together but am not willing to do anything to make it safe,' that's irresponsible and not going to end well."" Asked to rank from 1 to 10 how concerned he is about Omicron, Slavitt said he's only a 2 or 3 worried about people who are boosted and in communities where lots of people have boosters. But that rises to a 6 or 7 in communities where fewer people have been vaccinated. ""We're going to be living in most communities with Delta plus Omicron, instead of one superseding the other,"" Slavitt said. ""In parts of the country that are unvaccinated, I am very worried."" JPMorgan isn't right to say 2022 is the end of the pandemic, Slavitt says The good news is Slavitt, who has an MBA from Harvard Business School, isn't overly concerned about how disruptive Omicron will be to the economic recovery. That's despite concerns over how the variant could ""I think it will be manageable,"" Slavitt said. ""Many of us mentally live in a 2020 mindset. But now we have seven or eight interventions: rapid tests we can give people, boosters, ventilation, therapies."" Of course, different parts of the country will respond differently to Omicron. ""There is a bit of a split personality in how people react,"" Slavitt said. ""Ron DeSantis will probably go running mask-less into ICU wards without fear. But people in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, California and Pacific Northwest are going to display more caution."" Last week, Asked if JPMorgan is right to say 2022 will be the year the pandemic ends, Slavitt said no. ""They're not right. Could 2022 be the year where the state of emergency ends?

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/14/health/covid-immunity-antibodies-intl/index.html,"CNN People who have been infected with The study - which has not yet been peer reviewed - found that past infection was linked to an 83% lower risk of reinfection, compared to people who have not been infected before. But researchers warned that the protection was not absolute, meaning some people do catch the virus again, and that it was unclear how long any immunity lasts. It is also possible that those who have a degree of immunity against the virus may still be able to carry the virus in their nose or throat and therefore transmit it to others. ""We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts,"" Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and co-leader of the study, said in a statement. ""Even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others,"" Hopkins said. The SIREN research study regularly tested almost 21,000 health workers from across the UK between June and November. Among them, 6,614 people participants tested positive for antibodies against the virus, while more than 14,000 had no signs of previous infection. But of those who had been infected, 44 developed possible new infections - representing an 83% level of protection against reinfection. The study will continue to monitor healthcare workers for 12 months to see if protection lasts even longer, but for now the length of protection identified means that people who caught the virus in the first wave of infections may now be able to catch it again. It will also look into the impact of the new variant and the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. But early insight from the next stage of the study shows that some people with existing immunity carry high levels of virus and could transmit the virus to others. Hopkins highlighted this during an interview with the BBC's Today program on Thursday. ""We found people with very high amounts of virus in their nose and throat swabs, that would easily be in the range which would cause levels of transmission to other individuals."" Hopkins stressed that people who had previously caught Covid-19 still needed to obey social distancing rules to avoid transmitting the disease. ""The SIREN study has major implications for how we can get out of the current crisis. The good news is that this study gives further weight that reinfections of Covid is rare, at least at this stage, and that having antibodies will provide protection for a meaningful amount of time, although it may not be lifelong immunity,"" Dr. Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology, University of Reading, told the Science Media Centre. ""The concerning finding is that some people who have Covid antibodies appear to still be able to carry the coronavirus and could spread it to others. This means that the vast majority of the population will either need to have natural immunity or have been immunised for us to fully lift restrictions on our lives,"" he said. Lawrence Young, Virologist and Professor of Molecular Oncology, Warwick Medical School added that because the results cover the months before the new variant took hold, ""it will be important to determine whether previous infection with the old virus variant is able to offer protection from re-infection with the new virus variant.""

Her immune system was compromised due to the cell-depleting therapy she received, the researchers at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands wrote in a However, the researchers said her natural immune response could still have been ""sufficient"" to fight-off Covid-19, as the type of treatment she received for cancer ""does not necessarily result in life threatening disease."" The patient was initially admitted into hospital earlier this year with a severe cough and fever, testing positive for Covid-19. She was discharged five days later when ""besides some persisting fatigue her symptoms subsided completely,"" according to the report. But two days into chemotherapy treatment - 59 days after the start of the first Covid-19 episode - the woman developed fever, cough and difficulty breathing. She once again tested positive for coronavirus, and no antibodies were detected in her blood system when tested on days four and six.  Her condition deteriorated on day eight. Two weeks later, the woman died. The woman was not tested between infections, so researchers have no confirmed negative tests. However, upon examining the samples from both cases they found the genetic makeup of the two viruses to be different. They therefore concluded that ""it is likely that the second episode was a reinfection rather than prolonged shedding."" This is the first time someone is reported to have died from a second spell of coronavirus. However there have been some reported cases of reinfection worldwide, most recently a The man is the first in the US documented to have been re-infected.

The man had no underlying health conditions but similarly to the Dutch woman, suffered a more severe episode the second time. Unlike the Dutch woman however, the man developed a measurable antibody response after the second episode. Researchers could not conclude how long the man was immune, or if he ever was. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers said: ""Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in at least four individuals worldwide. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 does not necessarily translate to guaranteed total immunity. ""The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application. From a public health perspective, all individuals--whether previously diagnosed or not--must take identical precautions to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Further work is needed to assess immune reactions in vitro after reinfection.""

And while the virus gathers strength, a pandemic of pandemic fatigue undermines our ability to stop the virus. The newly discovered Omicron variant quickly led to border closures, a stock market plunge, and a collective sigh of despair: To stop disease spread, we need to learn quickly, communicate well, and act effectively. There's a lot we The most important unknown about Omicron is to what extent it evades protection from vaccines and prior infection.

The United States and Europe are already experiencing a Although there are important roles for better ventilation and effective testing programs, success confronting Covid will, on one hand, take increased vaccination and indoor masking, including through mandates, and on the other hand, individual and societal decisions on balancing individual and collective risks and benefits. First, vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. That is: Reach those who haven't yet received their first dose. Even places with high vaccination rates are vulnerable to large outbreaks, primarily among the unvaccinated. A more infectious variant increases the threshold for herd immunity. Get third doses to those who are immunosuppressed, and boost everyone. We set ourselves up for new dangerous variants by failing to address global vaccine equity. Most people in high-income countries are fully vaccinated and tens of millions have gotten boosters while Rapidly The mRNA technology is faster to scale up and more easily tweaked to address variants; both companies Second, although we've gotten used to going without masks, with increasing cases and a more infectious variant, it's time to mask up again. If everyone masks indoors where Covid is spreading, everyone is safer. Just as your right to swing your fist doesn't extend to someone else's nose, your right to bare your nose and mouth doesn't extend to killing someone by spreading a deadly virus. Mask mandates need to be implemented, enforced, and adherence monitored to build a collective sense of responsibility and achievement at high levels of mask wearing. This can be done by tracking and publishing rates of appropriate Third, balance risks and benefits. Vaccination and indoor mask mandates are required, both ethically and for disease control.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/20/opinions/kyle-rittenhouse-acquitted-rodgers/index.html,"CNN Kyle Rittenhouse, on trial this month for killing two unarmed men and injuring another during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last summer, was The trial came down to The jury clearly believed the latter, which, given the facts, the law and other circumstances of the trial, is no surprise. This case was always going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors. The key issue was whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, which means that he reasonably feared for his life when he pulled the trigger and shot Joseph Rosenbaum, Anthony Huber and Gaige Grosskreutz that night. Trying to weigh Rittenhouse's self-defense claim amid the two dueling narratives was not an easy job for the jury. One could reasonably argue that Rittenhouse provoked the attacks on him by openly carrying his weapon in a threatening manner, and that he had the option to retreat or otherwise avoid using deadly force, even if defending himself. If the jury had found either of these things to be true, it would have defeated the The laws and applicable legal standards also created a tough road for prosecutors trying to win a conviction here. Our criminal justice system generally favors the defendant, because of our core belief that it is better to see a guilty man go free than to convict an innocent one. Thus in criminal cases, prosecutors carry the highest burden of proof known to our legal system: proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Like in many other states, Wisconsin law is sympathetic to homicide defendants Finally, Judge Bruce Schroeder, who presided over the case with a mercurial demeanor and frequent tongue-lashings, didn't make things easy for the prosecutors. The judge's behavior seemed to some to betray a pro-Rittenhouse bias - for example, when he We don't know exactly what the jury's reasoning was in rendering its verdict - jury deliberations happen in secret, so unless jurors choose to discuss the experience afterward, we will not get a view into how they made their decisions or what pieces of evidence were most compelling to them. But it appears that with evidence supporting both narratives, the jurors concluded that the prosecution failed to meet its burden - and based on this record, it's impossible to find fault with that. This issue - whether a defendant acted reasonably in a stressful moment - is a quintessential jury question. This is exactly why we have a jury system where 12 members of the community come together to judge their fellow man. We, as a democracy, prefer the law to be administered by a group of Without question, Rittenhouse did not have to be in Kenosha with his weapon strapped across his body as he ran around the streets in what was clearly an unpredictable and ultimately dangerous situation. If he had exercised better judgment and decided not to go that night, Rosenbaum and Huber would almost certainly still be alive. But in Wisconsin, that initial decision, as poor a decision as it was, does not constitute a crime, and the jury found his later actions justified. Those of us who don't want to have to worry about whether people like Kyle Rittenhouse will continue to brandish guns at public gatherings, thereby greatly increasing the danger of violence, should direct our energy toward changing the Public sentiment after an episode that is viewed as unfair - and there are plenty of people who are incensed that Rittenhouse went free because of a self-defense claim when he placed himself in the situation in the first place - can spark change. For example, in Georgia, after the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, the legislature repealed the If public concern about Rittenhouse's conduct and its results leads to a re-examination of Wisconsin's gun laws, that will be one positive thing to come out of this tragic episode.","After Rittenhouse verdict, it's time to question the law"

Until now, remdesivir has been the only drug that appeared to have specific effects for coronavirus. It was the only drug with an Emergency Use Authorization for Covid-19 from the US Food and Drug Administration. Results of the WHO study have not been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. But WHO posted them The WHO study reviewed remdesivir and three other repurposed drugs: hydroxychloroquine, the HIV combination of lopinavir and ritonavir and interferon. None of them helped patients live any longer or get out of the hospital any sooner, WHO said. The trial was able to generate conclusive evidence on the impact the drugs had on mortality, the need for ventilation, and duration of hospital stay. ""For each drug in the study, the effect on mortality was disappointingly unpromising,"" WHO said in a statement. Several other studies had found that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, was of no benefit to coronavirus patients, as had several studies looking at the HIV drug combination. The study covered more than 11,000 coronavirus patients in 30 countries. ""The protocol was designed to involve hundreds of potentially over-stressed hospitals in dozens of countries,"" the international team of researchers wrote. They said they have submitted their findings to a medical journal. Prior to the WHO study, a large controlled study of remdesivir in the US found that it shortens recovery time by about a third in severely ill, hospitalized adults with Covid-19, but does little to help those with milder cases. Gilead Sciences, the drug's maker, said the findings did not mean the drug, sold under the brand name Veklury, is of no benefit. ""The emerging data appear inconsistent with more robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of Veklury (remdesivir). We are concerned that the data from this open- label global trial have not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion,"" Gilead said in a statement.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/22/health/boosters-covid-questions-wellness/index.html,"CNN The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has Any of the three authorized vaccines in the US - Pfizer/BioNTech's, Moderna's or the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine - may be used for a booster dose for eligible people. But it's not a complete free-for all. Here are some things to know: Can anyone get a booster now? There are not any booster police, but the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration have set some eligibility requirements around who should be seeking booster shots. People who got a * 65 or older. * At risk of severe Covid-19 from a breakthrough infection because of a medical condition such as diabetes, kidney disease or pregnancy. * At risk because of living conditions or work, so people who work in healthcare, frontline healthcare workers, people living in shelters or incarcerated people. Moderna's vaccine is given as a half dose for boosters; Pfizer's is given as a full dose. Anyone who got a Federal health officials made a point of urging pregnant women to get a booster. ""If you are eligible for a boost and you're pregnant, you should also get your boost during that period of time. And I would say for nursing (mothers) as well,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told a news conference Friday. And there's no reason to wait if you are eligible. The booster can be administered along with other shots, such as flu shots or shingles, pneumococcal or other vaccines. Which is the best booster to get? For the most part, it doesn't matter. Studies indicate it's all right to mix and match vaccine doses and in some cases it may provide a more powerful boost to get a different vaccine type, but any booster dose will bring immune protection up to very high levels. And while some of the initial data suggest that boosting with a different vaccine type from your initial series might provide a stronger response, it's only preliminary data. All the groups in an ongoing study by the National Institutes of Health that compares the three authorized vaccines got a big jump in immunity from a booster shot, starting about 15 days after the booster. Some people might want to use a different vaccine type. For example, a younger man who initially got a Moderna vaccine might seek J&J for the boost, because the mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's and Moderna's are linked with a slight risk of a heart inflammation called myocarditis, while J&J's isn't. Younger men - those under 40 - are at higher risk of myocarditis. And a woman under 50 might prefer to get an mRNA vaccine for her boost, because the J&J vaccine is linked with a slightly higher risk of a rare blood clotting condition that is more likely to affect younger women. ""As a woman in this age group, I opted to get the Pfizer vaccine,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore city health commissioner who's a CNN medical analyst. ""I didn't choose the mRNA vaccine because it's necessarily more effective, but rather because I wanted to avoid the potential of the very serious side effect associated with J&J in younger women. I chose Pfizer purely out of convenience, because the Moderna 50 microgram booster was not yet available when I decided to get my booster. I wouldn't have a reason to prefer Pfizer over Moderna; I would have received whatever I had access to."" Anyone who had a severe reaction to one vaccine type should probably check with their doctor first and should consider getting a different vaccine type for their booster. The CDC assumes most people will just get the same vaccine as a booster as they got originally, and says that would be fine. What if I am not in one of the eligible groups? Should I try to get a booster anyway? The data indicate that the vaccines are still providing very strong protection for most people. While there's some evidence of waning immunity for some people - especially older people - they are still strongly protecting most people against severe disease, hospitalization and death. The CDC is expected to release some more detailed guidelines about boosters and, at Thursday's meeting of vaccine advisers, laid out clinical considerations for who should consider getting boosters. These might include people who are caregivers of people who are at high risk of severe disease. They might want to get boosted so they are even more strongly protected against mild or asymptomatic infections, to protect the people they are caring for. Federal health officials say they are watching data carefully to see if there are indications that immunity is waning for younger groups of healthy people. If so, they say, they can move quickly to lower the age range and other eligibility criteria for boosters. Do you have to pay for boosters? Just as with the first round of vaccines, Covid-19 booster shots are free. ""No insurance or ID required,"" Jeff Zients, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, told a news conference Friday. Some providers may ask for health insurance information because they will bill private insurers for costs associated with providing vaccines. Covid-19 vaccines are free regardless of immigration status. How do I find a booster? The federal government has a website, ""In fact, boosters are available at over 80,000 locations across the country, including more than 40,000 local pharmacies, as well as thousands of doctors' offices, community health centers, rural health clinics, and community-based vaccination sites. Ninety percent of Americans live within five miles of a vaccine site,"" Zients said.",What's the best booster to get? And other questions about Covid-19 boosters

His district only has 5,700 students in it. ""Clearly someone spent a lot of time in their basement working hard to invalidate our survey,"" Hosler said. ""That gives you an idea of how people are reacting to pandemic decisions. This year, for our teachers especially, it feels a lot more stressful and we're only in November."" The questioning of district policy has ""really ramped up"" he said, particularly over one issue: masks. Hosler's is one of 65% of Ohio school districts that, according to the ""No matter what decision we make, there's going to be a loud vocal reaction opposed to it,"" Hosler said. ""It's a little bit liberating in a sense, because we're going to go ahead and make the best decision for kids to keep them safe."" While studies show that masks in school work, whether a child has to wear a mask at school at this point in the Covid-19 pandemic depends largely on where they live in the country. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Due to the highly contagious Delta variant, the CDC guidelines recommend everyone - students, staff, teachers and visitors to K-12 schools - wear masks indoors, regardless of vaccination status. The American Academy of Pediatrics makes a similar recommendation. Yet hundreds of districts around the country made masks optional, according to a CNN analysis of school records. Masks are still mandatory in states including Some schools are rolling back mandates Some, but not all, schools in Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio have made masks in schools optional, often citing declines in Covid-19 cases. In Perrysburg, Hosler said his district's mask policy has changed with case numbers. It started the year with a ""mask strongly encouraged"" policy because cases were low and the vaccination rate in the area was high. Three days into the new school year, there were signs the district needed to do more. ""We saw this increase in cases and we saw it with the younger students, which we really hadn't seen the year before,"" Hosler said. By the second week of school, he made masks mandatory. A couple of weeks ago, after it seemed like the case numbers had fallen again, he made masks optional again. He said his decision was aided by Even with the mask optional policy, about 70% of his students still wear them, he said. The numbers are lower among high school students. ""We're watching the cases closely,"" Hosler said. ""We've already made adjustments and we're prepared to make another adjustment if needed."" Each time the mask policy has changed, he said, he has gotten both pushback and praise. It's similar to when he makes a decision about closing the school for a snow day. ""This kind of decision is like that one on steroids,"" Hosler said. ""No matter what decision we make, there's going to be a loud vocal reaction opposed to it and people are going to be angry."" In Fulton County, Georgia's fourth largest school district, Superintendent Mark Looney decided masks could be optional if the district met one of two benchmarks. One is if the ratio of cases in a school remains less than 1% of students enrolled. The second benchmark is 30 days after vaccines are approved for children over 5 years old, regardless of vaccination status of the students. ""We've learned a lot from managing Covid for almost two years now,"" Looney said. ""The number of Covid cases appears to have peaked and has been trending down since early September. We think that we've weathered most of the storm."" There is still an option to change the policy if conditions make that necessary, Looney said. In Since the vaccination rate at the school is 80%, the district was allowed to make the change under the Commonwealth's policy. This is a trial period for now. The district is bringing mandates back November 22 in anticipation of the Thanksgiving holiday and travel. The Some states are sticking with mask mandates Washington state has kept its mask mandate for all schools and any district that ""willfully"" violates state health requirements risks losing state funding. Washington Secretary of Health Dr. Umair Shah said masking is a critical piece to protect kids and keep them in school when community transmission remains ""higher than any of us would like."" ""Masks work, in addition to other modalities,"" Shah said. Masks, handwashing, vaccinations, and the appropriate physical distancing can be used to keep kids in class. ""Kids want to be around each other, and we found that all of those precautions need to come together,"" he said. Shah said he knows these mitigation factors work because, while schools have had some outbreaks, Washington has been ""markedly better"" than comparable states in the country. ""We all recognize we want to be past this pandemic,"" Shah said. ""but to keep them in school, it's really up to us to make sure that we have as many precautions in place to help keep them safe and protected."" What the science says When there are multiple layers of protection in place - physical distance, handwashing, vaccines and masks - it reduces the transmission of Covid-19, the CDC says. Studies that specifically look at masks show that outbreaks are far more likely in schools that don't require students and staff to wear masks, according to A Another ""We found the benefit of mask wearing are greatest to people who are not yet fully vaccinated and that's where most kids find themselves today,"" said Lewnard, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of California Berkeley's School of Public Health. According to the ""The benefits of mask wearing might be the greatest among this population where you still have a potentially volatile situation when you consider kids, a lot of their interactions, are really occurring with people their same age who also aren't vaccinated. They are kind of in the same place adults were last year before vaccines,"" he said. Jumping the gun? Covid-19 cases are down across the country, yet cases among kids are still considered ""extremely high,"" according to the It's still less likely for children to be hospitalized with Covid-19 compared to adults and less likely for them to die, but long Covid also occurs in about 4-6% of children. Many of those cases were mild to start. Plus, Covid-19 can be fatal for children, even those without underlying health conditions. At least 897 children have died from Covid-19 in the United States since the start of the pandemic, according to the CDC. Dr. Richina Bicette-McCain, an associate medical director at Baylor College of Medicine, said she's watched the end of mandatory mask policies with unease. ""It definitely worries me. I think we are jumping the gun a little bit,"" Bicette-McCain told CNN's Jake Tapper.  ""We saw this happen in June over the summer when we declared the pandemic to be over a bit too early. We decided that those who are vaccinated need not wear masks, which turned into everyone not wearing masks and then subsequently the spike and the Delta wave followed.""  ""We know that indoor contact is the highest risk,"" said Hoyen. ""Whether you're vaccinated or not, it doesn't mean you can't be infected."" Hoyen understands most people don't love wearing a mask, but she thinks kids get why they should. ""A lot of kids know that it's going to keep them safe and it's going to keep them in school and those are the things that they really want,"" Hoyen said. ""You know, for a lot of kids, it's not as big a deal."" Hoyen said with it getting colder outside and people spending even more time indoors, it might be safer to keep mandatory masking in place at least through the end of the year. ""Giving them consistency and expectations can be helpful,"" Hoyen said. ""Masks are working. People are doing OK. Just move forward with them until it gets a little further down the line."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, who thinks masks have helped keep cases down in school, is confident kids won't have to wear them forever. ""No doubt masks make a difference,"" Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy ad Infectious Diseases, said on CNN's New Day. ""Vaccinations are going to really make a big, big difference.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/15/health/children-face-mask-emotions-study-wellness/index.html,"CNN Little kids can often tell how people are feeling, even if that person is wearing a face mask, There has been some concern that the face masks used at school during the pandemic may be hurting younger children's development, but this research letter published in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that kids recognize emotions about as well as they could without masks. For this study, researchers from University Hospital Lausanne in Switzerland showed 90 pictures at random to nearly 300 children ages 3 to 6. The photos showed actors who expressed joy, anger or sadness. In half of the images, actors wore masks. They were asked to either name the emotion, point to a card showing emoticons with these emotions, tell the researcher that they didn't know the answer or say that they wanted to quit the experiment. The children got most of the answers right and were able to match the emotions to the picture on the card at a nearly identical rate, whether the figure was wearing a mask or not. Kids described the correct emotion more than 70% of the time when the actor was maskless and got it right more than 67% of the time when the figure wore a mask. The older the kids, the more answers they got correct. About a quarter of preschoolers had a harder time distinguishing sadness from anger and about 21% occasionally confused joy for anger or sadness. ""Actual face masks depicted in static pictures were significantly associated with emotion recognition in healthy preschool children, although differences were small and effect sizes were weak,"" the study said. Ashley Ruba, a developmental psychology expert in the Child Emotion Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison, was not affiliated with this study, but has done similar work during the pandemic. She said she saw similar results with her work. ""Even with masks being worn, little kids can probably still make reasonable inferences about other people's emotions,"" Ruba said. ""I like to point out that the face isn't the most important way we communicate our emotions, it is only one way. We also use tone of voice, we have body posture, we have other kinds of contextual clues that kids and adults can use to figure out how people are feeling."" For language processing, it is important for kids to learn to lip read, but it's clear from the research, she said, that a mask is not going to hurt a child's development. ""The risks of contracting Covid from not wearing a mask are probably going to outweigh any slight issue about communication that kids might have,"" she said. As a developmental psychologist, she thinks there are many more aspects of the pandemic that could hurt a child's development, like from the social isolation they've had from peers when they've had to stay at home from school or if a parent were to lose a job, for example. ""Masks are probably at the bottom of the list of things to be concerned about,"" she said.","Little kids can likely read your emotions even when you wear a face mask, study finds"

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/14/health/mask-covid-19-safety-vaccine-wellness/index.html,"CNN Shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine are arriving, with While these developments mark a historic moment and hold much promise, that doesn't mean Americans can stop wearing masks anytime soon. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, explains why.   Here's what the studies don't yet show. They haven't looked at whether the vaccine prevents someone from carrying Covid-19 and spreading it to others. It's possible that someone could get the vaccine but could still be an asymptomatic carrier. They may not show symptoms, but they have the virus in their nasal passageway so that if they're speaking, breathing, sneezing and so on, they can still transmit it to others. This is the main reason why we can't stop wearing masks right after we get the vaccine. The vaccine will protect you from getting ill and then ending up hospitalized. But it's possible that you could still carry the virus and be contagious to others. So those who get the vaccine should still be wearing masks and practicing physical distancing.   This means about 230 million Americans must receive the vaccine. It will take time to produce this many vaccines -- and remember the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are two-dose vaccines, so you need double the number of doses as people. Then the vaccine must be distributed and actually given to people. If all goes well, the best estimates are that it will be late spring or early summer for most Americans to receive the vaccine. At that point, we could probably see one another without masks -- but not before.   How quickly we reach herd immunity will depend on production, distribution and the willingness of the American people to take the vaccine. There is a concern that many Americans may not take the vaccine even if it's available. We need to have a thoughtful public education campaign that's tailored to different communities. And we need everyone's help! When it's your turn, please take the vaccine. Help spread the word and convince your family and friends about the importance of the vaccine to saving lives and ending this pandemic.   That's also why we keep wearing masks, too. We do it to protect ourselves, and to protect others. Remember that even after we get the vaccine, we can spread the virus to others. Also, the vaccine is very effective but it isn't 100%. The mask still protects you, too.   It's very important to prevent the virus from reaching your body in the first place. Wearing a mask does that. So does physical distancing. These are really important measures to prevent from getting coronavirus and transmitting it to others. You will certainly see mask wearing among health care workers, who will be among the first groups to get the vaccine. The vaccine is one important layer of protection for us, but we will use these other measures to protect ourselves and those around us.   We need for everyone to keep following the precautions we've been talking about all along: Wear a mask. Keep physical distancing. Avoid indoor gatherings. Wash your hands. I'll add one more: Get the vaccine when it's your turn. We can get through this winter, and the spring and summer hold so much promise.",Why a Covid-19 vaccine doesn't mean that you can stop wearing a mask
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/29/health/booster-eligibility-analysis/index.html,"CNN If you're vaccinated against Covid-19 and wondering if you're eligible for a booster shot, the answer is probably yes. After months of debate about who should be eligible for a booster, an analysis done for CNN shows that at least 89% of vaccinated American adults are eligible once enough time has passed since their original shots. This might surprise many Americans who think you have to be elderly or seriously ill to qualify for a booster shot. It even surprised some government vaccine advisers. ""That's even more than I thought,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a member of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. ""I would have thought it was something like half the population."" The data analysis was done by the Computational Epidemiology Lab at Boston Children's Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. The group also powers Adults who received Pfizer or Moderna's Covid-19 vaccines are eligible for boosters once they are six months past their second shot, as long as they are age 65 or older or are at high risk for severe Covid-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has Nearly 75% of people age 20 and over are overweight, according to the 'Boosterpalooza' For Schaffner, this high percentage was surprising, but not necessarily bad. At several government vaccine advisers' meetings over the past six weeks, the discussion centered on people at high risk for severe Covid-19 without listing every medical condition that fit into that category. He says he and his fellow advisers weren't thinking of conditions such as being overweight or depressed that affect such a large proportion of Americans. ""People were focused on classical underlying conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes - I think that was principally the mindset of my colleagues,"" said Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Overweight has been on CDC's high-risk list since March, and mental health conditions were added in mid-October, according to Kristen Nordlund, an agency spokesperson. Schaffner said he feels like there has been ""booster creep,"" but he doesn't necessarily mind it. ""One of my vaccine adages is better to over-immunize than to under-immunize even a few,"" he said. But Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel, called the current situation ""boosterpalooza"" and ""third-dose fever,"" noting that doses being given as boosters in the US could be sent overseas to places with vaccine shortages. ""I agreed that those over 65 benefit from boosters and then it just opened the door,"" he said. ""We've created this monster."" On August 18, more than a month before the FDA ""The administration got what it wanted,"" Offit said. ""To be perfectly honest, I think this was shoved down our throats."" Spokespersons for the White House and the US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request from CNN to respond to Offit's remarks. Data analysis To do the analysis, the epidemiology team at Boston Children's Hospital looked at the The team then looked at the number of people in high-risk jobs and the prevalence in the United States of several of those medical conditions, such as being overweight or obese, smoking, asthma and having mood disorders such as depression. They statistically accounted for the fact that some people fall into more than one of these categories. The epidemiologists also included in the analysis the relatively small group of Americans who received Johnson & Johnson's single-shot vaccine - 15 million people compared with 175 million for Pfizer and Moderna. Everyone who received the J&J vaccine is eligible as long as they are at least two months past their original shot. Taking all of this into account, the epidemiologists estimated that at least 89% of those who pass the time requirements are eligible for a booster. They say it's likely even more than that, since elderly people, workers in high-risk jobs and those with underlying conditions are more likely to be vaccinated than other Americans. Confusion about boosters Many Americans are confused about whether they are eligible for a booster shot, according to a In a survey of 13,443 vaccinated US adults conducted October 4-10, more than 1 in 4 said they were not sure if they qualified for a booster. The rates were higher for minority groups: 31% of Blacks, 33% of Hispanics and 35% of Asians said they were unsure about their eligibility. In a Kaiser Family Foundation ""There's a lot of confusion about who qualifies,"" said Benjamin Rader, a graduate research fellow with the Boston Children's Hospital team. ""I think there's been a lot of bombarding people with information and it's hard to keep up with information coming from multiple sources at different times."" In describing who is Everyone who received Johnson & Johnson should receive a booster if they are two months or more past their original shot, the agency says. For Pfizer and Moderna recipients, those who are 65 years and older, ages 50 to 64 with underlying medical conditions and ages 18 and older who live in long-term care settings should receive a booster if they are six months or more past their second shot. For other eligible people, it's ""based on their individual risks and benefits,"" according to the CDC: Pfizer and Moderna recipients who are six months or more past their second shot may receive a booster shot if they are ages 18 to 49 and have an underlying medical condition. ""The difference between should and may is a pretty important distinction,"" said Dr. Grace Lee, a member of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee and a pediatrician at the Stanford University School of Medicine. ""When you're in the 'may' category, you have to look at what applies to your individual situation."" She said there are details and nuances in the CDC's guidance. ""This is the most complex set of recommendations we've had to give,"" Lee said. ""I can see 100% why this is confusing to the general public."" Do the booster rules even matter? There's a bigger question about the CDC booster guidelines: Do they even matter? To get a booster at The government vaccine advisers are aware that people might not follow the rules. ""People of education and wealth and ability are going to find some reason, they're going to a provider, a pharmacy probably,"" that isn't careful about the rules, Dr. Sarah Long, a pediatrician at Drexel University College of Medicine said at a September 23 meeting of the CDC vaccine advisory committee. ""They'll get their dose without really significant need."" ""People are just going to go and get vaccines without any reason, and for lack of a better term, misrepresent their underlying conditions, just to get a booster,"" Dr. Jason Goldman, another committee member, said at the same meeting.",At least 89% of vaccinated American adults will qualify for Covid-19 booster shots

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/12/politics/larry-summers-economic-signals/index.html,"CNN Making sense of today's confusing economic signals is difficult. The eminent Democratic economist has done it all year. Yet Summers also says Congress should pass Biden's $1.9 trillion Build Back Better Plan over GOP opposition because it would boost long-term growth without significantly increasing inflation. Democratic leaders have crossed their fingers that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin listens. Lately, economic data offers cross-cutting superlatives nearly every day. Last week, Summers, a former top economic adviser to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, sees neither unalloyed prosperity nor dangerous decline. Instead, he acknowledges immense uncertainty that allows for either outcome or something in between. The inflation spike Summers sounded But the economy has also shown important strengths in its recovery from the coronavirus calamity. The Federal Reserve projects 2021 growth at 5.9%, the highest since 1984, as the US became the first advanced industrial economy to return output to pre-pandemic levels. Employers have added 6 million jobs, more than in any other president's first year. Unemployment has fallen to 4.2% three years before economists previously expected. Covid relief checks have boosted household income higher than before coronavirus. Even the thorniest immediate problems - supply chain kinks and high oil prices - have begun easing. Summers acknowledges that the rescue plan he criticized has lifted growth and employment. And though workers' wages overall have lost ground to inflation, wages of lower-paid workers have run ahead - a small step toward the Democratic goal of curbing income inequality. But he fears sustained inflation will render those gains fleeting. The tighter monetary policy the Federal Reserve has signaled to cool the economy could have unpredictable and painful effects. ""The economy would be weaker right now"" without Biden's rescue plan, Summers conceded in an interview. ""If I drive 90 mph, I will get to New York faster. But I'm at higher risk of crashing. ""We're going to have to slow the car in a controlled way,"" he added. ""It may not be so easy."" Currently, Summers pegs chances at 50% that inflation will settle in at perhaps twice the Fed's 2% target - for years. If the problem snowballs anything like it did in the 1970s, when expectations of higher prices became self-fulfilling, taming it could force an excruciating downturn. Summers sees a 30% chance that Fed tightening will trigger another recession, just three years from the last one, within the next 18 months. His least likely scenario - a 20% chance - is that the Federal Reserve pumps the brakes skillfully enough that demand and supply resolve imbalances harmoniously enough to sustain growth. White House economists, and some on Wall Street, paint a more hopeful picture. It begins with vaccinations taming the pandemic and tempering inflation in multiple ways: by reducing Covid-related production bottlenecks, drawing more workers to the labor force, shifting consumption back toward services and away from goods as normal life returns. As supply expands, the end of Covid relief will moderate demand. Summers calls that too sanguine. To begin with, the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus underscores the possibility that the pandemic may resist taming indefinitely. Moreover, Summers notes that the earnings of those returning workers will themselves increase demand. So will spending by Americans who so far have saved big chunks of those relief checks. ""The notion that the end of the pandemic is going to be inherently deflationary is a confusion,"" Summers said. The steps he recommends to reduce inflation risks lack political appeal. One is eliminating the full or partial restoration of federal deductions for state and local income taxes - which House Democrats say has become essential to amassing the votes for Biden's Build Back Better bill. Another is adding more tax hikes on corporations - which Senate Democrats fear would also sink the bill by losing the vote of Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. A third is lifting import tariffs on China - which for foreign policy and domestic political reasons Biden won't do anytime soon. Summers allows that economic good fortune could render his warnings overblown. ""I don't want to over-argue my case,"" he said. Maybe Americans have grown so accustomed to low inflation that behavior-altering ""inflation expectations"" won't take off. Maybe new remote-work arrangements forced by the pandemic will produce efficiency gains as technological advances did in the 1990s. Even such a ""soft landing"" may not save Democrats next year, since voter attitudes rarely improve as fast as the economy itself. What has lifted struggling presidents before are foreign policy crises or other unexpected events that quickly reframe the political agenda. ""The picture,"" Summers observed, ""is a long way from frozen.""",How Larry Summers makes sense of confusing economic signals
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/08/health/pfizer-omicron-vaccine-data/index.html,"CNN Preliminary lab studies show two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may not provide sufficient protection against the Omicron coronavirus variant, but three doses are able to neutralize it, the companies said in a Samples from people who had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine saw, on average, a more than 25-fold reduction in neutralization ability against the Omicron variant than the earlier virus, ""indicating that two doses of BNT162b2 may not be sufficient to protect against infection with the Omicron variant,"" the companies said. The companies said two doses may still provide protection against severe disease. ""Although two doses of the vaccine may still offer protection against severe disease caused by the Omicron strain, it's clear from these preliminary data that protection is improved with a third dose of our vaccine,"" Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. ""Ensuring as many people as possible are fully vaccinated with the first two dose series and a booster remains the best course of action to prevent the spread of COVID-19."" The initial lab studies used serum from blood from individuals who received two or three doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The sera was collected from subjects three weeks after their second dose, or one month after a third dose. The data released Wednesday has not been peer-reviewed or published. ""We believe that with the two doses, you still have relevant protection for severe disease, but clearly the drop is antibodies is substantial,"" Dr. Mikael Dolsten, chief scientific officer at Pfizer, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Wednesday. ""However, the good news this morning is that our data show convincingly when you get your boost - the third boost - the antibody levels rise 25 fold and are now similar to the originally two dose boost that protected well against ancestral strains as well as Delta. ""Go and get your third boost and you have a robust, quite impressive antibody response as well as a strengthening of the other arm of the immune system, the T cells,"" Dolsten said. ""That's really the takeaway ... two doses is on the weak end against this new variant, T cells may help you to be protected against severe disease, hospitalization - but it's really time to get the third boost."" President Joe Biden called the preliminary results ""very, very encouraging."" ""I have some good news this morning that Pfizer's lab report came back saying that the expectation is that the existing vaccines protect against Omicron but if you get the booster you're really in good shape. So that's very encouraging news,"" Biden told reporters on the South Lawn Wednesday. ""That's the lab report. There's more studies going on but that's very, very encouraging."" Another study, released Tuesday by researchers in South Africa, showed the Omicron coronavirus variant partly escapes the protection offered by the Pfizer vaccine. The ""My impression is if you get a booster you are protected, especially against severe disease,"" Sigal said. Since reports of the Omicron variant emerged in late November, US health officials have urged people to get vaccinated and boosted. Last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending all adults get a Covid-19 vaccine booster. Adults who have had the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines are eligible to get a booster six months after their second shot. Those who got the Johnson & Johnson one-shot vaccine are eligible for a booster of any authorized vaccine two months after their first dose. About a quarter of adults who are vaccinated against Covid-19 have also received a booster dose, according to CDC data. More than 144 million adults should get a booster, based on CDC guidance, but only about 48 million adults have received one. Pfizer and BioNTech also said Wednesday they are continuing to develop a variant-specific vaccine for Omicron and it will be available by March, if it's needed. ""I'm not sure that we'll need it because it's one very likely scenario that the current booster will be enough to maintain protection, but if we need one, I'm sure we can make one and the good news is that we will have it by March,"" Bourla said on NBC's ""Today"" show on Wednesday.","Protection against Omicron coronavirus variant improves with three vaccine doses, Pfizer says"

On Wednesday, The finding was not surprising to Dr. Leana Wen, emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. ""The data from Pfizer out this morning are not surprising. Actually, this is what we have been anticipating all along, that there's good news and bad news - the bad news being that there's some degree of immune escape, that two doses may not work as well as against previous variants. But I actually think that's really good news that the third dose does appear to give that really significant additional boosting effect,"" Wen, a CNN medical analyst, told CNN's Ana Cabrera on Wednesday. ""So, it adds more reason for everybody to get a booster, certainly who's eligible,"" Wen said. ""But also I do hope that our federal health officials will be quick to reevaluate the definition of what it means to be fully vaccinated, especially in light of what we're learning about Omicron."" The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention On Thursday, the Vaccine makers have known for months now that the Two separate studies from israel published Wednesday showed booster doses of Pfizer/BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine The two studies, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, look at the effects of Israel's campaign to offer boosters to everyone 12 and older with the spread of the Delta variant in the summer. While deaths and severe cases were low among fully vaccinated people, booster shots lowered them dramatically more. It's more evidence that boosters not only restore waning immunity, but improve protection against emerging coronavirus variants. The evidence has led some to suggest that the definition of being fully vaccinated should shift from completing two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to having completed three. What counts as fully vaccinated now? The primary series of receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine should be considered a three-dose series rather than a two-dose series plus booster, Ugur Sahin, CEO of German biotechnology company BioNTech, said during a news conference Wednesday. ""Particularly with the data now coming for the Omicron variant, it is very clear our vaccine - for the Omicron variant - should be a three-dose vaccine,"" Sahin said. Pfizer and BioNTech are working to develop a variant-specific vaccine for Omicron and say it will be available by March, if needed. But Sahin said even though an Omicron-specific vaccine is being developed, people who are eligible to receive booster shots now should not wait. Since the benefit of a third coronavirus vaccine dose has become more clear in the scientific data, some public health experts have asked whether the US definition of what it means to be fully vaccinated should change - while others call it a ""large leap"" to change the definition. Currently, the CDC considers people to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 two weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or two weeks after a single shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. CNN has contacted the CDC for comment on updating that definition. ""I think that going from the hard science - which is so encouraging, I'm so glad to hear that information from Pfizer - to public policy and redefining what's vaccinated, that's a large leap. Let's not make things more complicated than they are at the present time,"" Dr. William Schaffner, chair of the department of preventative medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and liaison to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, told CNN's Victor Blackwell and Alisyn Camerota on Wednesday. ""Changing the requirements of what fully vaccinated means, I think, has all kinds of downstream effects for all kinds of institutions in the country,"" he said. ""I don't think we're quite there yet."" But it's a matter now ""of when, not if"" the definition of fully vaccinated will change to include three doses, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday. ""It's a technical, almost semantic definition, and it is the definition for requirements if someone says, 'Are you fully vaccinated?' to be able to attend class in a university or a college or be able to work in a workplace,"" Fauci told CNN's Kate Bolduan. He added that he doesn't see the definition changing ""tomorrow or next week."" But in terms of the protection that a booster dose provides, ""I don't think anybody would argue that optimal protection is going to be with a third shot. Whether or not it officially gets changed in the definition, I think that's going to be considered literally on a daily basis. That's always on the table,"" Fauci said. ""It's going to be a matter of when, not if."" Currently, only about a quarter - 25.9% - of fully vaccinated adults in the United States have received a booster dose of coronavirus vaccine, according to data from the CDC. That percentage is an uptick from the share of vaccinated adults who were boosted a month ago. The pace of vaccinations is rising quickly after a dip over the Thanksgiving holiday. An average of more than 950,000 booster doses have been reported administered each day over the past week, accounting for more than half of all vaccine doses administered, according to CDC data. But there is still room for improvement on vaccine uptake. Based on CDC guidance, more than 144 million adults should get a booster. So far, only about 48 million adults have received one. While boosters roll out in the United States, in other parts of the world the focus remains on getting first doses of vaccines into arms - so much so that the World Health Organization has warned against putting too much emphasis on booster shots. A global call to vaccinate the unvaccinated Initial rounds of vaccination against Covid-19 are still important to fight the spread of the virus, WHO Chief Scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said in a news briefing Wednesday. ""I think the message is loud and clear, that it's the primary course of vaccination that is going to protect against severe disease and death. That has to be our goal,"" Swaminathan said in a media briefing. She added that WHO has recommended additional vaccine doses for people who are immunocompromised. But among the general public, ""unfortunately, even in countries that have adequate supplies or more than adequate supplies, there is still a substantial proportion of people who have not been vaccinated - 30%, 40%, 50% complete the course of vaccination,"" Swaminathan said. ""So, the boosters, unfortunately, are probably not the solution to this,"" she said. ""At this point, the benefits that we will get from reaching those people who have not received primary courses of vaccination are going to be higher than giving additional doses to those who've already completed a primary course.""",Mounting evidence highlights the importance of Covid-19 boosters
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/02/health/covid-19-vaccine-second-doses-debate-explainer-wellness/index.html,"CNN To help speed up Covid-19 vaccinations across the United States, especially among high-risk older adults, one idea continues to surface: Postpone second doses. The idea is that delaying second doses for those who have already received a first dose would allow for more people in prioritized groups to get at least one dose if they haven't received it already. ""We get down the list faster if we do all those first doses,"" Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the ""My view is that the weight of the evidence suggests that we would probably save more lives by delaying second doses than by insisting on the schedule that was tested in the trials,"" he said. Yet not all experts agree that changing dosing schedules is a good idea. ""We have two problems with that. The first - they may not get fully protected and that might accelerate the rate of variants taking over and causing us much more trouble in the future,"" William Haseltine, chair and president of the global think tank ""Secondly, we really don't know if delaying the second dose for a long time is going to give you the same degree of protection,"" he said. In other words, there's not much research as Covid-19 vaccines were developed only recently. Meanwhile, as debates around delaying second doses continue in the United States, so do a slow vaccine rollout, more Covid-19 deaths and the spread of newly identified coronavirus variants that appear to be more transmissible. Getting second doses is priority, but 'there is some wiggle room' It is still recommended for people to get their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine on time, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a virtual White House briefing on Monday. ""Until we have further data,"" Walensky said, people should continue to follow the data from trials by continuing the schedule of receiving two doses 21 days apart for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 28 days apart for the Moderna vaccine. Those are the two vaccines currently authorized for emergency use in the United States. ""The policy is that we certainly want everyone who gets a first dose to get their second dose,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to President Biden and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during Monday's briefing. But also on Monday, during a meeting of the International AIDS Society, Fauci said that if you're late by just a couple of weeks there isn't a cause for concern. ""There is some wiggle room,"" he said. ""It's not the end of the world if you delay a little bit. If you want to delay it by six months, that's different."" Delaying second doses would go against the vaccine schedules that have been authorized under the US Food and Drug Administration. In January, the CNN confirmed with the FDA in January that if a manufacturer requests a change to its emergency use authorization, the manufacturer would need to submit data to the FDA supporting the requested change. Some experts argue that there is evidence to support a possible change. 'We need to have a really comprehensive review and discussion of this' Lipsitch of Harvard University is in favor of spreading out vaccine doses in a larger population rather than doubling doses for half of that population. ""If you can get at least half the benefit, then it's better to spread it out,"" he said. For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, called BNT162b2, data suggest that the vaccine has 52% efficacy after just one dose and then provides 95% protection against Covid-19 after two doses. In a Phase 3 trial that was conducted at 99 sites in the United States, data suggest that Moderna's vaccine But trials haven't been conducted to test single doses of mRNA vaccines. Some For many other vaccines - such as the chickenpox, HPV and measles, mumps and rubella vaccines - their second-dose booster shots are given several months later, Michael Osterholm, director of the ""At this point, everything we know about vaccines suggests that actually the protection may be enhanced by giving a booster several months after the first dose,"" said Osterholm, who was a coronavirus adviser to the Biden transition team. Osterholm pointed to a letter-to-the-editor that The researchers hypothesized, ""suppose that 1 million people are to be vaccinated but only 1 million doses are available. If two doses are given to each vaccinee and the efficacy is 95%, 475,000 people will be protected. If single doses are given and the efficacy is 80%, 800,000 people will be protected."" Osterholm said that getting people vaccinated - even with just one dose for now - remains urgent as more ""We need to have a really comprehensive review and discussion of this as quickly as possible because you know this new variant B.1.1.7 could cause a surge in our cases within weeks,"" Osterholm said. He described the emergence of these variants as similar to a hurricane approaching on the horizon. ""I feel like I'm sitting here on a beautiful beach - the light breeze, perfectly blue skies and everybody - and I'm telling them to start to evacuate. People are saying, 'Are you crazy?' But I see that 450 miles south, there's a category five hurricane,"" Osterholm said. ""That's the challenge. How do you get people to take action?"" Other experts, however, argue that having a longer period of time between vaccine doses could come with the risk of being more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus and its variants. Overall, Fauci said on Monday that getting vaccinated against Covid-19 can help prevent more coronavirus variants from emerging in the future. ""You need to get vaccinated when it becomes available as quickly and as expeditiously as possible,"" Fauci said during Monday's White House briefing, adding that viruses cannot mutate if they don't replicate. White House concerned about providers holding back doses The Biden administration expressed concern on Monday that health care providers could essentially be hoarding Covid-19 vaccine doses for second shots that could be administered for initial shots. ""We believe that some health care providers are regularly holding back doses that are intended as first doses, and instead keeping them in reserve for second doses for patients,"" Andy Slavitt, As of Monday, nearly 50 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have been distributed across the United States and about 32 million doses have been administered so far, CDC data show that about 26 million people have received at least one dose so far - but, among them, nearly 6 million have received their two doses. ""On January 20, states had administered 46% of their inventory. Today, that number is 62%. We are focused on this every hour of every day,"" Slavitt said on Monday. Slavitt suggested that in some cases, patients' appointments for a first dose are being canceled and pressed the urgency in getting first doses out as quickly as possible. He said the administration's move last week to provide a three-week window into vaccine shipping plans was meant to allay concerns that second doses could get held up.",Experts split on delaying Covid-19 vaccine second doses.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/19/opinions/build-back-better-biden-messaging-zelizer/index.html,"CNN President Joe Biden is getting closer to another major victory in what could be a legislative hat trick to round out his first year in office. After House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy delayed a vote in the lower chamber with an eight-hour speech last night, Democrats passed the Build Back Better Act, which is now expected to Democrats, who have a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber, will have to see if they can get Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema on board. Although the Congressional Budget Office issued a better-than-expected score which should help ease any reservations the two moderate senators might have about the overall cost, it is still far from clear whether Democrats can seal the deal. Passing the legislation would count as a landmark achievement. The $1.9 trillion bill would drastically expand the social safety net and help fight climate change by providing subsidies for health care and childcare, free and universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with new tax credits for clean energy, investments in electric vehicles, and funding for environmental conservation. The bill will would also allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for older Americans on Medicare, provide new and improved affordable housing, include subsidies to make high-speed internet more accessible - and more. If the legislation passes, Biden will be able to tout the Build Back Better Act, the American Rescue Plan and the $1 trillion infrastructure bill to join the ranks of the few Democrats since FDR who have been able to expand the role of the federal government in American life. In a sharp rebuke of Reaganism, Biden is building on the liberal legacy that stipulates government is essential to a healthy and equitable marketplace. There are many reasons why President Biden has struggled politically in recent months. When it comes to the administration's problems with messaging, its reticence may be an overcorrection after the Trump era. Given that so many Americans grew tired of the onslaught of tweets, announcements and reports covering the turbulence in the White House under Trump, Biden may have initially chosen to step back from the limelight, working behind closed doors to try to focus on the challenges of governing. This strategy proved to be effective at the start of Biden's presidency, since it created the perception that the federal government was operating smoothly. But when pushing for big legislative initiatives, telling stories is part of what presidents do. Whenever the great Democratic presidents have successfully expanded the role of our government, they sold these laws to the American people as a way to address the major concerns of the day. Franklin Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" was an effort to address one of the worst economic crises in US history, offering workers and farmers a new social safety net that would ensure the bottom would not again fall out for average Americans. Lyndon B. Johnson's ""Great Society"" was an effort to use the growing wealth of this country to make the nation better than it had ever been by grappling with perennial challenges of poverty, racism, and inadequate education. It wasn't just that Roosevelt or Johnson had pithy catchphrases--those alone, as Harry Truman learned with the ""Fair Deal"" are not enough to guarantee success. It was the ability of these presidents to connect the dots between their proposals and the most pertinent concerns of the era in order to make a compelling case to the American people that these legislative packages were critical to the country's future. For Americans in 2021, nothing comes close to the pandemic and the problems it exposed and exacerbated. The nation and the world, lived through one of the most traumatic and unsettling crises of recent decades. Covid-19 ravaged the world and inflicted an enormous death toll while upending our way of life, widening racial and economic disparities, and inflicting a psychological toll that could have a lasting impact on people for years to come. While we are all focused on returning to some semblance of normality as soon as possible, the notion that we can simply move on or that the damage of the pandemic can easily be undone is shortsighted. Joe Biden won the 2020 election over Donald Trump for many reasons, one of which was a desperate desire for efficient and coherent leadership that could help us all climb out of the desperate state the pandemic put us in. As Biden tries to push his capstone legislation toward final passage by Christmas, he has to come back to this basic concern. Too often, Biden has not done enough to explain how his legislative push is as integral to our country's recovery as the vaccine rollout. In the last few days, the administration has finally started to push back against inflation hawks by explaining how the infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better package would actually reduce basic costs for American families. But he needs to do more by laying out what's in these bills and how they'll make a positive impact on millions of Americans. Lowering the cost of health care and child care while providing support for caregiving jobs, for example, addresses longstanding problems that came to the forefront during the pandemic. More aggressive efforts to deal with climate change is also part of how we avoid another global crisis from unfolding. The more Biden can do to explain how his agenda addresses the Covid-19 pandemic and how his policies will make us more resilient going forward, the more pressure he can exert on Senators Manchin and Sinema to finally join the rest of their party in moving forward with this historic legislation.",What 'BBB' really means

The median time between completing their initial second dose of vaccine and receiving a booster or placebo was about 11 months, the companies said.

Alexander is a whistleblower. He sacrificed his military career when he Andrei is a dissident. He resigned from the Belarusian government in 1996 in protest against the rising authoritarianism of President Alexander Lukashenko. In 2010, he dared to run against Lukashenko for President of Belarus. From our experiences, we have learned that when coming to democracy's defense, whistleblowers may pay with their careers, but dissidents often pay with their lives. In Alexander's case, independent media sought out the truth and Congress called on him to In Andrei's case, Lukashenko had him Although whistleblowers and dissidents play a critical role as truth seekers within society, our stories exemplify the sobering reality that we cannot effect change without additional support. Simply put, whistleblowers and dissidents can act as the catalysts for change, but it is the broader public that can alter the course of history. In the US, that knowledge and belief ebbs and flows. During moments of widespread grassroots mobilization and public outcry - including the Black Lives Matter An important fact to remember in this discussion is that these democratic demonstrations in the US have been This has been a critical element of the ongoing fight against anti-democratic forces, as well as a key feature of the American system, which has been flexible and resilient in responding to the will of the people during tumultuous periods. But the risk of political lethargy following the departure of former President Donald Trump is not something to be written off. Trump holds significant influence over the Republican Party - and Trumpism will undoubtedly American complacency has both short-term and long-term consequences. While in the short term, some proponents of the ""Big Lie"" could win elected office, significant danger lies in the long-term trends - namely the incremental replacement of more traditional politicians with Trumpian populists and conspiracy theorists. Three years from now, Trump could be the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, decrying another close election loss. But this time he could have the support of enough state Republican officials complying with his demands to overturn unfavorable election results. We cannot merely address these issues once they have already become realities, as was the case during the surge of civil activism under the Trump presidency. We must be proactive in stemming authoritarianism now. In Belarus, by contrast, the most brutal form of authoritarianism is already a fact of life. Protests are met with violence. Under the repressive Lukashenko regime, the last vestiges of democratic institutions within civil society are being Much like Andrei, Western governments have the tools and resources to exert increased pressure on Lukashenko and his officials. These governments can raise the costs of Lukashenko's repressions by Some, such as the The United States could take the lead on this, since it already fulfills an Given the current situation in Belarus, a prudent approach may be to provide financial, rhetorical, and organizational support to the leaders of the pro-democracy movement beyond the borders of the country. Critical figures, like Andrei, and organizations continue to strengthen and empower Belarusian civil society, even in exile. They facilitate a platform for the Belarusian opposition that provides hope for the future and offers a democratic alternative to the illegitimate Lukashenko regime. It is dangerous and irresponsible to believe that the US can abrogate its duties as the leader of the free world without consequences in the regions of the world where democracy is still struggling to establish a foothold. Belarusians, alongside countless other peoples, look to the US to set an example and represent an ideal worth striving for.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/30/health/omicron-variant-weeks-research/index.html,"CNN As soon as South Africa announced the spread of a new and troubling variant last week, scientists went to work. By the time the World Health Organization had named the new lineage Omicron, multiple teams of researchers had already duplicated the work of the laboratories in Durban and elsewhere, and mapped out the genetic changes that made Omicron the new bad actor of the coronavirus family. Although many of those mutations were familiar from other variants, scientists still were not sure whether they make Omicron substantially different from previous variants - especially the super-dominant Delta variant. It will take weeks of testing to tell what added superpowers, if any, these mutations give Omicron. Researchers will look at what's happening in the real world by testing samples taken from patients, sequencing their genomes to see if it's Omicron causing the infections, and looking to see if more and more samples turn out to be Omicron. They'll also watch to see if Omicron infections lead to more severe disease and if fully vaccinated people end up more likely to become infected with Omicron variants as opposed to other strains. That kind of in-real-life testing can take months. ""AstraZeneca is also already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified, namely in Botswana and Eswatini, that will enable us to collect real world data of Vaxzevria against this new virus variant,"" a spokesperson for the vaccine maker said Friday. Vaccine makers are turning to what's become a go-to technique throughout the pandemic - pulling blood from vaccinated volunteers and people who have recovered from recent infections and mixing it with samples of the new variant - or a lab-engineered version called a pseudovirus - to see how immune cells and proteins work against it. Blood serum contains the antibodies and the B cells and T cells that do the hard work of the body's immune system. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson all say they're starting these experiments. ""The Company is testing blood serum from participants in completed and ongoing booster studies to look for neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant,"" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement Monday. This approach has been used to demonstrate first that vaccines were likely to work to protect people against infection, then to show they Such lab-dish techniques, combined with real-life evidence, form the basis of decision making on vaccine authorizations, approvals and guidance on their use. And they'll be used to inform the world about the risks of Omicron. ""There's two ways we're going to figure this out,"" National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told CNN Monday. ""One is by laboratory experiments. To do that, you need to actually have an isolate of Omicron growing in the lab and then you mix that with serum from people who've been vaccinated and ask does that vaccinated serum still neutralize the virus. That just takes a while for the virus to be grown up. There's not a lot we could do to accelerate that."" World Health Organization Covid-19 Technical Lead Maria Van Kerkhove told CNN it will take some time to ""grow up the stock"" of the virus to do that. ""Our estimate is between two and four weeks,"" she said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, outlined the two approaches Tuesday. ""One of the things you do is you get the virus and you grow it or you put it into a modified form called a pseudovirus. And when you do that, you can then get convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, as well as sera and antibodies that are induced by the vaccine to see if they neutralize the virus,"" he told a White House coronavirus briefing. Convalescent plasma comes from people who have been infected and recovered. ""That will give you a pretty good idea as to what the level of immune evasion is. That process will take likely two weeks or more, perhaps even sooner, depending upon how well the virus grows in the isolates that we get,"" Fauci said. ""And in those countries in which there are a lot of cases like South Africa, the computational biologists and the evolutionary biologists are going to be getting a good feel as to what the competition of this virus would be with Delta. Those are just a few of the things that will take a couple of weeks to a few weeks to learn."" US Food and Drug Administration acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said in a statement Tuesday the agency is working with medical product companies - those making tests, therapeutics and vaccines - to address any potential effects of new variant. ""Historically, the work to obtain the genetic information and patient samples for variants and then perform the testing needed to evaluate their impact takes time. However, we expect the vast majority of this work to be completed in the coming weeks,"" Woodcock said.",Scientists say it will take weeks to tell how dangerous Omicron really is. Here's why

Tiny heads stick out of the back seat windows, tightly close their eyes and tilt back as the insides of their noses are swabbed for hints of coronavirus infection. For children who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 in one of Marietta City Schools' classrooms, early morning testing in a nearby church parking lot has become the routine - instead of quarantine. If the exposed students test negative and have no symptoms, they can continue going to school in person - offering some relief for parents who have been overwhelmed with remote schooling during the pandemic. If the exposed student tests positive, they must isolate at home. This approach is called ""In Marietta we have been tracking students who are testing positive through test-to-stay, and it's 3%,"" Grant Rivera, superintendent of Marietta City Schools in Georgia, told CNN on Monday. ""Three percent of our students who participate in test-to-stay test positive, which means we can keep 97% of them in class,"" Rivera said. ""That is a measure of success."" Under a traditional quarantine program, the 97% of students who tested negative would still stay at home from school. For its For example, one week in late September, 318 students and three staff members were eligible for test-to-stay over five days. In that time, 123 tests were performed. Six tests were positive and 117 were negative. ""I think for the foreseeable future, we will be out here every morning on a school day making sure that our kids have this option,"" Rivera said about test-to-stay. ""We're doing this in Marietta not because we have CDC or public health guidance. Quite candidly, we're doing it because we saw a model in another state,"" he said. ""So, for me as a superintendent who has been tasked to not only develop these solutions but to lead them, I want more guidance from public health based on today's data and today's dynamics."" CDC evaluates test-to-stay Federal public health officials have been meeting with states to discuss a potential ""test-to-stay"" strategy for schools, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week during a White House virtual coronavirus briefing. This type of policy would prioritize testing as a way to monitor students who may have been exposed to Covid-19, allowing students to continue to attend classes if they test negative rather than quarantine. But there are still many health experts who agree that In an email to CNN, CDC said it views test-to-stay as a ""promising practice"" and said it's ""working with multiple jurisdictions implementing test to stay to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy."" But it's not clear when that test-to-stay guidance could be available. While there are many different approaches to tracking and containing Covid-19 outbreaks in schools, at least three superintendents - Rivera; Michael Karner in Lake County, Illinois and Demetrus Liggins in Fayette County, Kentucky - have all adopted some form of test-to-stay programs in their school districts. Lake County, Illinois, has been one of the areas sharing data on test-to-stay programs with the CDC. Michael Karner, the regional superintendent of schools and a parent of two children, told CNN that test-to-stay programs have been successful at keeping kids in school safely, if other mitigation measures, such as wearing masks, are in place. ""This program has allowed us to test for in-school exposures - where in the past last year, if you remember, anybody who was a close contact was quarantined. The big things for us is there must be appropriate, layered mitigation, such as social distancing and mask-wearing,"" Karner said. ""If those are not being followed, then the test-to-stay program would not work for those close contacts."" Data from the test-to-stay program show that for Lake County, fewer than 2% of kids exposed to the coronavirus in classrooms convert to a positive case, Karner said. ""Last year we had lots of students - hundreds of students - quarantine just because they were close contacts. But this year, we found that we've been able to keep several hundred individuals that were contacts in schools, and we've also been able to get data with regards to exposure,"" Karner said. ""Based on all the data that we've gotten in Lake County, we found out that exposure in the classroom is not leading to conversion, which means we're not having many close contacts in the classroom. Most of the close contact situations that we've had with regards to exposure have been on the bus and in the lunchroom,"" he said. ""On the bus, they're very close. Sometimes kids don't wear their masks on the bus. And in the lunchroom, obviously, when students sometimes are sitting closer than the recommended social distancing, that's when we found it."" In Kentucky, Demetrus Liggins said that out of the 402 Covid-19 tests that his school district conducted so far through its test-to-stay pilot program, only four tests yielded positive results. ""We've also found for us that we've had very minimal students that - since we began this process on September 27 - have tested positive after returning to school on a normal basis. And there also is an opt-in option,"" Liggins said ""We still have some parents that choose to quarantine their students."" Karner and Liggins both emphasized that their school districts require masking for indoor activities, and that mitigation measure adds to the success of their test-to-stay programs. In a contrast, Rivera of Marietta City Schools recently announced that for his district, ""Marietta recently transitioned to a mask optional approach. The reason for that is several. First of all, we're seeing significant decline in community transmission. We're also seeing a decrease in community positivity rate. Additionally, we're seeing fewer epi-linked cases in our classrooms,"" Rivera said. ""So for us, I don't believe that public health protocol should be static. We have to make sure that our protocols evolve with the data."" The What the science says As researchers and public health experts continue to examine the data around test-to-stay programs, two studies typically emerge in discussions: one out of Utah and the other out of the United Kingdom. The The study, Under test-to-play, students were tested for Covid-19 every two weeks in order to be allowed to continue extracurricular activities. In test-to-stay, school-wide testing was implemented in response to Covid-19 outbreaks, as opposed to a switch to remote instruction. Researchers credited the test-to-play program with preserving 95% of planned athletic events. A separate study conducted in England, ""They found no statistically significant difference between the Covid-19 rates in schools which did implement test-to-stay and those which implemented a more traditional quarantine,"" said Dr. Meagan Fitzpatrick, an infectious disease transmission modeler and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland, who was not involved in the study. ""This is also supported by modeling work that my group has done, as well as others have done."" 'It should be less controversial than it is' Fitzpatrick acknowledged that test-to-stay is a ""controversial"" approach. ""I think, in my expert opinion, that it should be less controversial than it is,"" she said. ""But I definitely understand why people hesitate and why people are looking for a firmer research basis for the test-to-stay program."" In March, the But even with the funding for tests made available in some places, many schools may not have the necessary personnel - such as school nurses or other staff members - to organize and coordinate such a large testing operation. As the CDC continues to evaluate test-to-stay programs, the logistics and resources needed to implement such an approach likely will be a serious part of conversations. ""The number-one difficulty that I have heard, when I discuss these test-to-stay programs here in Maryland, is personnel,"" Fitzpatrick said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/27/health/covid-vaccine-child-size-dose-wellness/index.html,"CNN The Pfizer/BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine just authorized for younger children still requires two shots given on the same schedule as the vaccine for adolescents and adults - but the doses will be a third of the size. For 5- to 11-year-olds, US Food and Drug Administration authorized a 10-microgram dose; the dose used for people 12 years and older is 30 micrograms. So why is there a difference? And what should parents of 11-year-olds do, especially if the child is approaching 12? Finding the right dosage One ""We think that we have optimized immune response and minimized reactions,"" Pfizer Senior Vice President Dr. William Gruber told the FDA's vaccine advisers' Tuesday about the company's Covid-19 vaccine for younger children. It's not about the size of the child. Rather, it's that little kids are still developing, and the immune system weakens with age. ""Kids actually tend to have very robust immune responses,"" said Dr. Kari Simonsen who has been leading the trial of the Pfizer vaccine at Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. ""In some cases, they can actually create strong responses to smaller amounts of vaccine antigen."" For some vaccines, adult and child doses can be the same, but in other cases, like with the hepatitis A vaccine, adults get a higher dose than children. ""As we are fond of saying in pediatrics: Children are not small adults. Children are children,"" said Dr. James Versalovic, Texas Children's Hospital interim pediatrician-in-chief. ""Their bodies are developing and will react differently, and we need to treat them differently."" That was a consideration as Pfizer tested vaccines in younger children. ""We took a step back after we did the adolescents, and we looked at the dosing, because we thought that we may be able to use a lower dose and be able to get the same immune response,"" said Dr. Bob Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. After testing, ""we got just as good an immune response as the 30-microgram dose and there were less side effects."" According to data from a Phase 2/3 trial Pfizer submitted in September, the two-dose, 10-microgram vaccine generated a ""robust"" antibody response in younger children. In a At higher doses tested in the trials, scientist saw a few more minor side effects, nothing severe. With the 10-microgram dose, researchers saw fewer issues with chills and fever than they saw in the 16- to 25-year age group that was tested. The lower dose should also reduce the theoretical risk of myocarditis, the inflammation of the heart muscle that has been seen in a small number of people after they got the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. No cases of myocarditis were seen in the younger children in the trial, but not enough children were tested to show whether they are also at risk. Scientists will be watching for cases closely. ""It is reassuring to me that we are giving a lower dose,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the independent FDA vaccine committee who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Should an almost-12-year-old wait for a larger dose? Some parents of 11-year-olds may be wondering if they should wait to get the higher dose shot, but ""If I had a family member in that situation, I would advise them just to get the dose that's authorized for their current age,"" Wiedermann said. ""I think we still have reasonable risk that we're going to see cases start to increase again sometime in the next few months."" Pfizer's Gruber said dose levels for 12- to-15-years old could be reduced at some point, but there's no data yet to support such a change. Earlier research showed this age group had a higher antibody response with the 30-microgram dose. ""We are thinking about that as a potential option, particularly as we move out of the pandemic period,"" Gruber said, referring to consideration of a smaller dose. ""The key goal right now is obviously providing protection with a safe and effective vaccine."" Wiedermann said doctors should not take that idea and run with it now for 12- to 15-year-olds. ""I've been telling our providers you should always stay within the lines when you're coloring,"" Wiedermann said. ""The immune response for this virus is very complex. A practitioner might think, whether it's giving a higher dose or a lower dose, that they're helping a particular child, but if it hasn't been studied don't do it, because we really don't know what the effects of that will be. This is not the time to be messing with anything outside of what's been authorized."" What happens next? On Friday, the Next, the CDC's independent vaccine advisory committee meets November 2, and will vote on whether to recommend it for use. Finally, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky will decide whether to accept or modify the CDC committee's recommendation. Once a recommendation is final, younger children could start getting vaccinated immediately. Some 28 million children would be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, and plans are already underway to help them get it. Getting this group vaccinated could get the country a step closer to ending the pandemic, experts have said. ""If we can create a situation where more of these kids are not getting infected, we should be able to drive this pandemic down, which is what we really hope to do even as we face the cold weather and other concerns about whether we might see another surge,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said on ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday.

So, I personally just thought that I was just exhausted from doing a lot of walking, not a lot of sleep, eating pretty poorly,"" McGinn said. ""I thought that was all just catching up to me."" McGinn didn't think twice about his fatigue until he returned home to Minnesota on November 22. Later that day he received a group text from someone he spent time with in New York. They texted to the group that they had Covid-19. McGinn took a rapid at-home test the next day. He tested positive. ""I had such mild symptoms."" McGinn said. ""If it wasn't for somebody in my party alerting me that they tested positive, I honestly would have thought I had a cold."" McGinn's Covid-19 diagnosis was confirmed with a PCR test and lab results revealed that he was infected with the newly identified Omicron coronavirus variant. He now wants to be a ""resource"" for the public and public health, and emphasizes that if he wasn't fully vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine and boosted with a Moderna booster dose that he could have had a more severe illness. ""The main reason why I wanted to speak out and be a resource was because of the unknown of the new variant,"" McGinn said. ""I've been working with the Minnesota Department of Health in terms of contact tracing with the contacts I was with in New York City."" Among the 30 people that McGinn said he spent time with in New York, 15 total - including him - tested positive for Covid-19, and they all had mild symptoms except for one who McGinn said ""had a bad day"" but did not require hospitalization. Only one person, other than McGinn, has been confirmed to be infected with the Omicron variant, but McGinn said that when he spoke with health officials they told him it's overwhelmingly likely that everyone who tested positive probably was infected with Omicron.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/31/economy/china-economy-coronavirus/index.html,"CNN Business China may have to cut taxes, boost spending and slash interest rates to prevent the The economic impact of the virus is still impossible to determine, but one state media outlet and some economists have said that China's growth rate could drop two percentage points this quarter because of the outbreak, which has brought large parts of the country to a standstill.  A decline on that scale could mean $62 billion in lost growth. China can ill afford that kind of hit. Growth last year The coronavirus, which first appeared in the central city of Wuhan, has already killed more than 200 people and infected more people than the SARS outbreak in 2003. A disease of this magnitude wasn't even on China's radar. Before the outbreak, the government was more worried that social unrest could be its ""black swan"" problem -- an improbable but chaotic event officials feared could be spurred by rising unemployment. Now Beijing is scrambling to stop the virus from cratering its economy. The ruling Communist Party recently put Premier Li Keqiang in charge of virus control. The decision was a clear signal that stopping the virus is ""the priority among priorities"" for the government right now, the official People's Daily newspaper wrote in a recent commentary. So far, policymakers have taken some steps to help the businesses that are most affected by the rapid spread of the disease. Central and local governments have allocated $12.6 billion so far to spend on medical treatment and equipment. Major banks have cut interest rates for small businesses and individuals in the worst-hit areas. And the Bank of China said it would allow people in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province to delay their loan payments for several months if they lose their source of income because of the disruption. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has said that it will ensure there is enough liquidity in the financial markets when they reopen next Monday after a 10-day Lunar New Year holiday. When Hong Kong's markets reopened earlier this week, the Hang Seng index Aggressive action The government will likely have to be even more aggressive in the coming months to avert a more serious slowdown, according to Chinese economist Zhang Ming. Zhang, who works at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote this week that he expects economic growth to slump by a percentage point to 5% in the first quarter, assuming the epidemic lasts until the end of March. He described that as his most optimistic scenario, but didn't give a specific forecast should the outbreak last even longer. The government could cut taxes and boost spending on public healthcare and employment training, Zhang said. He also expects local governments to spend more on infrastructure. By boosting economic activity and creating jobs, he added, cities can offset any weakness in private investment in real estate and manufacturing. The central bank is also likely to deliver more interest rate cuts to stabilize the economy, Zhang said. Altogether, he said such measures could help growth rebound next quarter and push annual GDP growth to around 5.7%. While that's lower than last year's 6.1% growth, it would be in line with many analyst expectations. Others take a more pessimistic view. Analysts at Nomura believe growth could drop by two percentage points or more in the first quarter. The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, wrote Friday that the outbreak could shave two percentage points off GDP growth this quarter, citing industry insiders. Government's efforts to contain the virus by extending Lunar New Year holidays and forcing factories to shut down could ""take a piece out of the nation's manufacturing industry and disrupt the global supply chain."" Measuring the fallout It's too early to say whether that level of upheaval is on the horizon. Tesla Other sectors might have more to lose right now. Tourism -- a multibillion-dollar industry during the Lunar New Year -- has been decimated as the government quarantines major population centers and people avoid traveling for fear of becoming infected. Major travel companies, hotels and airlines have offered refunds through most of February, while some airlines have suspended services to and from China. Holiday celebrations have been canceled and major tourism spots have been closed off. China's massive box office Zhang and other analysts suggested that the fallout could even be more serious than after SARS, the respiratory disease that caused China's economic growth to briefly plunge before rebounding nearly two decades ago. The spread of the coronavirus threatens to cause job losses and push consumer prices higher, compounding economic woes that already exist. The employment market is already under stress this year. Industries that traditionally create a lot of jobs, like the technology sector, have been hurt by the economic slowdown. The coronavirus outbreak will make things worse, according to Zhang. China's 290 million migrant workers are among those most exposed to a slump. Many of them travel from rural areas to the cities to take on construction and manufacturing jobs or perform low paying but vital work, such as waiting tables in restaurants, delivering packages or acting as janitors. But because many factories and businesses remain shut down, millions of those workers might find it hard to land a job after the extended Lunar New Year holiday ends. More than 10 million migrant workers from Hubei province alone might also face discrimination from employers fearful that they may spread the virus. Zhang warned that China's unemployment rate -- already a concern for officials -- could reach a record high in the coming months. The rate traditionally has hovered around 4% or 5%. He added the virus could also make consumer goods more expensive. Budgets are already tight because of rising debt, and a pork crisis brought on by the Other challenges Dealing with the disease will make some of China's other problems that much tougher to solve -- including its tricky trade relationship with the United States. As part of a truce reached earlier in January, Beijing agreed to buy Substantial tariffs totaling Even so, at least one analyst finds it unlikely that the trade war will escalate just because China is ""temporarily"" unable to honor its trade commitments. The United States is in an election year, and such an action could jeopardize President Donald Trump's campaign, said Ken Cheung, chief Asian foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank.",The coronavirus could cost China's economy $60 billion this quarter.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/02/health/kff-vaccine-survey-november/index.html,"CNN Most fully vaccinated adults in the United States say they plan to get a booster, according to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Demand for booster shots has increased dramatically over the past month - about 60% of fully vaccinated adults say they've already gotten their booster or ""definitely"" will. But nearly one in five fully vaccinated adults say that they ""probably"" or ""definitely"" won't get a booster, despite recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to do so. The latest KFF Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor survey was conducted for two weeks in mid-November. All fully vaccinated adults became eligible to receive a booster dose at the end of the survey period, but the CDC issued guidance encouraging all vaccinated adults to get boosters and information about the new Omicron variant became public after the survey ended. Findings are drawn from a nationally representative sample of 1,820 adults. At least half of adults across political parties and racial and ethnic groups already have or say they definitely will get a booster dose, but intent among older Republicans is notably lower than average. Overall, more than two-thirds (69%) of adults older than 50 have already received their booster shot or say that they definitely will, according to the latest survey. Among Democrats in this age group, about 87% already have or definitely plan to. But among older Republicans, only 58% said the same. Nearly 30% of older Republicans said they definitely or probably would not get a booster, compared to only about 6% of older Democrats. Young Black and Hispanic people are also less likely than average to say they'll get a booster shot. About two in five Black and Hispanic adults under the age of 50 said that they already have or definitely will get a booster dose, compared to nearly three in five young White adults who said the same. Once optimistic about the promise of Covid-19 vaccines, most Americans now say they feel frustrated over the country's current status, the latest KFF survey found. Staunch political divides seen in attitudes toward booster shots persist in attitudes toward Covid-19 vaccinations overall and extend to workplace mandates. About one in seven adults (14%) still say that they will ""definitely not"" get vaccinated, a share that has held steady all year. And only about 5% of adults plan to get vaccinated ""as soon as possible"" or ""only if needed,"" leaving very little room for the country's overall vaccination rate to change. More than a quarter of Republicans say that they will ""definitely not"" get vaccinated, along with more than one in five rural residents, White Evangelical Christians and adults under the age of 65 who are uninsured, according to the latest KFF survey data. Political division in attitudes toward Covid-19 vaccines extends beyond personal choice, too, findings from the survey suggest. Americans are split on their opinions of how well President Joe Biden has been handling the pandemic, with 44% of those surveyed saying they approve and 48% saying they do not. The administration's decision to mandate vaccination or weekly testing for employees of large companies is one of the latest divisive policies, with opinions again falling along party lines. The vast majority of Republicans (79%) oppose the federal policy, while most Democrats (86%) favor it. Opinions are similarly divided by vaccination status, with most vaccinated adults in favor and most unvaccinated adults against. The federal policy is on hold as it is debated in a federal appeals court, but more than a third of workers at companies with at least 100 employees said that they already have a vaccination requirement and another 17% want their employer to impose one. Vaccine requirements are much less common at smaller companies; only about 11% said a vaccine requirement was already in place and another 20% would want their employer to impose one. Since January, frustration has replaced optimism as the most common feeling toward the status of vaccines in the country, according to KFF survey data. Less than half (48%) of adults say they feel ""optimistic"" about vaccinations in the US, down from a third (66%) in January, while the share of those feeling frustrated rose from 50% to 58%. Feelings of anger over vaccines have also increased among Americans, up from about a quarter in January to nearly a third in November.

Heavy snow is expected near and north of the Interstate 95 corridor from Washington to Boston.

""If this happens, it would certainly increase the amount of snowfall for NYC above 12 inches."" If over a foot were to fall in New York City, it would be the most snowfall the city has seen from a single storm - or even in a month - since the historic blizzard in January of 2016. Early guidance suggests that if New York stays cold enough, the city will get anywhere from 8 to 14 inches of snow. Boston is on the northern fringe of the storm and could see a more drastic change in precipitation amounts, depending on where the storm tracks. Residents could see anywhere from a few inches to over a foot of snow. Washington is on the southern end and amounts could also vary depending on how much warmer air filters into the city, with the forecast for anywhere from a dusting to half a foot of snow. ""The gradient with this storm could be quite stark, with snow totals approaching a foot versus only a few inches separated by a county,"" the National Weather Service said. If warm air mixes in, the Washington area could see sleet and freezing rain mixing in. This same warm air will bring a wintery mix of snow and ice south through central and southwest Virginia and northwestern North Carolina. Winter storm watches are already posted for more than 25 million people in 10 states from southwestern Virginia to Massachusetts. Blustery wind conditions will also be a concern, with some areas, especially along the coast, coming close to blizzard conditions.

""We believe that some health care providers are regularly holding back doses that are intended as first doses, and instead keeping them in reserve for second doses for patients.

Slavitt suggested that in some cases, patients' appointments for a first dose are being canceled and pressed the urgency in getting first doses out as quickly as possible. He said the administration's move last week to provide a three-week window into vaccine shipping plans was meant to allay concerns that second doses could get held up.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/20/health/covid-vaccines-protect-from-variants/index.html,"CNN New research out this week provides reassuring evidence that people vaccinated against coronavirus will be protected against emerging new variants of the virus. Two teams tested two of the new variants against blood taken from people who had received the full two-course dose of either the Moderna or the Pfizer vaccine. While the mutations in the new variants of the virus - one first seen in Britain, and another first identified in South Africa - did allow them to evade some of the immunity induced by vaccination, it was far from a complete escape, the two teams reported separately. A team led by Dr. Michel Nussenzweig of the Rockefeller University tested plasma taken from 20 people who got two doses of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine as part of clinical trials. They found the vaccines produced strong antibody responses, as well as cells that keep producing new antibodies for months or years. ""We measured their antibody responses to the wild-type virus. Then we took their plasmas and measured them against the variants,"" Nussenzweig told CNN. Wild-type virus is the catchall name for virus generally circulating that is not changed enough to be designated a variant. Different mutations in the viruses did allow some escape from some types of antibodies, but the bodies of the volunteers threw an army of different types of antibodies at the viruses, the team r ""When you start putting all these mixtures of antibodies together, what it means is that together they can take care of the variants,"" Nussenzweig said.  Even though they had a reduced effect, overall the response was so overwhelming that it should not matter, he said. ""What we really want to do with these vaccines is keep people out of the hospital. They are extremely likely to do that, irrespective,"" Nussenzweig added. Eventually, the vaccines should be updated - but the new mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna can be changed very quickly. ""Should the vaccines be tweaked?"" he asked. ""Probably - but that doesn't mean that they won't be effective."" Separately, Ugur Sahin, who helped invent the BioNTech vaccine being made and distributed by Pfizer, teed his vaccine against the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in the UK. The team found ""no biologically significant difference in neutralization activity,"" they wrote ""Further data are needed to monitor the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine's effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 caused by new virus variants,"" the companies said in a joint statement. ""So far, for COVID-19 vaccines it has not been established what reduction in neutralization might indicate the need for a vaccine strain change. Should a vaccine strain change be required to address virus variants in the future, the Companies believe that the flexibility of BioNTech's proprietary mRNA vaccine platform is well suited to enable such adjustment."" Both Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are designed to be quick and easy to adjust. The coronavirus mutates constantly, like many other viruses. Compared to influenza, the changes have been slow and have not seemed to affect the severity of illness caused by infection. But at least two of the variants - one first seen in Britain and known as B.1.1.7 and another first noticed in South Africa and known as B.1.351 - do seem to make the virus more contagious. Scientists have been racing to see whether the changes in the virus will make it as susceptible to available treatments and vaccine. Earlier this week, Penny Moore, associate professor at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, published another pre-print study showing that people who have recovered from a wild-type coronavirus infection might be a little more susceptible to B.1.135. They tested antibody-rich blood serum from 44 people who had survived coronavirus infections before September. Half the people showed an antibody response that might not be expected to fight off the variant. Nussenzweig said that is not surprising. ""A small difference in the plasma neutralizing activity is something we should pay attention to but it is not a cause for alarm,"" he said. ""There is a very huge diversity in the magnitude of the responses that people get,"" he added. ""You don't have to be immunodeficient and you still might not create a great response to this virus. People's immune systems are as diverse as any human feature - for example, beauty, intelligence, hair color, how tall you are. The immune system is no different."" Nussenzweig said his team's experiments indicate that it might be weaker immune responses that are helping give rise to the coronavirus variants. The longer someone is infected, the greater the chance that the virus infecting them can mutate. ""The antibodies can select for these variants,"" he said. If a microbe is not stopped completely by the immune response, the variations that resist the immune response best will be those that survive. ""If people make a suboptimal response, they might start selecting for these variants,"" Nussenzweig said. That's why scientists are saying it's important to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, so that the virus stops circulating and thus stops mutating. Nussenzweig said his experiments indicate so far that the immune response prompted by vaccination is many times broader and stronger than what would be needed to control the virus.",Studies suggest vaccinated people protected from new Covid-19 variants

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/18/opinions/tide-turning-trump-rupert-murdoch-chris-christie-ghitis/index.html,"CNN What's that we hear? Is it the sound of prominent conservatives and Trump allies openly rebuking former President Donald Trump? Are these the early murmurs of a conservative backlash against Trump? And is it possible a political lane is opening for another Republican presidential candidate in 2024? It's too soon to know, of course, and there's plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies. The statements from Rupert Murdoch - who controls a media empire that includes, among other properties, the shamelessly pro-Trump Fox News - and from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie - an adviser who worked with the former president and helped him It was startling when Murdoch, Murdoch is not alone in arguing that Trump is a threat to conservatives. Christie, who has just published a new book that looks very much like his unofficial entry into the 2024 presidential race, is making the same case, only more forcefully. Consider the title of Christie's book - which effectively labels Trump a threat to the GOP: ""Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden."" Notice that Trump fits two of the three reasons the party needs saving (by Christie, presumably). Murdoch and Christie are not the first Republicans who have stood up to the former president -  but their rebukes of Trump are markedly different. Trump's early critics, like Senators Christie says many in the GOP are frightened of Trump, whose Sure, it's possible Murdoch and Christie's words may also fail to change the course of the GOP, but their criticism is different. They both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it's significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party - and the rest of the country - that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly. Coincidentally or not, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, finally Murdoch and Christie undoubtedly have their own personal motives for speaking out against Trump in this moment, and there's plenty of evidence to warrant accusations of hypocrisy. Murdoch, whose Fox News - home of Tucker Carlson, a purveyor of harmful lies and propaganda about everything from the Murdoch might be driven by a fear of liability and the potential damage additional lawsuits could inflict on his bottom line if Fox News continues to follow Trump down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and baseless claims. There is, also the possibility that he cares about the future of conservative politics, and genuinely fears the GOP might get trampled if Trump doesn't let up. Christie, for his part, is trying to promote his book and his prospects of occupying the White House. Still, it is remarkable that they have done the calculus and decided they can benefit from speaking out against the former president, even after other Republicans have been badly hurt by doing the same thing. I think their calculation makes sense. With President Joe Biden's ratings sinking, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are doomed. But it is Republicans who may be doomed if they continue to stick with the former president. There's no doubt the Biden administration is terrible at messaging. The economy is Even if Democrats are still in the doldrums in 2024, it's hard to imagine that voters will be yearning for another four years of Trumpian chaos. Biden may look uninspiring now, but the former president, who had the most consistently Do Republicans want a candidate embroiled in endless - and serious - legal troubles? According to the New York Times, prosecutors are likely to A There's the potential for a post-Trump Republican Party to gain ground. It still seems like a long shot at this point, but if his critics are successful in persuading the GOP to move in a different direction, there's a chance American democracy can return some semblance of normality, where political leaders debate what policies are best for the country, without fear of upsetting the tender, explosive feelings of a very bad loser.",Why the tide may be turning on Trump
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/13/health/covid-vaccine-rollout-messy/index.html,"CNN A vaccine kit sent to the wrong state. A hospital system in California expecting to get powdered vaccines instead of frozen vials. And tens of thousands of people expect to get vaccinated in the coming weeks, when in reality they are going to have to wait for months. The rollout of the first coronavirus vaccine is already messy, and it has only been authorized since late Friday night. The US Food and Drug Administration The federal government's Operation Warp Speed has been gearing up and holding news conferences headlined by generals promising a military-style rollout. But jokes about military precision aside, experts are already expecting a lot of confusion, a fair amount of fear and more than a little outrage. ""The public has to be cognizant that there is going to be unfairness or error or sometimes just stupidity,"" said Juliette Kayyem, a security specialist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and former assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. Here are some of the problems the US public can expect to see with any mass vaccination effort. People will have to wait It's clear there will not be enough vaccines for everyone who wants one right away. Pfizer is only expected to be able to supply 2.9 million doses in the first few days and only up to 6.4 million doses by December 19, according to Operation Warp Speed, the government's vaccine effort. Both Pfizer and Moderna together can only supply, at the most, 40 million doses by the end of the month. Vaccine advisers have already broken down priority groups into subgroups, and have only designated the very, very first people to get vaccines. Those in this 1a group designated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will include frontline health care workers and people in long-term care homes. But even that small group already outnumbers the vaccine supply. It's about 24 million people, and 40 million doses will only cover 20 million. Hospitals are planning to triage. ""I think we anticipate that we will not have enough for everybody at once. It's not going to be a one and done event,"" Dr. Marci Drees, chief infection prevention officer and hospital epidemiologist for Delaware-based ChristianaCare, told CNN. ""We don't know exactly how many vaccines we'll get."" Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui has projected Pfizer and Moderna together can make and deliver 60 million to 70 million vaccines in January, and hopes two other vaccines makers, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, will join the mix of authorized vaccines in the coming months. ""We can immunize 20 million in December, 30 million in January, 50 million in February,"" Slaoui said at the White House Tuesday. But he doesn't project having vaccinated the full population until June. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong with manufacturing. Moderna and Pfizer each say they can make up to a billion doses by the end of 2021, but Moderna says it might be half that - it's never made a product for sale before - and Pfizer has already severely adjusted its timeline for vaccine delivery after unspecified manufacturing problems. Distribution may seem unfair ACIP is the main group advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which in turn offers guidance to states. State and local authorities make their own decisions on who gets vaccinated, and when. The decision to vaccinate health care workers, nursing home residents and patients in rehabilitation facilities first was an easy one -people want doctors, nurses, technicians and others to be able to safely care for everyone, and long-term care facility residents have made up 40% of deaths so far. But it's going to get sticky after that. A big chunk of Americans fall into one high-risk group or another - especially since obesity raises the risk of severe disease, and more than 40% of Americans are obese. People over 65, people with diabetes, people with kidney disease, ethnic minorities, people with other chronic conditions - it will be hard to choose just a few of these groups to go next. And what about essential workers? The groups advising ACIP, including Johns Hopkins University and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, say it would be prudent to vaccinate people who work in food production, emergency workers and utility workers ahead of the general population. ACIP member Dr. Robert Atmar, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, said  ACIP will likely put essential workers into group 1b. ""That would include teachers, people in law enforcement, firefighters and a variety of other groups, and then 1c would be persons with underlying conditions who had higher risk of developing complications or dying should they get Covid-19 and that would include persons over the age of 65,"" he said. But even that could seem unfair, Kayyem said. ""There are a lot of people who are 64 years and 300 days who will say, 'in just a couple of weeks I could be in the next pool,'"" Kayyem said. ""It is going to seem somewhat unfeeling."" Organizations representing patients with various chronic conditions have started lobbying to ensure their particular patient populations of interest are included in the early target groups. ""There is no doubt that our country must give first access to populations most at risk for the worst of Covid-19's complications - including 34 million Americans living with diabetes,"" American Diabetes Association CEO Tracey Brown argued ""In discussion of who should qualify for Phase 1b access to a vaccine, ACIP thus far has discussed individuals with high-risk medical conditions, namely cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, obesity, a serious heart condition, sickle cell disease, and type 2 diabetes,"" the Muscular Dystrophy Association wrote in a letter to ACIP. ""MDA strongly believes that individuals living with a neuromuscular disease should be included in Phase 1b of vaccination administration due to the complexity of the multisystem impact of neuromuscular diseases that results in co-morbidities that cause a high risk for adverse Covid outcomes."" Kayyem also envisions a rural versus urban divide. ""It is very likely you are going to want the Pfizer vaccine to go to urban areas because it has to be frozen. That easier to do in urban areas than in rural areas,"" she said. For instance, the head of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii told CNN last month that not a single hospital in Hawaii had a freezer that can stay cold enough to store Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine and the state may not have enough access to dry ice to make proper use of the company's distribution boxes. And because the vaccines must be stored carefully and require two doses, some local decisions may be made to make efficient use of the vaccines. Some counties, for instance, may decide to vaccinate all staff and residents of nursing homes - even those who do not fall into designated priority groups. Others may offer vaccines to relatives so they can visit and help care for their loved ones. Some hospitals may opt to vaccinate patients along with staff to make good use of their vaccine allocations. There will be side effects Susan Froehlich of Dallas was pretty sure she got the real vaccine and not a placebo when she volunteered to take part in a clinical trial testing Moderna's vaccine. ""About 12 hours after I got the booster, it was 2:30 in the morning and I woke up with a terrible stomach ache and a headache and it was like I was at the beginning stages of a bad flu,"" Froehlich told CNN's coronavirus town hall last week ""It was like every part of my body was hurting for about four hours,"" Froehlich added. She felt better after taking naproxen. It's not unexpected. Slaoui has said up to 15% of Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trial participants have ""quite noticeable side effects"" including nausea, body aches, headaches and chills. ""I think those side effects are somewhat common,"" Slaoui told CNN earlier this month. They resolve quickly, but CDC and other officials are worried they might scare some people away from getting a second dose of the vaccine and are preparing educational materials to let people know the symptoms are a sign the vaccine is working to rev up the body's immune response and are harmless. Hospitals and the military are also planning around the possibility of having staff out sick after getting the shots. ""You don't want to vaccinate everybody on the same day,"" Drees said. Instead, several hospitals have said they'll stagger vaccinations just in case significant numbers of staff miss a few hours or even a day of work after getting the shot. There will be vaccine scares Pfizer's vaccine has already had its first scare in the US, with a  ""About one out of every million people that get a vaccine can have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine,"" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. In September, AstraZeneca paused its coronavirus vaccine trials because of a severe adverse event in a volunteer. The company later said one volunteer had ""an undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis"" and a second volunteer had ""an unexplained illness."" An internal company document pointed to a rare neurological condition called transverse myelitis. The trials restarted in Britain and elsewhere a few weeks later, but it wasn't until October 23 that the FDA allowed the trial to resume in the US after determining that the case was unrelated to the vaccine. AstraZeneca went through another scare when a volunteer in a trial in Brazil died, but it turned out the volunteer had been given a placebo and had died of Covid-19. ""One of the groups that is queued up to get vaccines early are the residents of long term care facilities,"" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who heads the CDC's respiratory diseases and immunizations branch. ""They are getting vaccine early because they're among the most fragile - 40% of deaths have been in those populations. They are medically fragile,"" Messonnier said in an interview with the Aspen Institute Monday. ""If we vaccinate in a nursing home on Monday, somebody dies on Wednesday, it will be a terrible tragedy. It may, but it's likely not related to the vaccine. So I hope that people will try to not jump to conclusions."" Such scares are certain to become more common as more and more people get vaccinated. The CDC plans to actively ask people about symptoms using a text-messaging app called V-Safe. At the same time, social media may be filled with stories of people who suffer illnesses or accidents and who link them to the vaccine - whether they are directly related or not. Drees said her hospital system will be ready to hear of these from workers who get vaccinated and is preparing an education campaign to help deal with it. ""We are very comfortable with the science behind this vaccine,"" she said. There will be mistakes Colorado saw a snafu with its very first rehearsal. A test shipment of a vaccine ancillary kit containing syringes, alcohol and other supplies got shipped to another state by mistake. ""This error in shipment was due to a label printing error with the manufacturer. The manufacturer has corrected the problem, but Colorado will not be receiving a second test shipment of the 'mock' ancillary kit,"" the state said in a statement earlier this month. One hospital system in California prepared its staff to receive vaccine in powdered form from Pfizer. Pfizer's vaccine is, in fact, shipped as a frozen fluid that must be diluted. ""One of the challenges that has not gotten a lot of attention is that we have not factored in space in our timeline to do a lot of hands-on training with the people who will be administering these vaccines,"" said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, which is supporting frontline workers who will administer Covid-19 vaccinations. Such mistakes can make for a rough rollout, said Mike Osterholm, head of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and an adviser to President-elect Joe Biden's transition team. ""Having a vaccine means nothing if it doesn't result in a vaccination. For that to happen, the vaccine has to travel the last mile to arrive on time, at the right temperature and where it will end up in the arm of the intended vaccinee,"" Osterholm said. There are many opportunities for mistakes to be made, Kayyem said. ""Any supply chain in which demand exceeds supply is going to be complicated because you are making allocation decisions all the time. You are making them across a country that is geographically dispersed, that is divided, and that is in the middle of a pandemic,"" Kayyem said. Vaccines that must be kept frozen at ultra-cold temperatures may thaw out and have to be thrown away. Vaccines may get sent to the wrong destination. A nurse may vigorously shake a precious vial of Pfizer vaccine - the package insert says that can ruin it, and instead says the vial should be inverted gently a few times to mix the contents. People will forget to come back for their second doses. ""There will be course corrections and someone, sometimes, is just going to do something stupid,"" Kayyem said.",The coronavirus vaccine rollout will be messy. People will have to deal with that.
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/30/health/omicron-delta-variant-comparison/index.html,"CNN The new Omicron variant of coronavirus, with its many mutations and seemingly quick spread in South Africa, is worrying scientists and government officials. But doctors want to remind Americans that they're already facing a pretty formidable coronavirus variant, and that's Delta. Delta managed to take over the entire United States in a matter of weeks in early summer, changing the outlook for a country that was rolling out vaccines and hope with equal speed. ""In late June, the seven-day moving average of reported cases was around 12,000. On July 27, the seven-day moving average of cases reached over 60,000. This case rate looked more like the rate of cases we had seen before the vaccine was widely available,"" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Delta currently accounts for more than 99% of cases of coronavirus that are genetically sequenced in the US, according to CDC. It remains to be seen whether Omicron will outcompete Delta, but it will be tough. ""We still have, of course, in the US, a serious surge of the Delta variant. We should be thinking about that,"" National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told CNN on Monday. The US is now averaging 70,094 new Covid-19 cases and 730 deaths each day, according to Johns Hopkins University. And JHU says 75% of intensive care unit beds in the US are occupied, 15% of them by Covid-19 patients. Comparing Omicron and Delta Much is being made of the 50 mutations that mark the Omicron variant - 32 of them on the spike protein, which is the club-shaped structure that covers the surface of the virus and is used to attach to human cells so the virus may infect them. But Delta has its own constellation of scary mutations, and they've made it the worst version of the virus yet seen. It races through populations, replacing more worrying variants that have mutations that should allow them to evade the effects of vaccines, like the Beta variant, for instance. Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University, has done a head-to-head comparison of the mutations seen in Delta and Omicron. Omicron does have ""a chunk of them at once,"" Garry told CNN. ""But we've kind of seen that kind of leap in evolution before,"" he added. ""There are definitely hotspots where this virus likes to mutate now,"" he said. But just because there are many mutations doesn't necessarily mean they'll add up to a meaner virus. ""What all those changes in the aggregate are going to do for the things that matter for this virus, we don't really know yet,"" Garry said. But he does not see many important mutations that might make the Omicron version more contagious than Delta. ""The ones that might affect transmissibility, I mean, I'm just not seeing a whole lot that would give it a real strong advantage over Delta,"" he said. ""That's really the big question. You know, when it gets into a population that has Delta, is it going to out-compete or not out-compete?"" Other genetics experts also note Omicron does not carry some of the changes that helped make Delta so very contagious. ""Given that Omicron lacks so many of the non-spike mutations that have seemed to contribute to Delta's increased fitness I wouldn't be surprised if its intrinsic transmissibility is similar to Gamma,"" Trevor Bedford, a genome scientist and epidemiologist at the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said on Twitter. He referenced Some of the mutations that increase transmissibility are also seen in variants that died out, such as one called Kappa. Protecting against Covid-19 Garry does see mutations that might help Omicron to evade the body's immune response - especially from previous infections. ""It's likely immune evasive. So is Delta, and before that Alpha and Beta. Should we be working on a specific vaccine? Yes,"" he said. The immune response prompted by vaccination is broader than the response produced by a natural infection, so vaccinated people may still be protected from severe disease, doctors said. ""Your best protection against Delta is to get vaccinated, and if you've already been vaccinated and six months have passed since you got Pfizer or Moderna, get your booster, two months since J&J, get your booster,"" Collins told CNN. ""That was a reason already, but now add Omicron to the mix,"" he said. ""And we do believe that this new variant, which will probably come to our shores, will also be something vaccines and boosters can help you with."" The CDC strengthened its guidance on boosters Monday, saying all adults should get booster shots six months after finishing the first two doses of Moderna's or Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine and two months after getting Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine. And there's no known mutation that can make a virus evade precautions such as face masks, handwashing and physical distancing. Even if a mutation helps a virus become more viable as an airborne pathogen, better ventilation can help prevent transmission.",Omicron vs. Delta: More mutations don't necessarily make a meaner Covid-19 virus

""On September 27, during the last meeting, there were parents or concerned citizens that voiced misinformation to you.""  This is not a uniquely American phenomenon. With authorization for younger kids in the US to get the shot expected around Halloween, look for this debate to become even more heated.  Parental choice has emerged as a major element of the Virginia governor's race, where Republican Glenn Youngkin has seized on comments made during a debate by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. ""I'm not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decision,"" McAuliffe said at the debate, later adding, ""I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach."" CNN's Eva McKend and Dan Merica report that   Moms are far more likely than dads - 70% vs. 42% - to support mask requirements. Two-thirds of parents in the poll said their school district was doing ""about the right amount"" and only 11% said their district was doing too much to limit the spread of Covid-19.  It's expected that a lot of the maybes will, over time, get the shot for their kids. That's what's happened both with adults getting their own vaccines and for kids CBS asked parents about their support for masks in a different way than Kaiser, and saw the following results:  It's a more sizable minority who are open to other people wearing masks but opposed to mask requirements. The CBS News poll also uncovered festering animosity among the vaccinated toward holdouts.  In Texas, Abbott has tapped into Republicans' bristling at mandates with his new ban on vaccine mandates by any entity in the state.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/29/health/coronavirus-variants-what-we-know-november/index.html,"CNN  Its emergence has led to But it has a long way to go to take over from Delta, the variant that dominates all over the world. And the long list of variants that at first frightened the world before falling off the map can be a reminder that viruses are unpredictable. Here's a look at the named coronavirus variants. Variants of concern WHO designates coronavirus variants as either variants of concern - meaning they look dangerous enough to bear close scrutiny and continual updates - or as variants of interest, or variants under monitoring. Only five currently meet the definition for variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. Omicron The first sample of the Omicron or B.1.1.529 lineage was taken November 9, according to WHO. It got noticed because of a surge of cases in South Africa. ""This new variant, B.1.1.529 seems to spread very quick!"" Tulio de Oliveira, director of South Africa's Center for Epidemic Response & Innovation Also, genetic sequencing showed it carried a large number of troubling mutations on the spike protein - the knoblike structure on the surface of the virus that it uses to grapple onto the cells it infects. Some of those mutations were already recognized from other variants and were known to make them more dangerous, including one called E484A - a slighly altered version of a mutation called E484K that may make the virus less recognizable to some antibodies - immune system proteins that are a frontline defense against infection and that form the basis of monoclonal antibody treatments. It also carries a mutation called N501Y, which gave both Alpha and Gamma their increased transmissibility. Scott Weaver of the University of Texas Medical Branch and colleagues Like Delta, Omicron also carries a mutation called D614G, which appears to help the virus better attach to the cells it infects. ""Early evidence suggests that fully vaccinated people who become infected with the Omicron variant can spread the virus to others. All FDA-approved or authorized vaccines are expected to be effective against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths,"" the CDC says on its website. ""The number of mutations per se does not mean that the new variant will cause any problems; although it may make it more likely to look different to the immune system,"" Dr. Peter English, former chair of the British Medical Association's Public Health Medicine Committee, said in a statement. What worries scientists is the number of mutations affecting the spike protein. That's because most of the leading vaccines target the spike protein. Vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and other companies all use just small pieces or genetic sequences of the virus and not whole virus, and all of them use bits of the spike protein to elicit immunity. So a change in the spike protein that made it less recognizable to immune system proteins and cells stimulated by a vaccine would be a problem. Early experiments have shown the variant can at least partly evade the protection offered by vaccines as well as some of the monoclonal antibody treatments in use. Several people identified with infections caused by Omicron have not only been fully vaccinated but boosted, as well. Lab dish experiments using blood taken from vaccinated people also indicate that the Omicron variant can evade the immunity elicited by vaccines and booster shots. But doctors agree that vaccination is likely to provide at least some protection against Omicron and urge people to get vaccinated if they are not already. Omicron has been detected in many countries and its fast spread in the UK has prompted health officials there to say they expect it to overtake Delta as the dominant variant there. It takes an It's also too soon to tell whether Omicron causes more severe disease, although one doctor who treated some patients in South Africa told Reuters her patients had only mild symptoms. ""The most predominant clinical complaint is severe fatigue for one or two days, with then the headache and the body aches and pain,"" Dr. Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of the South African Medical Association, said. Cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus reported in European countries appear to be ""mostly mild,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said. ""Cases appear to be mostly mild, however we need to gather more evidence to determine whether the spectrum of disease severity caused by Omicron is different (to) that of all the viruses that have been circulating so far,"" EMA's Head of Biological Health Threats and Vaccines Strategy Marco Cavaleri said December 9. Physical barriers also will work against any mutant virus. These include masks, handwashing, physical distancing and good ventilation. ""Much uncertain but we know what works vs. CoV-19: - improving indoor ventilation - quality masks/respirators - avoid indoor crowds - distancing - test, isolate, quarantine - vax + booster now for Delta,"" Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle & King County, tweeted Sunday. While experts say they're watching closely, several have said they are not especially worried about Omicron just yet. ""I don't think we should panic,"" Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University School of Medicine, told CNN. ""The sky is not falling,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor, told CNN. ""We've not seen any evidence that Omicron causes any more severe disease than any other variants."" Delta The Delta variant of coronavirus is the dominant lineage in the US and much of the world. The Delta variant accounts for 99.9% of cases in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Also known as B.1.617.2, it is clearly more transmissible than other variants, but it is still unclear if it causes more severe disease. It quickly took over from the B.1.1.7, or Alpha, variant in most countries. Delta also carries a cluster of mutations on the spike protein. It can also evade the immune system, which may mean people who have been infected once with an older variant may be more likely to catch it again. It also eludes the effects of a monoclonal antibody treatment called bamlanivimab, made by Eli Lilly and Company, but is vulnerable to the protection offered by other monoclonal antibody treatments. Alpha First identified as a variant of concern last December, the B.1.1.7 or Alpha variant of coronavirus was worrying public health officials last spring. It swept across England quickly and then out into the world, quickly becoming the dominant lineage in the United States. It has now been demoted to ""Variant Being Monitored"" by the CDC because of its low impact in the US. It was shown to be at least 50% more transmissible than older lineages. It carries 23 mutations, including one called N501Y that increases transmission. It's fully susceptible to monoclonal antibody treatments and vaccines. Beta First seen in South Africa, the B.1.351 or Beta variant has both an E484K mutation that is linked with immune escape and the N501Y mutation suspected of helping make many other variants more contagious. It has been shown to be 50% more transmissible than older strains and evades Lilly's dual monoclonal antibody treatment, but not others. Blood tests and real-life use both suggest it can infect people who have recovered from coronavirus and also people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19. Vaccine makers trying to get out ahead of the new variants by developing booster shots had focused on B.1.351, as it's the variant scientists most fear could elude vaccine protection. But partial escape doesn't mean full escape, and vaccines are still expected to protect people to some degree. It was overtaken by Delta in South Africa and have never gained much of a foothold in the US, despite the worry it caused, and is now designated a Variant Being Monitored by the CDC. Gamma The P.1 or Gamma variant that swept Brazil also never gained much ground elsewhere and is also now a CDC Variant Being Monitored. Gamma carries both E484K and N501Y mutations, with more than 30 others. It has been demonstrated to evade the effects of Lilly's monoclonal antibody treatment but not one made by Regeneron. Blood tests show it might partly escape both natural and vaccine-elicited immune responses.

The agency said the funds, which were approved as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief law, ""will be able to be deployed quickly"" and will help schools test teachers, students and staff who were exposed to the virus and help identify asymptomatic cases of the virus to prevent the virus from spreading further in schools. ""Covid-19 testing is critical to saving lives and restoring economic activity,"" the agency's acting Secretary Norris Cochran said in a statement. ""As part of the Biden administration's national strategy, HHS will continue to expand our capacity to get testing to the individuals and the places that need it most, so we can prevent transmission of the virus and defeat the pandemic."" White House Covid-19 testing coordinator Carole Johnson said during a Wednesday briefing that HHS's $10 billion in funding for testing will ""add a layer of protection for schools, teachers and students."" ""We know that school districts want to reopen. But up to this point, many lacked the resources to set up Covid screening programs for students, teachers and staff to help keep Covid out of our schools. Today that all changes,"" Johnson said. ""This funding can be used to test teachers and staff, students and others with symptoms of Covid, those who may have been exposed and to establish sustained, regular screening testing programs across the school system,"" Johnson added, saying that the CDC will be working alongside state and local health departments to provide technical assistance as they work to implement the testing programs.  The CDC will also spend an additional $2.25 billion to boost testing and other mitigation measures in underserved populations, which will include grants to public health departments and funding to improve data collection efforts. The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan delivered a windfall for coronavirus testing efforts in the US, dedicating a total of $47.8 billion. Biden's efforts to reopen schools have moved ahead in fits and starts over the last month, amid messaging stumbles, pressure from Republicans to move faster and feuds between some teachers' unions and school districts across the country. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and New York State United Teachers President Andy Pallotta praised the $10 billion investment in Covid testing infrastructure. Pallotta said in a statement that, with the allocation, ""the Biden administration is sending them a clear signal about what it takes to reopen safely."" Weingarten said that, with the funding, ""help truly is on the way to aid school systems in implementing a testing system that will help keep students, educators and staff safe inside school buildings.""",HHS announces $10 billion to expand coronavirus testing in schools
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/03/health/coronavirus-genome-sequencing-omicron/index.html,"CNN Rows of scientists sit before racks of coronavirus samples inside a laboratory in Henderson, North Carolina, wearing face masks and scrubs. All hours of the day and night, they transfer the samples from tubes to processing plates, searching for answers about the virus behind these Covid-19 cases. From confirming a positive Covid-19 sample to prepping the DNA and then sequencing it, the process takes two to three days in the lab, said Lauren Moon, sequencing manager for MAKO Medical's Next Generation Sequencing Lab in North Carolina. Work like this is happening in labs around the United States as the country races to learn more about the newly identified Omicron variant. ""Knowledge is power in this, and the more that we know about something the more equipped we are to fight it. The more effective our vaccines are going to be and the more informed the public is, they can take appropriate safety measures,"" Moon told CNN's Dianne Gallagher. ""We want to sequence as much as possible,"" Moon said. This lab has not yet detected Omicron variant positive tests, but cases are starting to emerge in several states. These discoveries are no surprise. They're the moments genetic detectives have been preparing for - and the reason the US has been ramping up its sequencing abilities. As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded, other countries were able to identify changes to the virus sooner and take action quicker. Early this year, Biden administration officials acknowledged the country was "" After South African scientists announced last week they had detected a previously unknown coronavirus variant, US officials acknowledged it was likely here already. They just had to sequence enough coronavirus samples to find it. For now, almost all US Covid-19 cases are driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant, but on Wednesday, the first US Omicron case was identified in California. Then came another in Minnesota, then Colorado, more in New York City and in ""We are now sequencing approximately 80,000 samples per week - about one in every seven PCR positive cases,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky There are a lot of unanswered questions around Omicron: Is it more transmissible? Can it cause more severe disease? Does it evade protection from vaccination or previous infection? The answers start in the lab. Sequencing many more specimens than a year ago  Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said in a written statement to CNN that sequencing can take just a couple days, but for many, it's longer. ""We generally say about a week,"" Wroblewski said. It's not as simple as a Covid-19 test with a swab. Only samples that are sent into laboratories for diagnostic testing can be sequenced to look for the genetic evidence to tell which variant of virus has infected someone. The types of tests - diagnostic and sequencing - are done separately. Polymerase chain reaction or PCR testing makes the process easier. Quick antigen tests are not used to detect variants, nor are tests people take on their own at home. Earlier this year, in January, an international database showed the United States ranked 61st in how quickly virus samples were collected from patients, analyzed and then posted online - taking about 85 days. Countries with far fewer resources, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Suriname, processed samples more quickly than the United States. As of November 24, based on An ""Back in January, the numbers were quite low. It was really I think under half a percent in terms of the Covid infections that were prevalent were getting sequenced,"" said Dr. Ingrid Katz, associate faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. ""The UK, for example, was sequencing around that time around 5%. That turning point came in April, many months before the emergence of Omicron, when the Biden administration announced plans to The identification of the first known Omicron cases in the United States and ""the rapid turnaround in sequence analysis is an example of the importance of our investments this year to expand genomic sequencing across the country - and to build a system that is prepared to swiftly respond to new and emerging Covid variants,"" Walensky said during a White House briefing Friday. Currently, there are about 68 state and local public health laboratories sequencing for coronavirus variants as a ""critical part"" of the CDC's These labs ""are sequencing between 15,000 and 20,000 specimens per week. That number is four times greater than just a year ago,"" Becker said. ""In November of 2021 alone, 190,000 specimens were sequenced by the entire public health system, which includes public health labs, CDC, and CDC-contracted labs. In addition, public health laboratories also submit a subset of those specimens to CDC for strain characterization, and more detailed lab studies,"" Becker said in the briefing. ""Nationally between 5% and 10% of all diagnostic specimens are sequenced and come from public health laboratories, commercial laboratories, CDC-contract labs, academic labs, and other partners,"" Becker said Tuesday. ""Our system can detect variants down to 0.1% of circulating viruses."" Still, that can vary from place to place. Lea Starita of the There's also room for improvement, wrote Starita, research assistant professor in the department of genome sciences at the University of Washington and co-director of the Brotman Baty Advanced Technology Lab. ""I would like to see a concerted effort to require COVID-19 testing for incoming travelers where positive cases could be followed up with sequencing,"" Starita wrote, adding that ""being able to more easily link the sequencing data available in the US to health data would aid genomic epidemiology efforts."" 'It's just got to be part of our public health response moving forward' In places like the United Kingdom, there is a more centralized system for data, Starita wrote. ""The UK prioritized sequencing from the beginning of the pandemic and had a huge head start. Furthermore, because of their nationalized health care system, the UK can tie their sequence data back to patient data very quickly to link variants to disease severity, drug treatments, vaccine status,"" Starita wrote. ""This is obviously a massive boon to epidemiology efforts and is extremely difficult in the US with its broken health care system and balkanized health data."" In South Africa, where health authorities first alerted the world to the Omicron variant, the nation ""has had a robust genomic epidemiology program"" that began years before the coronavirus pandemic in order to track human immunodeficiency virus or HIV and tuberculosis, Starita wrote. ""The key to spotting new COVID-19 variants is having sufficient national coordination and a dedicated workforce,"" Peter Thielen, a molecular biologist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, wrote in a separate email to CNN. ""The US has and continues to improve genomic surveillance capacity through partnerships that span academic, commercial, and government laboratories,"" Thielen wrote. ""In places such as the UK and South Africa, their surveillance capacity has allowed them to very quickly identify variants from within their borders, and this has enabled exceptionally rapid data dissemination. Once a variant is identified in one location, countries like the US can quickly mobilize to identify variant introduction within communities or as they enter into the country."" Having such a centralized system to help connect variants with the impact they had on a Covid-19 patients' outcome can also help scientists examine which mutations could be associated with more severe illness or transmissibility. ""When the virus is accumulating mutations, typically, it's mutations that make the virus more fit that occur - mutations that allow the virus to persist. So, when we see a lot of mutations, we have to think that those mutations are making the virus more fit,"" Stacia Wyman, a senior genomics scientist at the Innovative Genomics Institute of the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN. Sequencing programs will remain important to track emerging pathogens around the world for years to come, said Katz of Harvard Medical School. ""It's just got to be part of our public health response moving forward. It's a good, important investment,"" Katz told CNN. ""I wish I could say that this is going to be the only global pandemic we'll see in our lifetime, but unfortunately, I think that's pretty unlikely.""",The Omicron variant is putting America's coronavirus sequencing efforts to the test
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/18/health/hosting-online-party-tips-zoom-wellness/index.html,"CNN With rising case numbers all over the world, the Covid-19 pandemic has guaranteed that Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa and Christmas will look different this year. For most of us -- at least those of us who plan to follow Zoom has suspended the usual 40-minute limit for all meetings globally from midnight Eastern time November 26 to 6 a.m. Eastern time November 27. What should you consider as you plan a holiday over this medium? And how can you make this newfangled spin on family traditions memorable? Here are five ways to shine. Make it a production By this point in the pandemic -- eight months and counting -- adults,  children and maybe even the family pet have logged hundreds of hours on Zoom. As such, it's important to think of a virtual holiday as an opportunity to do something out of the ordinary. Yes, this might mean an impromptu poetry reading. It also could mean a ""Blair Witch Project""-style video investigation of the smell coming from behind the garage fridge. Paula Rizzo, a media trainer and author in New York City, suggested holiday hosts look at the virtual event as an opportunity for creativity. Envision it as if you were producing a television show and ask yourself: What do you want people to remember about it? Rizzo turned 40 during the Covid-19 pandemic and had to cancel her big plans to travel to Europe. Still wanting to do something fabuulous, she hired a sommelier to guide her and her friends and family through a wine and food tasting. Rizzo sent out menu ideas and what wines to purchase ahead of the party. She even hired a camera person who shot photos and created a video reel of the event for posterity. ""We visited Italy, Spain and France,"" said Rizzo, a former television producer with an eye to visuals. ""(Your holiday) can be as simple or as complicated as you'd like, but do more than just stare at each other on a video call."" Rizzo added that while she advises against using custom Zoom backgrounds for work, incorporating them for a virtual holiday event could make the celebration more enjoyable. She said a host could challenge participating family members to create their own backgrounds and set up some sort of contest that rewards homemade prizes for originality, attention to detail and overall vibe, to name a few. ""The possibilities are endless and can add to the fun,"" she said. Come together around food and wine As Rizzo experienced during her birthday celebration, food and drink offer an obvious opportunity for friends and family members to come together during virtual holidays. This can be as easy as firing up the Zoom app to run through dinner, though it may behoove you to invest in a movie screen and a projector so people don't have to squint to see Grandma and Grandpa in a box on a standard laptop screen or monitor. Still, not everybody loves eating on camera, said Rebecca Gardner, an ""No one wants to be caught in front of a screen for a long time,"" she said. Instead, Gardner suggested sharing one aspect of the meal together, such as a toast that ""shows effort."" Highlighting a special moment, she said, ""feels festive and sets the Zoom apart from another day at the office."" In Salt Lake City, author Lindsay Eagar was planning to build her virtual holiday Zoom around dessert. Eagar, who loves to bake, said she expected to bake mini pies in flavors such as apple cardamom, chocolate peanut butter and pumpkin, then place them in brown boxes and distribute them to family members in the area so everyone can indulge at once. Eagar described it as a ""mystery pie date,"" noting that she and her two daughters, ages 10 and 4, will instruct family members to wait to open their boxes until everyone is on a Zoom call so they can experience the big reveal together. ""I'm a dessert fiend,"" Eagar wrote in a recent email. ""My mom lives 15 minutes away, so we'll bring the pies that morning and say hello from the porch with masks."" Incorporate entertainment All live events are better with entertainment, and your virtual holiday celebration is no exception. One way to rise to the challenge: tasking your teenager to play engaging (and PG-13) music videos or TikToks throughout the event. Another option: providing entertainment yourself. Canadians celebrate their version of Thanksgiving on the second Monday of October, which means they already have experienced virtual events for the annual holiday. For his family's virtual gathering, John Gunter and his family traveled from their home in Winnipeg to the family cabin in Grausdin Point, Manitoba. Comfortably situated in the vacation digs up north, the family fired up the Zoom apps and connected with relatives all over North America -- only to watch one cousin engage in a bit of performance art. ""One of the teenagers joined on his own connection (even though his mom was in the same house as him) and spent the whole time rebuilding a fishing reel, which we joked about,"" Gunter remembered in a recent email. Back in the United States, some families -- and a host of companies -- have inked a different kind of show: a professional, made-for-virtual-meetings magic act. The two-man gig, dubbed The experience is the brainchild of Brooklyn-based tech magicians Ryan Oakes and Doug McKenzie, two performers who in March pivoted their in-person magic show to exist online. While the magic differs every time, the goal is the same no matter what: to make the virtual space engaging in real life. ""Our initial approach was to create a show that you couldn't watch as a recording,"" Oakes said. ""We wanted something that could replicate the feeling of being in a room with people, understanding the realities of the current time which, of course, prevent any of us from being in a room with other people (outside those in our families)."" Oakes added: ""It's a great way to avoid having to talk about politics."" Play some games If magic isn't your family's jam, leveraging technology to play virtual games might be another way to celebrate as an extended group. Eagar, the author in Salt Lake City, said her family loves Marco Polo, an app that enables users to send short video snippets to each other, and noted that they were looking forward to playing movie quote trivia with that technology on Thanksgiving. Other families might send family members on scavenger hunts around their respective houses for specific (and Thanksgiving-themed) items. Another popular option for some families: a form of virtual charades called Heads Up! Jared Reichert, founder and creative director of ""(This is) no different than dinner party banter,"" he said. ""Virtual experiences allow you to expand the table without any fuss."" Of course, families can go deep on multiplayer video games. Particularly for extended families that comprise serious gamers, this activity could be a great way to extend virtual togetherness deep into the evening. (One caveat: Because these games are addicting, eat dinner first.) Allow for open time Finally, no matter how structured you opt to make your virtual holiday, it's always a good idea to build in some free time for guests to mingle and interact however they'd like. Shonda Waxman experienced this firsthand in October following the bat mitzvah of her daughter Hannah. Meeting organizers from Temple Beth Israel in Portland, Oregon, livestreamed the event on Zoom, and left the Zoom running after the service so guests could talk among themselves. According to Waxman, participants from both sides of the family seized this opportunity for individualized greetings, catch-ups and mazel tovs. At one point in the immediate aftermath of the main event, her father in Kentucky was able to congratulate the child's other grandparents, who had logged on from their home in New Jersey. ""It was very special since it was a unique opportunity to get our families together,"" Waxman said. ""Given the current situation, it was as magical and beautiful"" as it would have been in person.",5 tips for hosting a virtual holiday party

The Washington DC split screen was stark. While Political economist Greg Valliere called the trade deal ""a life preserver, right on schedule"" for a president facing an impeachment trial and also a win for investors weary of trade war. ""The uncertainty that plagued US small businesses and farmers will subside, as Trump will boast on the campaign trail for the next several months,"" Valliere noted. But this is not the trade deal that the president set out to forge two years ago. It's not even the broad agreement that fell apart in May. And while there are notable wins for the US on intellectual property protection and a promise on forced-technology transfers, the big pledge on agriculture essentially fixes the damage caused by the trade war itself. Further, this deal leaves the biggest problems for later. It doesn't address cybersecurity or China's massive scheme of industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises. (The US is now working with Japan and the European Union to address Chinese subsidies through the World Trade Organization.) Meanwhile, tariffs remain on $370 billion in Chinese-made goods - the vast majority of US imports. At the beginning of the trade war, importers and retailers absorbed as much of the tariff as they could. Many economists don't think that can last and will end up raising prices for American consumers. The remaining tariffs are meant to keep the Chinese at their word and work toward another deal. ""I will agree to take those tariffs off if we are able to do phase two,"" the president said. But there's plenty of skepticism about a meaningful phase two deal happening anytime soon. ""Now that the ink has dried on",The trade war is still on. Consider this a fragile truce
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/02/health/covid-19-vaccination-kit-record-card/index.html,"CNN The Department of Defense released the first images of a Covid-19 vaccination record card and vaccination kits Wednesday. Vaccination cards will be used as the ""simplest"" way to keep track of Covid-19 shots, said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, which is supporting frontline workers who will administer Covid-19 vaccinations. ""Everyone will be issued a written card that they can put in their wallet that will tell them what they had and when their next dose is due,"" Moore said. ""Let's do the simple, easy thing first. Everyone's going to get that."" Vaccination clinics will also be reporting to their state immunization registries what vaccine was given, so that, for example, an entity could run a query if it didn't know where a patient got a first dose. Moore said many places are planning to ask patients to voluntarily provide a cell phone number, so they can get a text message telling them when and where their next dose is scheduled to be administered. Every dose administered will be reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. The CDC did not immediately respond to CNN's inquiry about whether such a database would include a record of everyone immunized. As far as vaccine kits, the DoD image shows the kits include a card, a needle and syringe, alcohol wipes and a mask. Operation Warp Speed has 100 million vaccine kits ready to go if and when distribution of a coronavirus vaccine starts, Gen. Gustave Perna, Warp Speed's chief operating officer, said last month. The images come as two companies - Pfizer and Moderna - Should Pfizer and Moderna get the authorization, the vaccines' first shipments could happen December 15 and 22, respectively, Initial supplies in the United States By February, 100 million Americans could be vaccinated against coronavirus, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said Wednesday. The United States has said if both Pfizer and Moderna win FDA emergency use authorization in December, they could distribute 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of the month.

The hospitalized worker's reaction was more serious but not life-threatening, doctors said: She felt flushed within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine Tuesday at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau and later reported symptoms including shortness of breath and elevated heart rate. The second Bartlett health care worker was treated for less severe symptoms after being injected Wednesday, felt fine within an hour and was released, hospital officials said. The cases are the first allergic reactions The two workers were among staff being vaccinated at Bartlett Regional Hospital as part of the rollout of Pfizer's vaccine across the country this week. State health officials reported the first one Wednesday, and the hospital publicized the second later in the day. ""We expected that a side effect like this could occur after reports of anaphylaxis were made in England after people there received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine,"" Alaska's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink said after the first reaction was reported. ""All sites that are approved to provide vaccinations in Alaska must have medications on hand to deal with an allergic reaction and that was the case in Juneau."" The first staff member was admitted to the hospital The first worker was initially held in the vaccine monitoring area right after receiving the shot Tuesday and took a Benadryl, said Dr. Lindy Jones, an attending physician at Bartlett Memorial Hospital. When she reported shortness of breath, she was taken to the emergency room. When Jones saw her in the hospital, he said she was experiencing shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate, and had developed a rash covering her face and torso. ""I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction so gave her the standard treatment of a dose of intramuscular epinephrine and she responded immediately,"" Jones told a news briefing. She was also given antihistamines. She still had an elevated heart rate and was breathing fast - a sign of an allergic reaction - so Jones gave her another dose of epinephrine, as well as steroids ""which is another standard bread and butter treatment for adverse anaphylactic reactions,"" he said. The worker, who was not further identified to protect her privacy, had no previous history of allergies to vaccines, Jones said. She was almost recovered after a night in the intensive care unit, Jones said. Later Wednesday, she still was recovering well but would remain another night in the hospital, representatives there said. ""She was still enthusiastic that she got the vaccine and the benefits it would give her in the future,"" Jones said.

Whereas the first worker showed signs of a serious, The second worker ""was taken to the emergency department and administered epinephrine, Pepcid and Benadryl,"" the release reads. ""He felt completely back to normal within an hour and was released"" Like the first worker, the second ""does not want his experience to have a negative impact on his colleagues lining up for the vaccine,"" the statement reads. Both incidents were reported to the CDC ""Both incidents were reported to the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. Bartlett Regional Hospital and the State of Alaska Department of Health and Social Services are in close communications with the CDC, and the agency is providing guidance and support,"" the hospital's statement reads. Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said on Wednesday that doctors will have to keep an eye out for allergic reactions to the new vaccine. ""It's the kind of thing that we're obviously going to need to look at,"" Offit told CNN's Brianna Keilar. He noted there were two reported cases of allergic reaction in Britain, which rolled out the vaccine earlier this month. ""There were obviously several people in the United Kingdom who had had a severe allergic reaction to this vaccine and had a history of severe allergic reaction,"" said Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""Currently, the CDC recommendation is that if you ever had a severe allergic reaction to an injectable medical product, you shouldn't get this vaccine,"" Offit added. ""About one out of every million people that get a vaccine can have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. What we need to find out is what specifically seems to be inducing this allergic reaction."" The FDA is working with Pfizer and the CDC to better understand what happened in Alaska, an FDA spokeswoman said Wednesday after the first allergic reaction in Alaska was publicized. ""Importantly, the fact sheets to health care providers include language that severe allergic reactions have been reported following vaccination and that appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available for administration of any individual in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs,"" the spokeswoman told CNN. The ""Recent media reports of reactions to the new Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, first out of the UK and now one report in the United States are stirring safety concerns for people with a history of serious allergies. It's important to remember that we still don't have the full details regarding the specifics of any of these reported reactions,"" Dr. Mitchell Grayson, chair of the foundation's medical scientific council said in a written statement Wednesday, before the second Alaskan case was publicized. ""We're in the early stages of COVID-19 vaccine rollout. It is common to see adverse vaccine reactions once wider distribution to the general public begins, even if none of these reactions were observed in clinical trials,"" Grayson said. ""Additional vaccines are in the pipeline so there will likely be more options if it is determined that one vaccine works better in certain populations than others. It's important to let the science do its work, not the headlines.

But making a policy is the easy part - enforcing it consistently is where platforms often fall short. Facebook, Twitter and other platforms have their work cut out for them: The coronavirus and pending vaccines have already been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, which platforms have taken action on or created policies about. Some have made false claims about the effectiveness of masks or baseless assertions that microchips will be implanted in people who get the vaccine. Earlier this month, Facebook booted a large private group dedicated to anti-vaccine content. But many groups dedicated to railing against vaccines remain.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/12/health/b117-variant-covid-19-lancet-studies/index.html,"CNN Two new studies suggest that the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant, which was first identified in the United Kingdom, is more transmissible, but the variant does not appear to impact disease severity. The findings clash with separate research that previously suggested the variant may be tied to a higher risk of dying from Covid-19. One of the studies, published on Monday in The other study, also published Monday in 'Patients with B.1.1.7 were younger and had fewer comorbidities' The Lancet Infectious Diseases study included data on 496 people who were admitted to hospitals in London and tested positive for coronavirus infection. ""Our data, within the context and limitations of a real-world study, provide initial reassurance that severity in hospitalised patients with B.1.1.7 is not markedly different from severity in those without, and this study provides a model to answer the same question again as we move into an era of emerging variants,"" the researchers, based in the United Kingdom, wrote in the study. Nose and throat swab samples were collected from the patients between November 9 and December 20. Among those samples, 341 underwent genome sequencing. The sequence data showed that 198 of the patients, or 58%, had infections caused by the B.1.1.7 variant while the others were caused by other strains of the coronavirus. The researchers found no difference in the outcome of severe disease or death between the variant and other lineages. For instance, the data showed that 36% of patients in the study with the B.1.1.7 variant infection experienced severe illness or death compared with 38% of those with non-B.1.1.7 infections. When it came to death specifically, 16% of with the B.1.1.7 variant infection died within 28 days compared with 17% of those with non-B.1.1.7 infections, the researchers found. But the researchers identified increased viral load among the B.1.1.7 patients. Overall, ""patients with B.1.1.7 were younger and had fewer comorbidities than those with non-B.1.1.7 infection, possibly representing the widespread and potential increased transmission of this variant in the community or differences in probability of hospital admission, which we were not able to explore in this hospital-based cohort,"" the researchers wrote. ""Finding B.1.1.7 more commonly in younger versus older individuals gives a subtle hint of more severe disease if patients with B.1.1.7 are hospitalised more often compared with patients with other lineages, although difference in disease severity by B.1.1.7 was not found in this hospitalised cohort in the main analysis."" 'This study adds to the consensus that B.1.1.7 has increased transmissibility' The Lancet Public Health study included data on 36,920 people who reported testing positive for Covid-19 and logged their symptoms into the COVID Symptom Study app between September 28 and December 27. The app - designed by doctors and scientists at King's College London, Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals and Zoe Global Limited, a health technology company - helps track the spread of Covid-19 and the range of symptoms experienced. The study's authors, based in the United Kingdom and the United States, analyzed the data reported in the app along with Covid-19 surveillance data for the UK. The analysis showed that the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant in certain regions and over time was not associated with changes in Covid-19 symptoms reported in the app or the duration of symptoms. ""The proportion of users with asymptomatic disease did not significantly change as the B.1.1.7 variant increased in prevalence, in agreement with other studies on the subject,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""We also found no changes in admissions to hospital; however, other reports have shown that the B.1.1.7 variant increases rates of admission to hospital."" The researchers found that the rate of coronavirus reinfections was low - with 0.7% of app users who reported a positive Covid-19 test testing positive again after 90 days - and there was no evidence of increased reinfection rates associated with the B.1.1.7 variant. The researchers did not have data on risk of dying from Covid-19 and most of the app users get tested only when they have symptoms, so there were relatively few asymptomatic infections in the data. Yet the researchers found a ""multiplicative increase"" in the reproduction number of the B.1.1.7 variant, suggesting it can spread more easily. ""This study adds to the consensus that B.1.1.7 has increased transmissibility, which has contributed in large part to the sharp rise in cases in the UK over the study period and beyond, as well as ongoing third waves in European countries with growing burdens of B.1.1.7 cases,"" Britta Jewell, of Imperial College London, wrote in an editorial that accompanied the new study in the journal The Lancet Public Health. Jewell was not involved in the new study. ""Although B.1.1.7 might have similar symptomatology to that of other lineages, the emergence of new variants is inevitable as long as SARS-CoV-2 transmission continues at scale,"" Jewell wrote. ""In other regions--especially in low-income and middle-income countries that could face longer waits to control their epidemics through vaccination--methods of real-time monitoring of symptoms and disease characteristics, similar to the COVID Symptom Study, could help to identify potentially important changes in symptomatology, transmissibility, mortality, or vaccine avoidance as early as possible.""","B.1.1.7 variant more transmissible but does not increase disease severity, two new studies suggest"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/30/health/covid-vaccine-questions-when/index.html,"CNN The first coronavirus vaccines are out - delivered by FedEx and UPS to hospitals across the country and into the arms of health care workers in hospitals in large cities such as New York and Washington, DC. Boxes filled with dry ice and vaccine have been delivered to Kentucky and Louisiana, Michigan and Arizona. It almost sounds as if people will be lining up everywhere before New Year's to get a vaccine. But while millions of health care workers and residents of nursing homes may get immunized against the virus before the end of the year, the rest of the population is going to have to wait for months. Healthy adults under the age of 65 and children may well have to wait until late spring or even the summer, depending on how many vaccines get approved, how quickly they can be manufactured and distributed, and how the debate goes over allocation. Here's a look at what to expect from the coming coronavirus vaccination campaign. Who can get a vaccine and when?   December is a month for some big decisions. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices has voted to recommend that 21 million frontline health care workers and support staff and 3 million residents of long-term care facilities who have been hardest hit by the pandemic be in the first group. It will be easiest to vaccinate these groups - they're already in institutional settings and the nursing home residents can get vaccinated at the same time their caregivers are being immunized. This decision is being made even before the US Food and Drug Administration has authorized a vaccine. The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisers - the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee - for December 10 to consider emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine, and another meeting on December 17 to discuss Moderna's vaccine. The FDA has promised to consider the committee's advice before deciding on any vaccine. The committee is made up of outside experts who do not have a stake in any of the companies making coronavirus vaccines and who are independent of the federal government. FDA officials say their decisions on the vaccines could come days to weeks after the meetings - it depends on what questions come up. But in the fastest scenario, the FDA could give emergency use authorization (EUA) as soon as next week for Pfizer's vaccine, and the federal government's Operation Warp Speed has promised to start delivering vaccines within 24 hours after that. Potentially, the same thing could happen the following week with Moderna's vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna started making vaccine even while they were still testing it and between them plan to have 40 million doses for the US market by the end of December. Each vaccine needs two doses, given three to four weeks apart. But it's not all ready to go. ""To give you a sense of numbers: The first week's allocations for the two vaccines with data submitted to the FDA are approximately 6.4 million doses of Pfizer and 12.5 million doses of Moderna,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said December 3. ""We'll send half of those doses initially to ensure that the second dose requirements are available, 21 and 28 days later.""   If two or more vaccines get approved by the FDA, January might be when discussion really starts on who can get vaccinated and when. Dr. Larry Corey of the University of Washington, who is heading up coronavirus vaccine clinical trials in the US, has said if both Pfizer and Modern get vaccines authorized, they could supply 50 million more doses in January and 60 million more in February and March. That adds up to 150 million doses - enough to fully vaccinate 75 million people. But there are way more people than that just in the groups tagged as priority groups in the US. The CDC estimates there are 21 million health care personnel, 3 million long-term care residents, 87 million essential workers, 100 million adults with high risk medical conditions and 53 million others 65 and older. Several groups of independent experts have weighed in on how to allocate vaccines, including the They've all laid out basic principles that include protecting the country's health care system, protecting the most vulnerable people, controlling the spread of the virus and being equitable across society. ACIP will need to meet to decide on the details off all these phases. January might include some of the rest of Phase 1 of a Phase 1b is roughed out to include essential workers, including emergency medical technicians, as well as frontline workers at very high risk of infection, such as food workers. This phase may also include older adults living in congregate settings or crowded conditions. There's a also a proposed Phase 1c, which might include people of all ages with underlying conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease who are at significantly higher risk of dying or getting severely ill from Covid-19.   By February, states may have hit their stride on vaccinating residents. Vaccination campaigns may  move beyond hospitals and nursing homes, rehabilitation centers and other such facilities to pharmacies and medical practices. More vaccines may be authorized or at least ready for authorization by January or February. It's clear that Moderna and Pfizer alone cannot cover the US population. AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax all have vaccines in Phase 3 trials, the last stage before seeking authorization or approval. AstraZeneca is likely to seek US approval by January. Johnson & Johnson has said it will have efficacy data by January or February. Novavax is a little farther behind, but all of these companies will also be producing vaccines while testing goes on and might be adding to the count.  It's possible that the US will still be in Phase 1 of vaccination in March, simply because of the sheer numbers involved. Anyone healthy and under 65 who is not an essential or high-risk worker would not be thinking about vaccination yet.  If more vaccines have been approved and brought online, it's possible Phase 2 of vaccination could begin by now. This group has not been decided yet, but Phase 2 might include K-12 teachers and staff and other child care workers, as well as other critical workers such as retail workers and transportation workers. This group could also include people in homeless shelters and all people over 65 who were not already included in phase 1. April is the beginning of the second quarter of the year and CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told the Senate in August he did not think the general public would be able to get vaccinated until the ""late second quarter, third quarter 2021."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has a rosier forecast. ""I had been saying by my calculation, sometime by the end of March, the beginning of April that the normal healthy man and woman in the street, who has no underlying conditions, would likely get it,"" Fauci told MSNBC on December 14, the day the first vaccines rolled out. Fauci said that by the second quarter of 2021, the US could see the ""overwhelming majority of the population vaccinated.""  Young adults and children would have to wait until Phase 3 and under other scenarios that's likely to be May at the soonest - perhaps June or later, depending on what ACIP decides, what the vaccine supply looks like and how smoothly distribution is going. How much will it cost me? The federal government has promised that any coronavirus vaccine will be provided free of charge to the American public. That would be very unlikely to change under a Biden administration. The federal government has paid $7.76 billion upfront to four companies alone for their vaccines; Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax, and tens of millions more upfront or in options to three other companies to guarantee they can develop coronavirus vaccines. ""We've paid for the vaccines, we paid for the shipping costs, and the administration costs ... will be covered by healthcare payers, private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and our program to cover Covid-19 expenses for the uninsured,"" Azar said December 3. Where will I get it? Hospital and health care workers will get the vaccine at their workplaces. They're already set up to deliver vaccines. So will nursing home and long-term care facility residents and, when the time comes, residents of other congregate facilities such as assisted living and senior living homes. Pharmacy chains and big-box stores are also gearing up to deliver vaccines - think any place people normally get flu shots, including grocery store pharmacies and, of course, physician offices. School clinics may also be considered, especially in states where community clinics have been installed in schools. Can it make me sick? People who have tested out the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have reported they can sometimes have a kick - causing soreness at the injection site and maybe a feeling of general malaise for a day or so. Vaccine experts say that's a sign the vaccine is working, causing the immune system to rev up and generate a response. There's not much information about the other vaccines but AstraZeneca, after two scares, says it has recorded no serious side-effects among its volunteers. The FDA and companies will have extensive systems for reporting side-effects. But none of the vaccines being tested for the US market uses even a piece of the real coronavirus, so there is no way they could give you a coronavirus infection. Which vaccine should I get? At first there will be little choice - both Pfizer and Moderna are providing a new type of immunization called an mRNA vaccine. It's considered especially safe because it does not use a whole virus - just a piece of genetic material - and both seem especially effective, providing 95% protection against symptomatic disease. What's not known is how long that protection might last, whether either vaccine protects against asymptomatic disease and whether either stops people from spreading the virus to others. Vaccines coming later might offer harder choices. AstraZeneca's vaccine uses what's called a replication deficient virus to deliver a piece of genetic material from the coronavirus. So does Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. There's not a lot of safety data about these vaccines yet, and no evidence the viral vectors could be harmful. Nonetheless, some doctors may be reluctant to offer them to patients with compromised immune systems, including those with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis who are taking immune-suppressing drugs; pregnant women; people taking certain cancer treatments and others. What hiccups might get in the way? All these plans assume the states, which are in charge of distributing vaccines, get some money to do it. So far, Congress has not allocated any money for vaccine distribution. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has estimated the states need $30 billion to get vaccine distribution plans into place. And a US Government Accountability Office report issued in November found",When can I get a coronavirus vaccine?
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/08/politics/pentagon-vaccine-rollout/index.html,"CNN The Pentagon has drafted a list of the groups that it will provide the Officials have said that the Defense Department will receive a tranche of the vaccine and has been delegated responsibility to decide who will receive it. The military is expected to initially receive significantly fewer vaccine doses than there are military and civilian personnel working for the US Department of Defense, meaning they have to prioritize who will get the initial doses. The list of senior leaders to receive the vaccine will likely include acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. The senior leaders are being prioritized due to their seniority but they are also at higher risk from the virus because they are older than the average military service member. Miller is 55 and Milley 62. It was not clear whether the list of priority recipients had been finalized, but the draft seen by CNN Tuesday has been widely circulated within the Defense Department. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on the draft. The vaccine rollout could begin soon with the Food and Drug Administration due to meet on Thursday to consider approving the authorization of Pfizer's vaccine. The Pentagon list is divided into three ""phases,"" and several sub-phases. The first phase will involve the vaccination of ""health care providers, health care support, emergency services and public safety personnel."" Personnel working in intensive care units, emergency rooms, urgent care centers and first responders - such as emergency medical services, police, search and rescue and firefighters - will be among the first to receive the vaccine. Residents in Armed Forces retirement homes will also fall into this first category. The coronavirus has proven deadly to nursing home communities. The next priority group will include in-patient health care and support personnel as identified by their institutions. National Guard and Reserve personnel on active duty supporting Covid response efforts, patient care, Urban Augmentation Military Task Forces supporting civilian hospitals, and administering of the vaccines or testing will be next to receive the vaccine. Thousands of National Guard and Reserve personnel have been called up to support virus response efforts across the country. After the vaccination of military health care workers, the next high priority group - designated Phase 1b.1 - will include ""Critical National Capabilities"" such as strategic and nuclear deterrence forces, homeland defense forces, ""national leadership/senior staff as defined by Joint and Service staff principals,"" the Special Operations Command national mission force, and the Cyber Command national mission force. After senior leaders and elite units are vaccinated, the next group to receive the vaccine will include personnel preparing to deploy within the next three months, including military, civilian and contractors who would normally receive Defense Department vaccines in pre-deployment. The next group to receive the vaccine will include ""other critical and essential defense department personnel,"" including select members of the military, staff working in Defense Department schools, child and youth services, and food handlers on military installations. Phase 2 will include ""high risk"" beneficiaries, and Phase 3 healthy uniformed military personnel.",Pentagon planning to prioritize medical personnel then senior leaders in coronavirus vaccine rollout
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/04/health/political-differences-with-loved-ones-wellness/index.html,"CNN Millions of people will sit down at the Thanksgiving table this week across from family members on the opposite side of the political divide. If talk turns to the election, it could easily become a testy turkey day. Yet these are people we care about. Isn't there a way to communicate that allows both sides to be heard without further tearing our relationships apart? Absolutely, experts say. Here are eight suggestions on how to bridge the gap. Ask yourself: Why am I doing this? ""In terms of deciding whether or not you want to have a conversation with somebody across political lines, it is important to be aware of what your own motivations are,"" said Tania Israel, author of "" ""If your goal is to change the other person's mind in one conversation, you're going to be really disappointed, because you're not likely to be that effective,"" cautioned Vaile Wright, American Psychological Association's senior director of health care innovation. It can help to keep your relationship with that other person top of mind, suggests Jacksonville, Florida, clinical psychologist Nina Silander, who has written about the ""Think about why it is you care about this person, or why you like them or appreciate them,"" Silander said. That can soften your response and help you ""better articulate your perspective and lend credence to their viewpoint."" Try curiosity first Avoid approaching the exchange with a list of talking points or facts in mind, experts suggest. Instead, you want to ask questions and truly understand the response. ""The most important thing you can do is to listen to the other person,"" advised Israel, a professor in the department of counseling, clinical and school psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. To do that, enter the conversation with simple curiosity, she advised. ""Being curious about where they're coming from and trying to understand where they're coming from helps set people's expectations (about the outcome of the talk) more appropriately,"" Israel said. Be prepared to listen, not talk To do that, you may have to learn and practice some new (or rusty) skills, the type taught in marriage counseling, for example. Repeating back what you think you heard and asking questions are techniques known to elicit clarifications, as your loved one realizes either they misspoke or you misunderstood. ""Minimizing misunderstanding is incredibly important - repeating back what we think we've heard, asking questions to clarify, looking and really striving for opportunities to share and find common ground can go a long way,"" Silander said. ""It helps you to really listen if you know that you're going to need to summarize,"" Israel added. ""It's also going to help them to feel more understood, and that's going to help to create that connection and keep the entire conversation on a calmer level."" Go a step further and acknowledge the other position, Silander suggests. ""Trying to understand someone else's position, or trying to see the world through their eyes is what we call in developmental psychology, 'theory of mind.' It's something we learn to do between four and five years of age - understanding that other people can see things differently,"" Silander said. Using ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements is another important way to facilitate dialogue, Wright said. ""For example, you could say 'I have a lot of concerns about this election, and how it might affect health care because I have a preexisting condition.' Keep it about you and your feelings and about the policies, not the people,"" Wright added. Experts CNN spoke to point out that these skills not only will help better our dialogue across political lines, but in our daily lives as well. ""They're also going to help us to be better parents, better partners, better community members and coworkers,"" Wright said. Beware the minefield of human nature Expect to feel an emotional flare-up when you hear things you don't like. It's part of being human, an ancient and automatic reaction to any perceived threat to our well-being. ""It turns out that our bodies don't necessarily know the difference between the saber-toothed Our sympathetic nervous system goes into action when we perceive a threat, flooding the body with adrenaline and other stress hormones. Key signs of that reaction can be a racing heart, tense muscles, even a flushed face. ""We are ready to fight or to run away from the threat,"" Israel said. Such reactions to politics can even harm our health, research has found. The hospitalization rate for heart attack and stroke in a major California health system was 1.62 times higher in the two days immediately after the 2016 presidential election than the same two days the week before, a ""This is a wake-up call,"" said study author David Williams, chair of the department of social and behavioral sciences and ""We need to pay greater attention to the ways in which stress linked to political campaigns, rhetoric and election outcomes can directly harm health."" Ground yourself It's possible to interrupt our natural tendency to become stressed and anxious by using grounding techniques as soon as we feel ourselves tensing, psychologists say. '""We can do deep breathing,"" Israel said. ""We can physically ground ourselves by noticing the feeling of the chair underneath us or by touching our own arm and paying attention to that."" Set yourself up for success by making sure you're in top mental shape for the conversation, Wright suggests. ""It's not great to have these conversations at the end of a long, hard day, or when people have been drinking or a situation where you're not as emotionally in control as as you'd like to be,"" she warned. Beware of tribal urges It's natural for people to want to be in groups with similar viewpoints, or to ""find our tribe,"" experts say. ""During an election year, we can become rather tribal, and that can be inflamed by media, it can be flamed by special interest groups, and it caters to our own human nature,"" Silander said. ""The people media choose for spokespeople usually are more extreme in their views, but it's also our basic psychology that we tend to have these distorted perceptions of people who we see as being different from ourselves,"" Israel said. This instinctual feeling of ""us versus them"" intensifies with divisive rhetoric, Wright said, which can lead us to label people in ways that make it difficult to find common ground. ""It isn't just that you and I have differences on how the educational system should run,"" Wright said. ""It becomes 'You don't care about teachers, you don't care about kids.' It becomes not about the issue, but about you as a person and your values."" Try to find common ground To combat that, Silander suggests learning about the fundamental value differences between liberals and conservatives in an objective and considerate way. ""It really enables us to better understand and empathize with one another,"" Silander said. ""And we can start to see that maybe we often share concerns that are more similar in nature than we would have thought, even if we disagree with what solutions to those concerns would look like."" As an example, Silander points to civil rights issues as a way for liberals to try to understand why some conservatives believe mandates to wear masks are an infringement on personal liberties. ""The underlying theme or principle can at least be one way to relate even if we disagree,"" she said. Join a group and practice Practice makes perfect, as they say. Over the last four years, groups of people dedicated to bringing political opposites together have sprung up around the country. Joining a training - such as those offered by ""The concept of a better argument is really all about caring more about one another than we do about our opinion on a specific subject,"" explained Caroline Hopper, managing director of the Citizenship & American Identity Program at The Aspen Institute, which oversees the program along with The Allstate Corporation and educational nonprofit If we politely ignore our differences - especially with those closest to us - we are ""giving up our public discourse, our family discourse, to the voices that are the most polarized,"" Hopper said. ""We're not going to be able to seek any kind of informed solutions together because we're not getting the full scope of information that we need,"" she added. ""To make our democracy work, we really need to be engaged with each other,"" Silander said. ""I honestly think we are stronger If we can find ways of listening to each other and connecting and working together. I hope that we will take those opportunities no matter what the outcome of the election is.""",How to talk politics with angry loved ones who disagree with you

It's no shock that many of us reach for cookies, candy, chips and other indulgences during stressful times, whether it's due to the pandemic, the resulting economic downtown or a divisive US election. Snack food consumption, including both sweet and savory snacks, increased by 8% during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to consumer research company That's much more than during the Great Recession, between 2008 and 2010, where snack foods increased by 1%, or 4.8 billion eatings. (An ""eating"" is defined as one occasion that involves eating a meal or a snack.) ""I think the increase in snacking was so pronounced now versus the last recession because this downturn came upon us so suddenly,"" said Darren Seifer, food industry analyst at The NPD Group, via email. ""At the beginning of the lockdowns, consumers had to make decisions on how to feed their families in a matter of weeks, while the last recession took months to fully take its grip,"" Seifer said. ""Consumers quickly stocked up on snacks and indulgent foods for their shelf lives while others were stress eating."" ""I see the rise in snack consumption as the result of lockdown boredom and pandemic and But excess snacking translates to excess calories. ""The more snacks, the more calories they provide,"" Nestle said. ""More calories means more pounds unless snackers compensate by eating less at meals."" Reaching for comfort foods is soothing and can be a way to cope with life's uncertainties and challenges. But if you feel your snacking has become an unhealthy habit, here are seven strategies to snack better.  By assigning levels to your hunger (for example, ""1"" being ravenous and ""9"" being Thanksgiving day stuffed), the meter can help guide you as to what to eat, and can be especially helpful if impulsive or stress-related eating has become problematic. For example, if you are a ""4,"" on the hunger meter (that is, not that hungry, but ""snacky""), you might need a piece of fruit with a small handful of nuts. But if you are a ""1,"" you probably need a full meal.   The next time you snack, try chewing slowly and savor every bite. This will help make snacking a lot more pleasurable.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/01/health/children-screen-time-increase-pandemic-study-wellness/index.html,"CNN Children are racking up hours of screen time since the pandemic began, and there doesn't appear to be an end in sight. Adolescents reported that they spent nearly eight hours a day in front of a screen, double their pre-pandemic estimates of nearly four hours per day, according to a study published Monday in Kids' screen time did not include time spent online for virtual classes. The study focused on recreational activities like streaming, gaming, social media, texting, video chatting and surfing the web. Adolescents who reported more screen time also reported suffering in other areas of their lives, said lead study author Dr. Jason Nagata, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California in San Francisco. Screen use and mental health ""More screen time was linked to poorer mental health and greater stress among teens,"" Nagata said. Some 5,412 adolescents between the ages of 10 and 14 years old were asked about their screen-time habits. Researchers found the children spent an average of 7.7 hours a day in front of a screen, up from pre-pandemic estimates of 3.8 hours per day. Participants were asked to rank their mental health from ""much worse"" to ""much better"" compared to the previous week. They were also asked four questions about their perceived stress, such as ""In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?"" The link between higher screen usage and stress was surprising, said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a practicing developmental behavioral pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at Michigan Medicine C.S.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/04/health/coronavirus-vaccine-acip-nursing-homes-question/index.html,"CNN The vote to recommend long-term care residents be among the first to receive Covid-19 vaccinations was not unanimous. Out of a panel of 14 CDC vaccine advisers, a lone doctor said no. ""Odd woman out, I guess,"" Dr. Helen ""Keipp"" Talbot, of Vanderbilt University, told her colleagues. ""I still struggle with this. This was not an easy vote."" Talbot was worried about whether the vaccine would even work in such frail, vulnerable patients. Even more, she worried about how it might look if the vaccine failed in that group, or how it would affect public perception if residents died soon after getting the vaccine. On the other hand, these are the people worst hit by the pandemic. They make up 40% of all deaths so far. Nursing homes in the Midwest have been particularly hard hit, with a more than 400% increase in weekly cases since mid-September, according to a report published Tuesday by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living. During the week of November 15, 49% of new nursing home cases were in the Midwest. Between mid-September and the week of November 15, there was a 177% rise in new weekly nursing home cases nationwide. The rise in cases has been accompanied by a rise in coronavirus deaths in nursing homes. ""Our worst fears have come true as Covid runs rampant among the general population, and long term care facilities are powerless to fully prevent it from entering due to its asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread,"" said Mark Parkinson, the organization's president and CEO. Simpler logistics From a practical standpoint the reason to vaccinate is simple. It is much easier to send a team to a facility and vaccinate everyone who works and lives there at the same time than it is to vaccinate the two groups at different times. Since the vaccine requires two doses, the vaccinators already have to return about 21 days later as it is. ""That's two trips versus four trips, at a minimum,"" said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, which is supporting frontline workers who will administer Covid-19 vaccinations. ""From a practical standpoint of how quickly can we get people vaccinated who need it, it simply simplifies the logistics drastically because people in long-term care can't actually go to a vaccination place. You have to bring the vaccine to them. And so it's much easier if we can vaccinate everyone who needs it on one trip, instead of having to make multiple trips at different times to the same facility over and over."" From a medical standpoint the reason to vaccinate long-term care residents is more complex. They are the group of Covid-19 patients with the highest mortality rate, and many of the hospitalizations are people who are from long-term care facilities who contract Covid-19 and are hospitalized. When they get sick, it generates a lot of burden on hospitals. ""Those are all very good reasons to vaccinate the residents,"" Moore said. But there is also reason for concern. The Covid-19 vaccines have not been tested in the frail elderly, many of whom are residents of long-term care facilities. ""Since they haven't been studied in people in those populations, we don't know how well the vaccine will work for them. We know that most vaccines don't work nearly as well in a frail elderly person as they would in someone who is fit and vigorous, even if they happen to be the same age,"" Moore said. ""There's a question about the direct benefit of the vaccine, if given to people who live in those facilities, because we haven't studied how well it works in that group yet."" It's this uncertainty that led Talbot to vote no. ""I have spent my career studying vaccines in older adults. And we have traditionally tried a vaccine in a young healthy population and then hoped it works in our frail older adults,"" she told the committee ahead of her vote. ""And so we enter this realm of 'we hope it works, and we hope it's safe,' and that concerns me on many levels."" When shots begin to go into arms of residents, Moore said Americans need to understand that deaths may occur that won't necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine. ""We would not at all be surprised to see, coincidentally, vaccination happening and then having someone pass away a short time after they receive a vaccine, not because it has anything to do with the vaccination but just because that's the place where people at the end of their lives reside,"" Moore said. ""One of the things we want to make sure people understand is that they should not be unnecessarily alarmed if there are reports, once we start vaccinating, of someone or multiple people dying within a day or two of their vaccination who are residents of a long-term care facility. That would be something we would expect, as a normal occurrence, because people die frequently in nursing homes."" On Tuesday, the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living applauded the CDC advisory committee's 13-1 vote to recommend prioritizing their residents. ""More than 100,000 long term care residents have died from this virus in the U.S. and our nursing homes are now experiencing the worst outbreak of new cases since last spring with more than 2,000 residents succumbing to this virus each week,"" said Parkinson. ""We are extremely hopeful this vaccine will literally be a lifesaver for thousands of residents."" Some state governors have begun to indicate that they will follow the CDC's priorities for distributing the vaccine to both healthcare workers and long-term residents. In Georgia, more than 95% of nursing homes in the state have enrolled with the CDC through partnerships with CVS and Walgreens for vaccine rollout and distribution. Nationwide, CVS is preparing to administer Covid-19 vaccinations to approximately 2 million long-term care facility residents, according to Chris Cox, senior vice president of CVS Health. Walgreens is preparing to administer the vaccine to approximately 1 million long-term care facility residents, according to Rick Gates, senior vice president of pharmacy and healthcare at Walgreens. The pharmacy chains plan to store the vaccine at approximately 1,900 ""hubs"" across the country and then distribute it to more than 48,000 long-term care facilities nationwide. CVS chief medical officer Dr. Troy Brennan, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Thursday their plan is to be ready to go as early as December 15. ""We're working with each of the states now, and it will be challenging because each state will be different,"" Brennan said. ""Some states will say just vaccinate the people in the skilled nursing facility. Some states will want us to vaccinate not only the people in the skilled nursing facility but the healthcare workers in those facilities, so those kinds of details are going to vary from state to state."" Ending the isolation The debate on whether to vaccinate residents of long-term care facilities, and the planning to get the vaccinations done, has occurred as the residents themselves have been largely isolated from family and friends in facilities that have been closed to visitors. In addition to saving lives, Parkinson said he hopes the vaccine will ""expedite the reopening of our facilities to family members and loved ones."" But when that will happen remains unknown. ""The most pressing issue at the moment is ensuring that all long term care staff and residents are the first priority for a vaccine. Long term care facilities will not be able to have any sense of normalcy until a vaccine is administered, and we know that everyone is eager for that to happen,"" said Cristina Crawford, a spokesperson for the American Health Care Association, in an email to CNN. ""We hope to be able to discuss what next steps look like once a vaccine is being delivered and administered to staff and residents across the country."" Moore said not to expect a change in policy out of the gate. ""Right now, we just don't have the data to know how well the vaccines will work in these folks, and so we're going to need to be cautious at first because we know they are by far the most vulnerable to severe illness and death from Covid. We're going to  play it really carefully until we know for sure that these vaccines will really be effective at protecting them,"" Moore said. ""As we learn more and we see if the vaccine works really well in these groups, then certainly my hope is that we can help these folks reconnect with their families because they need each other.""",Why vaccinate our most frail?

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/12/health/skip-thanksgiving-covid-wellness/index.html,"CNN Thanksgiving has always been a big deal for Sara Wellensiek and her family. Every year, the Phoenix All told, Wellensiek estimated her fivesome probably has close contact with between 20 and 30 other people over the course of the week -- not counting interactions with strangers on planes, in stadiums and around town. This year, however, the family will see almost nobody. Because they're not even planning to leave the house. The reason for this change in plans: the Covid-19 pandemic. Like many people, Wellensiek said she doesn't want to risk getting the virus or giving it to people she loves. She also doesn't want to contribute to another spike of cases in her community. ""We choose to stay home to protect ourselves, our family and friends, and the community at large,"" she said via email. ""Without the Covid pandemic, our plans would not have changed."" Wellensiek's concerns are shared by many others. Across the country, many people are responding to the pandemic by making similar decisions about this US holiday. None of these choices is easy, and managing feelings about skipping annual family Thanksgiving traditions can be hard. Communicating your decision clearly and thoughtfully can be the toughest task of all. Note the rules Before you can accept or decline a Thanksgiving invite, it's important to figure out how to stay safe. On November 11, the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Long, indoor gatherings with lots of people pose more of a risk than short, outdoor shindigs with a select few, the CDC noted. Another factor: the number and rate of Covid-19 cases in the community of celebration. In most states, In areas where these numbers are rising, gatherings bring with them much greater potential risk, said Dr. Ramon Tallaj, founder and chairman of Somos Community Care, a network of health care providers serving New York City. ""You have to be smart,"" said Tallaj, who helped implement citywide treatment protocols when New York was a Covid hotspot this spring. ""If cases are on the rise in your area, don't do it. If you're going to celebrate in a small apartment with lots of people, don't do it. We have pushed so many other things off and this should be no different. Really, what's another year?"" Focus on your safety If you opt to bail on tradition this year, etiquette experts said it's a good idea to express your choice as a personal one. Using ""I statements,"" or statements that start with the first-person pronoun, make clear to loved ones that your decision has nothing to do with them, said Kianga Kelley-Crowley, founder and owner of Simply a Lady, an etiquette and communications consulting company in Wichita, Kansas. ""It's all right to say, 'I prefer not to get together with everyone,' or 'I'm sorry but we're not going to be able to attend this year,'"" she said. ""Take responsibility for your decision. Own it. Speak the truth to your family members. It's perfectly acceptable to say you're focusing on your own safety and would rather stay home."" Lisa Mirza Grotts, who calls herself the The etiquette expert said she has focused on explaining her decisions only in terms of potential danger -- nothing else. This approach has made it easier for her to communicate unpleasant news, she noted. ""When you share your feelings in the context of risk -- 'I don't want to be a virus spreader and put others at risk' -- the sentiment is very straightforward,"" said Grotts, who is based in San Francisco. ""This is one of the easiest outs there ever will be. It's not about you. It's about others and what you can do to them."" Managing the feelings All that said, families are complicated, and altering an age-old tradition could put you at risk of hurting someone's feelings inadvertently. It's incredibly uncomfortable to say, ""No, thank you"" to people with whom you generally have a history of agreeing, said Sharman Regensburg, a psychotherapist in East Northport, New York. Charged interactions with family members, she noted, could lead to other conflicts or create serious internal pressure -- both situations that also can be difficult to navigate. Still, she said, particularly when it comes to your own health, you must speak your mind. ""In scenarios like this one there rarely is one right answer,"" Regensburg said. ""You have to do what you think is best, follow your heart, be respectful in doing so. But also accept that by declining the invitation, you could be alienating that family member for years."" While it's perfectly normal that declining Thanksgiving plans would leave you feeling sad, Regensburg said that the emotion of guilt in this case likely represents something else. ""You can acknowledge you're sad and disappointed, but if you feel guilt, you're probably feeling angry that your loved one isn't honoring your wishes,"" she said. ""Usually guilt is what you feel when you've done something you probably shouldn't have done. In this case, there's nothing wrong about declining the invite, so there shouldn't be guilt."" Giving thanks differently There are plenty of alternatives to getting together with family members for a traditional Thanksgiving celebration this year. If you're interested in pursuing other options, you can find something that works for everyone. Perhaps the easiest of the bunch is to follow in the footsteps of most workplaces and embrace a virtual holiday. Here, one family member can assume the role of party planner and set up the meeting, send out invites and serve as ""host"" for the live event. On a basic level, participants can have the virtual shindig running during their respective dinners, so everyone feels like they're sitting at the table together. For a more sophisticated approach, Kianga Kelley-Crowley suggested distributing prepackaged meals in advance, so everyone is eating the same thing at the same time, together over Zoom.  As a way to say ""We are thinking of you"" to her usual holiday co-celebrants, Grotts said she was buying them a complete Thanksgiving dinner from a supermarket in their area. As Tallaj suggested, an in-person gathering can work, too -- so long as the event is held outside and all parties wear face coverings, engage in physical distancing of at least 6 feet, and practice good hand hygiene. To pave the way for this type of gathering, clinical psychologist Angela Waldrop said it may be necessary to ask family members some pointed questions about how well they've been keeping safe. Waldrop likened this questionnaire to the same kind of interview someone might give a new sexual partner. Some of these questions include: How frequently have you come into close contact with people outside of your household? To what extent are you wearing facial coverings and maintaining safe distance from others when you are out and about? Where outside your immediate neighborhood have you traveled in the last month? She added that it's important loved ones understand why you're asking. ""It's like interviewing them about where they've been and who they've slept with,"" said Waldrop, who's based in San Francisco. ""We can't control each other, but we're within our rights to ask -- especially during a pandemic.""",How to decline Thanksgiving in the name of Covid
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/health/south-africa-sequencing-coronavirus-variant/index.html,"CNN The discovery of important new coronavirus variants in the UK and South Africa began with a bet of a bottle of wine. In mid-November, Tulio de Oliveira, who leads a genetics lab in South Africa, began receiving anxious phone calls from physicians in the Eastern Cape province who were seeing an explosive growth in Covid-19 patients. Hospitals were quickly becoming overrun. The increase had seemingly come out of nowhere. ""It was shocking,"" said de Oliveira, a professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban. De Oliveira immediately asked for samples of the virus from patients' noses so he could genetically sequence them. In less than a week, he sequenced 16 samples. All 16 had similar mutations - and an unusually high number of mutations. ""I said to myself, 'there's something very strange here,' "" de Oliveira said. De Oliveira, a prominent virus hunter, had discovered a new variant of the coronavirus. The 16 samples were hundreds of kilometers apart from each other in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, so he had a hunch the variant was spreading quickly. To add to the concerns, some of the mutations were in the genes related to the spikes that sit atop the virus. Tests to detect the virus, as well as Covid-19 drugs and vaccines, have targeted those spikes. The concern is that if the spikes change, it's possible that tests, drugs and vaccines might not work as well. In the next step of his virus hunt, de Oliveira reached out to labs in the One of the labs was in Stellenbosch, a town that's home to South Africa's famed wineries. De Oliveira said Susan Engelbrecht, the senior scientist at the Stellenbosch lab, told him she'd be shocked if the new variant had reached her area, since it's more than 700 kilometers away from Nelson Mandela Bay, where the spread of the variant was first spotted. ""I made a bet with her, that if we found the variant in more than 50% of the samples from Stellenbosch, she would give me a bottle of wine,"" de Oliveira said. ""She said not only would she give me bottle of wine, she would eat her hat, too."" Of the 67 samples from Stellenbosch, 58 were the same variant found in Nelson Mandela Bay. De Oliveira is considering which Stellenbosch wine he'll choose - but he knows it will be an expensive one. A few days later, on December 4, de Oliveira sent an urgent email to the World Health Organization official who runs the agency's SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group. ""I would like to request an urgent addition to the agenda today - to raise an alert of some preliminary findings from South Africa,"" de Oliveira wrote. Permission was granted, and de Oliveira alerted the other scientists on the call, who hailed from around the world, about this strange new variant he was seeing in South Africa. He noted that it included a mutation in a position of the spike protein called N501Y, and he encouraged his colleagues to look for similar mutations in their countries. Andrew Rambaut, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, took up the task. He and his colleagues looked in the UK's genomic database and found a variant containing the N501Y mutation, which was spreading quickly in parts of southeast England. They published That day, Rambaut Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the WHO's coronavirus response, said de Oliveira's discovery ""definitely triggered [British scientists] to look at the different type of variants."" ""I'm just so grateful that we have this [international] collaboration,"" she said. 'We're playing a very dangerous game with this virus' If a virus changes its genetics in just the right way, tests might not be able to detect it as easily, and vaccines might not work as well. ""We're playing a very dangerous game with this virus right now,"" Van Kerkhove said, given the explosive growth in the United States and other countries. ""What worries us is that the longer this spreads, the more opportunities it has to change."" These variants were found in South Africa and the UK, but it's not clear where they began. So far, it appears that both spread more quickly, but they are not more deadly. Vaccine makers and other scientists are studying whether the variants pose a challenge to the vaccines. Keeping an eye on the virus - genetically sequencing samples from large numbers of people - is ""a fundamental aspect of controlling the virus"" and an important way ""to understand your enemy,"" Van Kerkhove said. Trevor Bedford, a genomic epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, gives the example of how genetic sequencing this summer helped link 59 Covid-19 cases in various parts of ""The sequencing really kind of clinched it,"" Bedford said. Sequencing the coronavirus in the US On December 20, the day the British scientists published their findings, a Slack group for US virus hunters lit up. Perhaps the UK and South Africa variants or other worrisome mutations existed in the United States, too. ""That kind of definitely lit a fire under people,"" said Bedford, who's a member of a Slack group for So far in the pandemic, US genomic sequencing has lagged behind other countries. For example, the UK has sequenced virus samples from about 146,000 people, and the US has sequenced samples from only 58,000 people, according to the Watching other countries, like the UK and South Africa, excel at genomic sequencing can be hard, Bedford said. ""Of course, it's frustrating,"" he said. In South Africa, once de Oliveira got the tip from physicians that case numbers were growing, it took him and his colleagues only about two weeks to identify the new variant. Once British researchers got the tip from de Oliveira, it took them less than three weeks to find their own variant and publish their study. Things don't move that quickly in the US, Bedford said. In the United States, the labs that have coronavirus samples from patients often don't work directly with the scientists who will sequence those samples. That means the scientists have to identify those labs, ask them to save samples, and then make legal agreements for sharing the samples. ""Part of the reason that we're doing such a bad job is we have [these] structural issues,"" Bedford said. South Africa and the UK, on the other hand, have national health services, so the labs that do Covid-19 testing and the experts that do sequencing typically work for the same entity. ""They've got a single national health system and a single national microbiology service, which makes coordinating things a lot easier,"" said Dr. Gregory Armstrong, director of the Office of Advanced Molecular Detection at the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. ""We don't have a system that's anywhere near as robust as the UK system."" Another reason the US lags behind is that the UK has invested huge sums of money in genomic sequencing. ""The system in the UK is really the gold standard for how to do genomic surveillance,"" Armstrong said. ""I don't think we're ever going to be able to get up to that level."" The The CDC's goal is to more than double the number of coronavirus genomes sequenced in the US, Armstrong said. The sequencing is done in labs at the CDC, state health departments, universities and private companies. The US is now sequencing about 3,000 samples a week, and the CDC hopes in the next two weeks to more than double that to about 6,500 per week, he said. Scientists around the world are eager to see the change.

An epidemic could have the opposite effect. ""If you're trying to rebalance the Chinese economy, this is one of the last events you want to see,"" said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group. The world's second biggest economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades last year as it contended with rising debt, cooling domestic demand and Most of the tariffs Washington imposed on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods haven't gone away, said ING economist Robert Carnell, adding that Beijing has already nudged ""every policy lever that could be nudged"" The Wright called the timing of the outbreak ""especially unfortunate"" given the Lunar New Year holiday. The period is The spread of the virus prompted Chinese officials to take the largely unprecedented step of partially locking down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China where the virus originated. Airline regulators have also instructed Chinese carriers to offer free cancellations on flights into Wuhan, while state media has reported that China's rail authorities are taking similar steps. A SARS-like scenario China has a good sense of the economic The Like SARS, the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak could spark widespread fear and spur people to hunker down and avoid going outside. That kind of behavior would deal a huge blow to the service sector, which now accounts for about 52% of the Chinese economy. ""As soon as you're worried, you're worried,"" Carnell said. ""You stay home, if you can. You don't go out to the local food court, you try not to travel on public transport, you try to work from home, you don't travel for pleasure. You don't get on a plane, you don't go to the movie theater, restaurants or conferences."" The SARS outbreak forced the cancellation of the week-long May Day holiday in China, forced the postponement or abandonment of sporting, business and cultural events and Investors are already worried about what the Wuhan virus could mean for China's growing travel industry. Shares of the country's three major airlines -- Air China, China Southern and China Eastern -- all closed down 2.5% or more in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Thursday. And the aviation sector is ""likely to remain under pressure as confirmed cases are set to increase,"" said Andrew Lee, equity analyst at Jefferies. SARS also had a wider impact on the economy. China's annual growth rate slumped to 9.1% in the second quarter of 2003, down from 11.1% in the first quarter of that year, according to brokerage firm Macquarie Group. This time around, the hit to China's GDP could be even worse, because the sectors most directly affected now make up a bigger part of the economy, Commerzbank analyst Hao Zhou and economist Marco Wagner wrote in a research note on Wednesday. For example, tourism accounts for about 5% of China's GDP today, compared to 2% in 2003. ""If history is a guide, there is clearly a risk that the already struggling China's consumption would face further headwinds if the (Wuhan) virus can't be effectively controlled,"" Hao and Wagner wrote. Limiting the economic blow But China is stepping up efforts to contain the virus, ""Rumors and bad information were drowning out good information at that time, and people were especially careful as a result,"" said Wright, adding that he expected the And as scary as the 2003 outbreak was, experts say the impact on China's economy was short-lived.

""It's hard to do this right, as there's a lot you have to account for."" That's why 14 days of very strict precautions prior to traveling is mandatory. ""This means lockdown strict, avoiding any social interaction or going to restaurants, bars and parties for everyone in the household -- parents, too,"" said Gonsenhauser, who helped develop Covid-19 safety protocols for Ohio State students. ""For this to work, everyone in the family has to be willing to make that sacrifice."" Testing also has to be timed smartly, too, with days built in before and after the test to make sure there aren't any false negatives. ""Your student will need to quarantine for three to five days prior to testing and then remain in quarantine until a test comes back negative,"" he said. ""Remember: It can take up to three days after an exposure to test positive."" What's more, keep in mind that the trip home -- whether by car or airplane -- must also be planned out in detail. ""Your student has to take a lot of precautions,"" he said. ""If students have to go home, I'd prefer for them to drive since an airport bathroom has way more possibility of crowding and potential exposure than, say, a highway rest stop. Also, a gas pump or electric charger is easier to clean with a wet wipe than an airplane seat."" Seva Poitevin, a senior at Beloit College in Beloit, Wisconsin, is driving home to her parents' house in Rockford, Illinois, for Thanksgiving. She acknowledges the risks involved with the trip, especially in light of Wisconsin's skyrocketing Covid-19 cases, but she said she has devised a plan to get home safely. ""I'll be tested on campus two days before Thanksgiving and drive home without making any stops,"" she said of the two-hour trip. She'll then remain in quarantine until she tests negative. ""My mom will leave food outside of my bedroom door,"" she said. ""I'm more than happy to do this because it will keep me and my family safe. In fact, I'm planning to do it this way every time I come home until there's a vaccine."" Protecting the older generation Sadly, the grandparents shouldn't be seated at your table this year. ""I know this is emotionally charged and painful, but the last thing we want to see happen is for anyone to take the virus home to older relatives,"" Osterholm said. Renee Milstein's two daughters, both of whom attend Syracuse University, will be tested before they leave campus. The Milsteins' Thanksgiving will likely be a small dinner for four, not one that typically includes extended family. ""My mother has dementia and doesn't go out,"" said Milstein, who lives in Chappaqua, New York. She wants to keep her mother safe. ""I hate to be a downer, but I don't think this should be the year for a big Thanksgiving gathering,"" she said. It's also the year for thinking about the ""we,"" not the ""me,"" when it comes to spending time together, Gosenhauser said. ""If you can't commit to assuring family members that each individual has gotten out of the window of potential transmission, don't get together,"" he said. ""Remember that masking and social distancing at dinner, whether inside or outside, isn't going to be enough of a precaution. Your masks will be down when you're eating and drinking and it's very difficult to socially distance 6 feet apart at a table set for the entire family."" It may be a bitter pill but, in the end, the wisest choice might be for your student to skip the plane or train home and stay on campus. ""To be completely safe, this should be the year we celebrate Thanksgiving on Zoom,"" Osterholm said. ""The best gift all of us can give to our families is to make sure we don't infect each other.""",Will college students bring Covid-19 home for Thanksgiving?

Thousands overall were vaccinated in the UK on Tuesday, NHS England told CNN on Wednesday. ""As is common with new vaccines the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday,"" said Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, in a statement. ""Both are recovering well."" The MHRA issued new advice to health care professionals stating that any person with a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food - such as previous history of anaphylactoid reaction, or those who have been advised to carry an adrenaline autoinjector - should not receive the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine. The advice also states that vaccines ""should only be carried out in facilities where resuscitation measures are available."" ""We are fully investigating the two reports that have been reported to us as a matter of priority,"" an MHRA spokesperson said. ""Once all the information has been reviewed we will communicate updated advice,"" the spokesperson added. They advised anyone with a history of a significant allergic reaction due to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to speak to the health care professional administering the vaccine. Pfizer said in a statement that it had been advised by the UK regulator of ""two yellow card reports that may be associated with allergic reaction"" due to administration of the vaccine. ""As a precautionary measure, the MHRA has issued temporary guidance to the NHS while it conducts an investigation in order to fully understand each case and its causes. Pfizer and BioNTech are supporting the MHRA in the investigation,"" the statement said. ""In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, this vaccine was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concerns reported by the independent Data Monitoring Committee. The trial has enrolled over 44,000 participants to date, over 42,000 of whom have received a second vaccination.""   Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, He said that ""some people won't know if they have hypersensitivity to some constituents of the vaccine."" He backed the MHRA advice for people who carry an EpiPen to delay having a vaccination until the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified. But he said the news did not mean the general public should be anxious. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: ""As with all food and medications, there is a very small chance of an allergic reaction to any vaccine. ""The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well."" Vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit told CNN that allergic reactions to vaccines were not uncommon: ""Certainly, vaccines can cause severe allergic reactions. In the United States, roughly one of every 1.4 million doses of vaccines is complicated by a severe allergic reaction."" He said that rather than a ""blanket recommendation"" for people with allergies, ""the smarter thing to do would be to try and look at these two patients and see what specific component of the vaccine they were allergic to."" Offit said people should realize that there are immediate treatments for allergic reaction. ""That's why you're hanging out in the doctor's office,"" he said, before warning that the reports of allergic reactions ""will only serve as yet another way to scare people."" Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that the authorization and approval process for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine ""has been incredibly robust.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/23/health/covid-vaccine-acip-meeting-discussion/index.html,"CNN Americans need to be prepared for the possibility that they may feel a little unwell after they get a coronavirus vaccine, if one is authorized, members of a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee said Monday. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met to discuss whether to recommend use of any Covid-19 vaccine that the US Food and Drug Administration might authorize. Volunteers in vaccine trials have reported they frequently feel flu-like effects after getting vaccinated, and members of the ACIP - as well as liaison representatives who take part in the discussion - said that could affect people's willingness to get vaccinated in the first place, or to get the second dose of the two-vaccine regimen. ""As a practicing physician, I have got to be sure my patients will come back for the second dose. We really have got to make patients aware that this is not going to be a walk in the park,"" Dr. Sandra Fryhofer of the Emory University School of Medicine, representing the American Medical Association, told the meeting. ""They are going to know they got a vaccine. They are not going to feel wonderful."" The whole point of vaccination is to cause an immune response in the body and that can sometimes cause flu-like symptoms such as body aches, or even fever and a headache. Patricia Stinchfield of Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, representing the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, said providers must be ready to explain this to people getting any vaccine. ""These are immune responses, so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that. And when you do, it's normal that you have some arm soreness or some fatigue or some body aches or even some fever,"" Stinchfield told the meeting. Some people may feel bad enough to need to stay home from work for a day, she said. Dr. Paul Hunter of the city of Milwaukee health department and a voting member of the committee, said it will be important for the first people to get vaccinated to describe these experiences to others. Boosting confidence in a vaccine ""The people who highly value getting the vaccine soon and fast, early, are going to be really helpful to everyone else. And I think we really are going to need to honor them, because they are going to let us know how it feels,"" he said. ""And I think these people are likely to be health care workers who are likely to be up for that kind of task."" Public willingness to get a coronavirus vaccine has been steadily dropping since the spring, but it might improve when people start to hear more about the safety and efficacy of the various vaccines in the works, the CDC's Dr. Sara Oliver told the committee during the five-hour-long meeting. Oliver said the CDC has been looking at various surveys on attitudes and noted that anywhere between 40% and 80% of those surveyed said they'd be willing to get vaccinated. ""Many adults reported intentions to receive Covid vaccine. But concerns were raised around side-effects, unknown efficacy and the speed of the (authorization) process,"" Oliver told the meeting. Vaccine acceptance was highest among Asian-Americans and lowest among African-Americans, Oliver said. That's of concern because ACIP wants to make sure any vaccine that is approved gets to the groups most affected by the pandemic, and Blacks are among the hardest hit by Covid-19. Nurses were also a concern. One survey showed that while nurses agreed vaccines were likely to be safe and effective, only 34% would voluntarily get vaccinated, Oliver said. Members of ACIP said they thought these fears could be addressed with education campaigns and as people learned about data showing that, for example, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were about 95% effective in preventing symptomatic disease with no significant safety concerns. Allocating the vaccine Any plan for distributing coronavirus vaccine should take into account fair and equitable access to everyone--especially groups that are Fair access is at the top of the list, ACIP committee members said in a document published at the start of the meeting. ""How do characteristics of the vaccine and logistical considerations affect fair access for all persons?"" they asked in the document, released in the CDC's MMWR report. ""Does allocation planning include input from groups who are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 or face health inequities resulting from social determinants of health, such as income and health care access?"" The CDC, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and other advisers have proposed four groups that should get vaccinated first: health care personnel, other essential workers, adults with high risk medical conditions and other adults 65 and older. That's a lot of people. The CDC estimates there are 21 million healthcare personnel, 87 million essential workers, 100 million adults with high risk medical conditions and 53 million others are 65 and older. The federal government has said 40 million coronavirus vaccine doses could be available by the end of December. There's little disagreement that frontline healthcare workers should be in the first group -  designated as 1a. At issue is whether residents of long term care facilities should be in this group, also. There's no question it's a highly vulnerable population. ""Long term care facility residents and staff accounted for 6% of cases and 39% of deaths in the US, despite the fact that long term care facility residents account for less than 1% of the US population,"" the CDC's Dr. Kathleen Dooling told the meeting. Plus, it's a group that would be easier to reach if the staff caring for them are already being immunized in the first phase of any vaccine that might get emergency authorization from the FDA. But ACIP member Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot worried that this frail group might do poorly in general and damage faith in the vaccine. ""There is such a high mortality rate in long term care facilities,"" Talbot told the meeting. ""There will be a number of patients who receive immunizations for Covid and will pass away. ""But early on as we're building confidence and we will not be able to show any data to say that it was not due to the vaccine because there's not been a randomized, controlled trial. And I think we're going to have a very striking backlash of 'my grandmother got the vaccine and she passed away,' and they're not likely to be related, but that will become remembered and break some of the confidence in the vaccine."" But others did not think that putting these residents further back in line would help. Hunter said it would be inefficient to vaccinate healthcare workers in the facilities but skip residents. ""Why not vaccinate people that, you know, you, you've got it all set up and ready to go?"" he asked. ""It's an efficiency to vaccinate a bunch of people who could benefit from it."" The ACIP will not make a decision Monday. The group will meet after the FDA's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRPBAC) meets Dec. 10 to discuss","Covid-19 vaccine no 'walk in the park,' CDC committee told"

However, ""trouble is, you go to different parts of the country, and even when the outbreak is clear and hospitals are on the verge of being overrun, there are a substantial proportion of the people who still think that this is not real, that it's fake news or that it's a hoax,"" Fauci said. Fauci has advised six presidents. He said he's never seen anything like this. ""We've got to overcome that and pull together as a nation uniformly with adhering to these public health measures,"" he said at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council summit on Tuesday. That people aren't doing this is ""really extraordinarily frustrating, because we feel strongly that we will be able to have a significant impact,"" he said. The US surpassed 15 million total reported Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, meaning one in 22 Americans has tested positive for the virus. Experts feel the actual number of infections is much higher. Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services Admiral Brett Giroir told CNN people also should try to stay home for the December holidays. ""The end of the pandemic is in sight,"" he said. ""The vaccine will work. It will end the pandemic and return us to as near normal or normal as possible, but we have to do our part right now, which is those mitigations techniques."" Vice President Mike Pence, speaking at a White House vaccine summit, also told  Americans to wear their face coverings and follow other guidelines.

Despite challenges to production and distribution, tens of millions of Americans will be vaccinated by January 20, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in an interview with Axios that aired Monday FDA panel confirms Pfizer vaccine's 95% efficacy rate after 2 doses, in new briefing An advisory committee to the FDA on Tuesday released a document detailing data on Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The document confirms that the vaccine's efficacy against Covid-19 was 95%, occurring at least seven days after the second dose - a rate that had been previously reported by Pfizer. The proposed dosing for this vaccine is two 30-microgram doses 21 days apart. The document also notes that the vaccine appears to provide ""some protection"" against Covid-19 following just one dose. However, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla emphasized Tuesday that the protection after one dose is ""not full,"" and that therefore Pfizer's product is a ""two-dose vaccine."" ""People need to take two doses to be able to feel confident that they're protected at ... 95% chance of being protected,"" Bourla said during an International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations meeting Tuesday. The document goes on to detail the safety profile of the vaccine as ""favorable"" and notes that the most common adverse reactions to the vaccine have been reactions at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. The document will be discussed in a meeting on Thursday, during which the FDA's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will provide recommendations to the FDA on whether the vaccine is effective in preventing Covid-19 in people 16 and older and whether the potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. Other vaccine candidates - those from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson - are set to complete Phase 3 trials in January and possibly be ready for use in February, Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser of the federal government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine initiative, said Tuesday. AstraZeneca's vaccine candidate was found to have an average 70.4% efficacy, according to an interim analysis of Phase 3 trial results published in The Lancet journal on Tuesday. Those findings Recruiting to vaccinate over the holidays If the vaccines are approved in the US, officials hope to distribute the first wave this month, Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday: ""We will start to have shots in arms within 96 hours of EUA. That's what I believe with all my heart."" Mount Sinai Hospital System in New York has begun recruiting people to vaccinate its health care workers over the holiday season, Susan Mashni, vice president and chief pharmacy officer for Mount Sinai health system, told CNN. In addition to nurses, pharmacists and those who are currently administering flu vaccines, they are reaching out to pharmacy and nursing interns, as well as medical students and residents. The system is planning to administer Pfizer's vaccine in ""pods,"" using makeshift walls and bays in hospital lobbies, and to stagger the immunizations among employees in anticipation that they will feel side effects.","US has to overcome Covid-19 denial and pull together, Fauci says"
https://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/14/health/presidential-candidate-health-disclosure/index.html,"CNN On Monday, Donald Trump released With the release, Trump joins Excellent or not, what right does the public have to know the intimate details of a candidate's medical history? After all, they are shielded by the same federal privacy laws that protect each of us from undue scrutiny. ""It's a controversial issue because some illness can be blown out of proportion and with modern medicine a person can do well,"" said History shows that most presidential candidates have kept their medical information private. Only recently have candidates opted to release letters from personal physicians. Few go as far as Sen. John McCain, who released thousands of carefully selected medical records to the press for a few hours during his bid for the 2000 and ""It's a very touchy subject,"" said  ""The public has a right to know if the candidate has a reason to believe he might die in office. Short of that, I think the president has a right to keep his medical and mental health information private,"" said ""Why do some open up? I think the ones who talk believe they are better off with the information out there. They must think the speculation is worse than the reality."" Legacy of presidential coverups History reveals an astounding list of hidden truths when it comes to the health of the commander in chief. One of the most unusual was Grover Cleveland's 1893 coverup of his oral cancer surgery. He smuggled a surgeon and his team onto a friend's yacht to remove a tumor from the roof of his mouth. Cleveland emerged from his ""fishing trip"" a week later. No one knew what had happened for nearly a quarter-century.  Woodrow Wilson had suffered several strokes while he was serving as president of Princeton, years before he ran for president, said Post,  Decades later, ""the most important event was the death of Franklin Roosevelt, back in 1945,"" said Boston University's Annas. While the public knew Franklin Delano Roosevelt was wheelchair-bound due to polio when he ran for the fourth time, they did not know he had advanced heart disease and hypertension, which is believed to have contributed to the cerebral hemorrhage that killed him ""The idea of a president dying in office from a disease he knew he had before he ran for election or re-election doesn't sit quite right with most people,"" Annas said. The ability to lead Candidates have long been wary of allowing the public to see them as less than ""perfection,"" as Trump claimed his health would be. ""We want a leader who is all wise and all powerful and in excellent health,"" Post said.  ""If we thought the candidate was ill or failing it would affect his electability."" John F. Kennedy, at 43 the youngest man to become president, was viewed as healthy and vibrant during his campaign. In reality, he took office suffering from ""Addison's disease affects your cortisol levels, your ability to handle stress,"" said Dr. Connie Mariano, who served as White House physician for Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. ""You wonder, was the Bay of Pigs an issue because he wasn't adequately treated for Addison's?"" ""Addison's disease affects your cortisol levels, your ability to handle stress,"" said Mariano, the former White House physician. ""You wonder, was the Bay of Pigs an issue because he wasn't adequately treated for Addison's?"" ""There was also some question when George H. W. Bush was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, or grave's disease, around the time of the Gulf War,"" Mariano continued. ""Did that make Bush more hyper and aggressive? Did it affect his memory, or his ability to focus? Can you say Desert Storm was thyroid storm? It's hard to say."" Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's after his presidency. Whether it affected his ability to function while in office is a subject of debate. Today, however, medical science knows Alzheimer's begins in the brain 20 to 30 years before symptoms begin. ""Can you rely on the politician's physician to spot these types of issues? Some illnesses are only known by the symptoms the patient complains of,"" Post said. ""The softening of mental processes that begin in early Alzheimer's, for example, may only show up if the politician complains about it.""  Mariano adds that even when there are signs, ""you have to remember if there is something wrong with a president that kicks him out of office, everyone who comes with him leaves. So everyone wants to keep him in; they want to silence the doctor."" And then there's the specter of mental illness. Added Mariano, ""If you have a mental illness, you're depressed, you can't get out of bed, that's going to affect your ability to do your job."" A 2006 study by Duke psychiatrists applied today's diagnostic criteria to historical records of the first 37 presidents between 1776 and 1974 and found In fact, say the researchers, 10 of the 18 presidents exhibited enough symptoms of mental illness while in office to have affected their ability to lead the nation. Independent presidential health exam? In 2008, a high-profile panel of doctors recommended that presidential and vice-presidential candidates be required to undergo a health exam by an independent team of doctors from the American College of Physicians. Mariano was on that committee. ""So we said in a perfect world, wouldn't it be great if we had a committee that performed physicals and said this person is good to go, just like we do for airline pilots, or in the military,"" Mariano said. ""It would say, 'OK, I'm good for four to eight years, I hopefully won't die of some disease that I'm aware of, I'm mentally sane and I don't have any drug or alcohol or psychiatric issues and I want to run for office.'"" The recommendation didn't go anywhere. Mariano now thinks it's not practical in a polarized political world. ""Part of that is that you have to have compliance by the person who is running for office,"" Mariano said. ""A lot of them feel like that's an invasion of their privacy; they're not willing to share that. And part of it was they'll say 'Wait a minute, do the doctors reveal if they're Democrat or Republican? You know a Republican doctor can say that a Democratic candidate is crazy.'"" Mariano feels that the only good solution is a free and inquisitive press. ""The things that happened with Woodrow Wilson and his stroke, and FDR, and Kennedy - can you do that now? It's harder to hide things today because you have 24/7 news."" ""I remember with Bill Clinton: He'd be giving a statement in the Rose Garden and he'd point to a reporter and his hand would be trembling,"" Mariano said, reminiscing about her time as White House physician. ""And the next inquiry I had from a reporter was 'Oh my God, does he have Parkinson's disease?' No, but he does have a benign essential tremor."" Whether they have the right to privacy or not, Annas said, it can be taken away from them in the real world. ""The media can ask, or their fellow candidates can press them if they want to,"" Annas said. Which leaves us with the doctor's letters released by candidates as the only form of assurance about the health of presidential candidates. ""I'm sure the doctors are swayed by their prestigious patient, but I think the public knows that, too,"" Annas said. ""We take the results with a grain of salt, but it's better than nothing.""",Do voters have the right to know presidential candidates' health histories?

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/11/health/healthy-food-swaps-wellness/index.html,"CNN When I think of healthy food swaps, I'll be honest: Most of the time, I'm uninterested. I'm the type who would rather have a tiny portion of the real thing than a larger portion of a less satisfying diet substitute. But I must say, the landscape for healthful food swaps has changed over the years. There are some terrific ingredient swaps you can include in dips and baked goods; foods with more healthful nutrient profiles that don't sacrifice flavor; and delicious recipes you can make that are actually more filling than their traditional versions. When making a swap, taste and texture are key, according to Denver-based registered dietitian nutritionist Kelli McGrane, who said we've come a long way from replacing butter or oil with applesauce in cookies. ""People are playing around with different kinds of flour and using avocado in brownies -- and these foods offer the same mouthfeel, but they are healthier."" Healthful food swaps you will love Here are some tasty swaps that are not only lower in calories than their traditional cousins; they also offer a lot more nutrients that will satisfy your palate in addition to nourishing you so that you feel energized throughout the day. They are organized into three categories: food swaps, ingredient swaps and recipe swaps. Note: The nutritional data for swaps was provided by digital health and fitness platform Food Swaps   ""Chickpea and other legume-based pastas provide about five times more fiber and two times more protein than traditional pasta noodles,"" said McGrane, who is also a contributing dietitian for Lose it! Because chickpea pasta has more fiber and protein, ""it will be a more filling meal, but you'll still get that nice chew that you expect from your pasta dishes,"" McGrane said.    I enjoy a tasty compromise: I sprinkle granola on top of a lower-calorie, high fiber cereal, like All-Bran or whole grain flakes. It gives extra crunch with half of the added sugars in a bowl of granola.   Spiralized veggies like spiralized sweet potatoes and zucchini are a nutritious substitute for pasta and can be used in Italian meals like spaghetti and meatballs or Asian-flavored noodle dishes like pad thai. You can also roast a spaghetti squash, scoop out the flesh and sprinkle some Parmesan for a flavorful fiber-rich pasta substitute. It's so tasty, we do it on a regular basis in my house!   Riced cauliflower or broccoli can be used to make a more nutritious fried rice or stir-fry since it's made entirely from vegetables. And this swap is especially helpful for those who need to limit calories and carbs. For example, a cup of white rice has 205 calories and 45 grams of carbs, while a cup of cauliflower rice has only 25 calories and 5 grams of carbs.   Veggie sticks or straws may appear like a healthful addition, but they're not that different from potato chips. ""The main ingredients in these products are usually potato flour and cornstarch, with the veggie part coming from vegetable powders,"" McGrane said. Instead, opt for raw veggies, like carrots, bell peppers, cucumber or celery for a true boost of vitamins and fiber, and pair with hummus or a low-fat dip.   Use avocado instead of butter and heavy cream for a decadent and healthful treat. ""Avocado truffles are just as luscious and satisfying, yet slightly lower in fat and calories than dark chocolate truffles,"" McGrane said. Plus, as avocados are a good source of several micronutrients, including potassium, vitamin K, and folate, you get an extra nutrition boost compared to using butter. My   Toasted cinnamon raisin bread spread with whipped cream cheese has all the flavors of a cinnamon roll, but is lower in calories, sugar and saturated fat. ""These differences are even greater if you're buying a bakery-style cinnamon roll,"" McGrane said. A mini Cinnabon, for example, has 350 calories, 23 grams of sugar and 7 grams of saturated fat, while a slice of cinnamon raisin bread with one tablespoon of whipped cream cheese has only 115 calories, 6 1/2 grams of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. Ingredient and condiment swaps   ""I love chia seed jam as it's made with just three whole ingredients -- chia seeds, strawberries and maple syrup -- and it has half the amount of sugar as traditional store-bought jams,"" said McGrane, who frequently makes this Thanks to the gelling properties of chia seeds, ""you don't even need pectin to make this fruity treat.""  Pectin is a thickening agent used in foods.   Pureed silken tofu makes a great swap for heavy cream in decadent desserts, as it provides a smooth and creamy base and adds healthy plant-based protein to desserts like mousse or tarts, according to McGrane. Add 1 cup of pureed tofu in place of 1 cup of heavy cream, and save over 600 calories and over 50 grams of saturated fat per cup.   These two ingredients are similar in texture, but Greek yogurt offers about three times the amount of protein and is much lower in saturated fat. Choose whole milk Greek yogurt, which will offer a creamier texture than low-fat yogurt.   Using unsweetened applesauce instead of oil in baking can be an easy way to make your baked goods healthier. ""Not only does using applesauce help cut back on calories and fat, but as it contains natural sugars, you may even be able to cut back on the amount of added sugar in your recipe,"" McGrane said. Plus it still keeps baked goods moist. ""For the swap, you can use 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce for every 1 cup of oil called for in the recipe. However, for best texture, I like to replace just half of the oil with applesauce. I find this swap works best for muffins, quick breads and denser cakes, like carrot cake."" Pureed or canned pumpkin is another good oil substitute, especially for quick breads, muffins and brownies. ""Not only is it also much lower in calories and saturated fat, but it also adds a healthy dose of fiber, vitamins A and C, and iron, McGrane said. For this swap use 3/4 cup of pureed pumpkin for every 1 cup of oil called for in the recipe.   Whether it's for topping your morning cereal or oatmeal, mixing into applesauce or sprinkling over baked goods, try using cinnamon over sugar. One teaspoon of sugar has 16 calories, whereas 1 teaspoon of cinnamon has only 6 calories.   ""Not only is mustard lower in calories and fat, but it can also add a great punch of flavor to tuna or potato salads,"" McGrane said. Recipe swaps   Store-bought ice cream may be delicious, but it's typically high in calories, sugars and saturated fat. The next time you have ripened bananas, remove the peel and store them in a freezer bag. ""You'll be just minutes away from making a creamy frozen treat that's rich in potassium and lower in fat, sugar and calories,"" McGrane said. To make ""nice cream,"" simply place frozen banana slices, unsweetened almond milk, cocoa powder, a little maple syrup and a splash of vanilla extract in a blender. Blend until smooth, then dig in!   Cutting back on meat doesn't have to mean replacing meat entirely in a recipe. ""Even if you add a little bit of chopped mushroom to a ground beef patty mixture, that can help to reduce the meat you consume,"" said   Making your own air-popped popcorn is a To give air-popped popcorn a sweet and savory boost that will also upgrade its nutritional profile,   While store-bought burritos are convenient, they can be high in sodium. Instead try ""The great part about making your own is you can use up any leftover veggies you have sitting in the fridge,"" McGrane added.   Instead of store-bought frozen waffles, try making from whole wheat or oat flour. Simply whisk together eggs, milk, butter, honey, cinnamon and baking soda; then add flour, baking powder and salt. Ladle batter onto a hot waffle iron and cook until done. ""This easy swap is higher in fiber and protein, made with all-natural ingredients and tastes better, too!"" McGrane said. For convenience, you can make a big batch during the weekend, then freeze any leftovers. To keep waffles crispy, reheat them in a toaster rather than a microwave. And for added flavor and antioxidants, add berries to your waffle batter.","Brownies, truffles and pasta: Healthful food swaps you will love"

During the coronavirus pandemic, the dispersion of cough droplets has become of great interest among scientists. The new study, published on Tuesday in ""Young children may be at greater risk compared to adults based on the typical downward cough trajectory. Teenagers and short adults are advised to maintain a social distance greater than 2 m from taller persons,"" the researcher wrote in the study. ""Surgical masks are known to be effective at trapping large droplets and therefore recommended for use as necessary."" The researchers - from Singapore's The researchers ran the simulation with different droplet sizes, air temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed and varying distances between the cougher and the listener. The study suggests that at wind speeds of 2 meters per second - or about 4 miles per hour - the travel distances for droplets around the sizes of 100 micrometers and 1,000 micrometers can reach 21.6 feet and 4 feet, respectively, at 86 degrees Fahrenheit. For a 100-micrometer droplet, the researchers found that the travel distance increases from about 3 feet without wind to about 22 feet at a wind speed of about 6.7 miles per hour. The study has some limitations, including that the results are based on simulation models - not real-life experiments - and the effects of ambient temperature and humidity on the viability of the coronavirus remains unclear. This isn't the first time a model has suggested that a cough can travel farther than six feet. In May,","Cough droplets can travel beyond six feet, new simulation study suggests"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/01/health/kids-middle-school-social-dynamics-wellness/index.html,"CNN During school shutdowns, educators did their best to re-create in-class learning online. But what about the kind of learning that happens in the hallways in-between classes, or on the playground during lunch and after school? Those in-person social interactions, the sort that emotionally challenge, enlighten and torment our children, were not transferable to video conference calls. Now the kids are back, in the presence of the peers they click with, peers they forgot about, and peers they weren't particularly looking forward to seeing again. Late-childhood friendships are hard enough as it is, as the business of figuring out who we are in the context of others makes for a rather messy process. Add a year or more away from a physical campus, and social connection can be even trickier. CNN spoke to Judith Warner, the author of ""    Kids who are struggling to socialize or reacclimate may be experiencing sensory overload and are exhausted. On one hand, socialization is hardwired. But on the other hand, if you don't socialize then the wiring doesn't develop at the same speed. Social skills, like academic skills, get stronger through practice. After a year and half off, it makes sense that kids' social skills are rusty. Mine are rusty, too.     It's kind of like a sick cosmic joke. You are suddenly more aware of how others see you right around the time that meanness and bullying spike. But there is a good side to it, too. At this age, kids can have wonderful friendships, filled with joy, and   It's also important to make sure kids know they have someone to go to and talk about hard social situations. It might be a parent, or someone at school like a teacher or a counselor who they trust and feel close to and who will give them objective feedback. When your kids are home, sitting around the kitchen bashing someone, ask questions. Don't just agree that so-and-so sounds like a b*tch, tempting as it may sometimes be. And don't just tell them gossip is horrible, which inevitably fails. Instead, try to get actual information about why they are talking about this person that way. Try to steer them in the direction of seeing things from this other kid's point of view. Help them see him or her as a real person, because it is hard to fully write someone off when they become a real person with complicated feelings and contradictory emotions just like them. This doesn't mean they have to like everyone, but they should be developing the sense that we should seek to protect the feelings of other human beings. Anything you can do to lead them in the direction of basic kindness does a favor to both kids. Research shows that being competitive doesn't make people happy, while   Some of that might have to do with the way our school systems separate them out. Kids can do better in K-8 schools, staying in that homey atmosphere of elementary school instead of starting something new during this vulnerable time. When kids feel vulnerable or weak, that makes them more likely to be mean. Some districts are already moving to this (school structure). Also, the competitive nature of American life, which adults often transmit to their kids, isn't helping. It erodes our sense of community, solidarity and kindness because, as psychologist Suniya Luthar explained to me, if everyone is competing for the brass ring, then everyone else is, by definition, their competitor. That does not create a happy or friendly world.   It's as though presenting a perfect face, physically and verbally, has gone the way of dyeing gray hair. It would be fantastic if a similar sort of solidarity, based on an acknowledgment of our collective vulnerability, was built up among kids - and even better if it sticks around while life returns to something like normal.",How to help your kids readjust to social dynamics at school
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/22/world/wuhan-coronavirus-visual-guide-intl/index.html,"An outbreak of new coronavirus has sickened about 1,400 people worldwide and killed at least 41 in mainland China, while spreading to countries around the world. Its emergence has fueled fears of a deadly epidemic as hundreds of millions of people travel in China, or around the Asian region, during the Lunar New Year holiday. What is the virus? Coronavirus is a large family of viruses, which include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Common symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, and possibly a headache. Those who have a weakened immune system, particularly the young and the elderly, are at risk of the virus turning into a more serious respiratory tract illness. Authorities said the Wuhan coronavirus was passed from animals to humans; can be spread from person to person; and appears to cause pneumonia in people who have weakened immune systems. It is thought to be milder that SARS and MERS and take longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, causing them to visit a hospital. Experts are now trying to understand how it is being transmitted, who is at most risk and whether transmission is occurring mostly in hospitals or in the community. In one instance, 14 doctors and nurses operating on a patient - who was not known to be carrying the virus - were all infected with it, suggesting it can be spread relatively easily. Where is this happening?  The outbreak emerged last month in the largest city in central China, Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in Hubei province. Officials linked it to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, saying wild animals sold there are the likely source of the virus. The market has been closed since January 1 for disinfection and officials are scrambling to discover its animal source. Snakes - the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra - may be responsible for transmitting coronavirus to humans. Scientists in China say that the virus might have jumped from bats to snakes, which were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, and then to humans. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery, and further tests are necessary to determine the source animal. At least 30 people died in the province, many of them elderly and suffering from pre-existing conditions. As deaths mount in the city, officials imposed a number of new measures including the postponement of New Year celebrations in Wuhan, a ban on tour agencies from bringing groups of people out of the city and thermal monitors and screening in public spaces.  From the first reported case in December, in Hubei province, the virus has spread to The country has adopted prevention and control measures that are typically used for major outbreaks such as plague and cholera. This means health officials will get sweeping powers to lock down affected areas and quarantine patients. Wuhan ""temporarily"" closed its airport and railway stations on Thursday for departing passengers, and all public transport services are suspended until further notice. The city's coronavirus task force also announced the closure of highways out of the city. Meanwhile, the city made it mandatory for everyone to wear face masks in public places after confirmed coronavirus cases passed the 500 mark.  Authorities in China have imposed indefinite travel restrictions in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is under effective lockdown, with all public transport in and out of the city closed. Other cities across the province are under less severe travel restrictions.  The virus has spread well beyond mainland China, so far to 13 places including Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Airports around the world have increased health screenings and implemented new quarantine procedures as officials race to slow the spread of the virus. Various countries,  Wuhan is a major transportation hub. Not only is the city a center for China's high-speed rail network, it has flights going to more than 60 international destinations from Tianhe International Airport. On Thursday, as confirmed cases ramped up across the country, government officials announced the temporary closure of Wuhan's airport and railway stations. All train tickets in and out of Wuhan have also been suspended, while multiple international airlines have canceled flights to the city. China has encouraged passengers traveling to and from Wuhan to change their How does this compare to the SARS virus? Scientists say the infectiousness of the virus is not as strong as SARS, but have added that the number of people infected is climbing. A study by researchers in the UK estimated that the number of infections in Wuhan is still grossly underestimated, with the real number closer to 4,000 as of January 18, based on the spread of the virus to other cities and countries in a relatively short period of time. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in a pandemic that ripped through Asia in 2002 and 2003. On Thursday, David Heymann, the chairman of a World Health Organization committee gathering data on the outbreak, said the virus spreads more easily from person to person than previously thought. But there is still much that is not known about the virus and, as the above graphic shows, its death rate is far smaller than that seen during the SARS outbreak.",A visual guide to the Wuhan coronavirus
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/03/health/covid-test-negative-contagious-wellness/index.html,"CNN If you think a negative test result means you don't have coronavirus, you could be wrong. It can take days before a new infection shows up on a Covid-19 test. ""We know that the incubation period for Covid-19 is up to 14 days. And before that, you can be testing negative, and have no symptoms,"" emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said. So if you want to get tested before seeing friends or family, here's what you need to know: If I got infected yesterday, would a test today pick that up? Probably not. A study in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine examined The study estimated that during four days of infection On the day people started showing symptoms, the average false-negative rate had dropped to 38%, according to the study. Three days after symptoms started, the false-negative rate dropped to 20%. ""The virus just takes time to replicate in the body to detectable levels,"" said Justin Lessler, a senior author of the study and associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""You can get infected by just a few viral particles, but these will not be detectable until they have time to replicate to adequate levels to be detected,"" he told CNN by email. So how many days should a person wait after possible exposure to get tested? ""There is no hard and fast rule, but the evidence suggests getting a test before the third day after exposure is not of much use,"" Lessler said. Could I be contagious while testing negative? Absolutely. ""People sort of feel like if you test (negative), you're out of the woods. And you're kind of not,"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of the infectious diseases division at Massachusetts General Hospital. For people who get sick with Covid-19, symptoms can take up to two weeks to appear, but the average time is about five days, Walensky said. ""It's generally thought that you're most infectious the two days before that day and the two days after that,"" she said. One reason why this virus spreads so easily is because people can be infectious without any symptoms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 40% of infections are asymptomatic, and 50% of transmissions happen before symptoms begin. ""It's been among the biggest Achilles' heels of this. And it's been among the biggest challenges and the unexpected things because (with) its cousins, this is not true,"" Walensky said. ""The reason we were able to control the SARS outbreak so quickly - although there were obviously a lot of deaths there - but it didn't turn into a pandemic is because people weren't shedding (the virus) until they got symptoms."" Do different Covid-19 tests matter? There are two main types of diagnostic tests that try to detect whether you have an active coronavirus infection:  ""This test is typically highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated,"" the FDA says. But the downside to molecular testing is that results can take a while - anywhere from the same day to one week after testing. ""For people who show symptoms, so far the studies show the accuracy of the molecular test to find a positive case increases with each day after the exposure,"" said But for infected people who don't get symptoms, the accuracy rates are less clear, she said. ""Molecular test performance studies on asymptomatic people are very limited.""  Antigen tests don't look for the virus' genetic material, like molecular tests do. Instead, they look for specific proteins on the surface of the virus. The good news is you can get antigen test results in less than an hour. The bad news is you're more likely to get a false negative with a rapid antigen test. ""Positive results are usually highly accurate but negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test,"" the FDA says. ""Antigen tests are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection compared to molecular tests."" This could help explain some of the recent spread of Covid-19 linked to the White House. While staff members close to Regardless of which type of diagnostic test you use, you're generally more likely to get a false negative than a false positive. ""If a molecular test is positive, it's an accurate reflection of a person being infected,"" MacDonald said. Can I test myself at home? Yes. There are some at-home testing kits available, such at the But taking any kind of Covid-19 test too early might miss an infection, said Dr. Frank Ong, chief medical and scientific officer at Everlywell. ""As testing capacity has continued to increase, more and more asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals have undergone testing, most of whom likely have lower viral loads in their clinical samples,"" he said. ""My best advice is to treat yourself as if you are likely infected after suspected exposure. Quarantine, wear a mask to cover both nose and mouth, and practice good hygiene practices. If you want to take extra precautions or you believe you may have been exposed, get tested for the virus using an FDA-authorized test for Covid-19."" So what should I do if I want to see friends or relatives? If you insist on seeing anyone who doesn't live with you, self-quarantining for 14 days beforehand is best, Walensky said. ""If you do that properly, you don't need a test,"" she said. ""That's probably the cleanest way to do it."" To be clear: Quarantining means staying home. It does not mean you can run errands. ""'Grocery store' and 'quarantine' don't belong in the same sentence,"" Walensky said. Lessler agreed that quarantining is best, and any testing must be done intelligently. Lessler agreed that quarantining is best, and testing must be done intelligently. ""If you are visiting an elderly family member and have a reasonable risk of having been exposed, there is no substitute for 14 days of quarantine,"" Lessler said. ""At the very least I would wait 10 days (of quarantining) and have a negative test,"" he said. There have already been cases of coronavirus spread within families just days after a person tested negative, said Dr. Michael St. Louis, a member of the CDC's Community Guidance Team. He said everyone must remember to treat family from different households the same way you would treat unrelated friends or work colleagues during this pandemic. The best way to help make sure everyone stays healthy is to celebrate the holidays remotely. ""I have three kids. ... And my parents are not going to be joining us this year,"" Walensky said. ""It's just awful. But what I really hold out for is that my parents are pretty healthy, and I would never forgive myself if I put them in harm's way. And I'm just looking forward to a 2021 when we can be together."" The CDC suggests celebrating with loved ones virtually online. You can also make traditional Thanksgiving dishes and deliver them "" Walensky said the small sacrifices made this Thanksgiving will help ensure everyone will be healthy enough to sit at the table next year. ""At least they'll be there next year, whereas irresponsible behavior now might mean they won't be here later,"" she said. ""Let's do this so that we can have a much better shot of being around the table together, healthy, in 2021.""",Don't get a false sense of security with Covid-19 testing.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/09/health/psychiatric-diagnosis-covid19-risk-factor-wellness/index.html,"CNN People who have had Covid-19 may have an increased risk of being diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder such as anxiety or depression, according to a new study. Researchers looked at the medical records of 69 million people in the United States between January 20 and August 1. The data included 62,000 people who contracted Covid-19, as part of what the authors described as the largest study so far on links between coronavirus and mental health challenges. In the three months following testing positive for Covid-19, almost one in five survivors (18%) were found to get a psychiatric diagnosis. This is about twice as likely as for other groups of patients with different illnesses and conditions analyzed as part of the study over the same period. The researchers from the University of Oxford compared psychiatric diagnoses in Covid-19 survivors with patients who had influenza, other respiratory tract infections, skin infections, large bone fractures, gallstones and kidney stones. ""The study reports that patients have a somewhat higher risk of being diagnosed with a psychiatric illness, mainly anxiety or depression, after a COVID-19 diagnosis than after certain other medical events,"" said David Curtis, retired consultant psychiatrist and honorary professor at University College London and Queen Mary University of London, in a statement. ""For example, they show that there is an 18% chance of getting a psychiatric diagnosis after Covid-19 compared with 13% after influenza,""  Curtis, who wasn't involved in the research, told the Science Media Centre in London. ""It's difficult to judge the importance of these findings. These psychiatric diagnoses get made quite commonly when people present to doctors, and it may be unsurprising that this happens a bit more often in people with Covid-19, who may understandably have been worried that they might become seriously unwell and who will also have had to endure a period of isolation."" The study, which published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry It could be explained by several factors including a direct neurological or biological effect of the virus, the drugs used to treat it, the worry and anxiety caused by contracting the disease and wider concerns about the pandemic, said study author Paul Harrison, a  professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford and Warneford Hospital. It's also possible that the data in the electronic medical records collated by the TriNetX Analytics Network didn't adequately capture socioeconomic or behavioral factors that might explain the link. ""We need to be cautious in our interpretation and unpick this important question,"" Harrison said in a news briefing. Need for long-term data In the period between 14 and 90 days after a Covid-19 diagnosis, 5.8% of survivors in the study had their first recorded diagnosis of psychiatric illness compared with 2.5% to 3.4% of patients in the comparison groups. Thus, adults have an approximately doubled risk of being newly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder after a Covid-19 diagnosis, the study said. Having a psychiatric disorder in the previous year was linked with an increased chance of getting Covid-19, the study also found. This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for Covid-19, such as obesity, but could be explained by possible socioeconomic factors. The researchers did not include mental health symptoms that appeared during the first two weeks such as delirium or other transient cognitive impairments. Other studies have found that delirium and agitation may  be Medical experts said that  the study had limitations. In particular, the follow-up period was only 90 days. ""Does distress persist when there is no life threatening infectious disease proliferating? This study does not offer long-term data - this should be at the forefront of our minds when interpreting the findings - it cannot predict psychiatric outcomes at one year follow up and does not account for worrying post-covid physical symptoms that may be distressing,"" Jo Daniels, a senior lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, told the SMC. The study, Daniels said, didn't note what proportion of Covid survivors in the study had ongoing long Covid symptoms, which are known to be associated with disabling and distressing symptoms. Dame Til Wykes, the vice dean of psychology and systems sciences at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, said we needed to develop as many different, accessible forms of mental health support as possible. ""We know from previous pandemics that mental health difficulties usually follow in survivors, and this study shows the same pattern after Covid-19, so it is not unexpected.

Some hospitals are running out of room in the ICU In states across the nation, officials remain concerned about the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital and the ability of hospitals to find enough rooms. California on Wednesday set records in cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions. The most populous state has only about 1,500 ICU beds available. Fresno County's Interim Public Health Officer Dr. Rais Vohra reported zero ICU capacity Tuesday. ""Whenever the ICUs get full, it's really hard to move patients through the emergency department. It's really hard for us to provide efficient services,"" said Vohra, a specialist in emergency medicine. The state has mandated restrictions for five regions if ICU capacity goes below 15%. The greater Sacramento region reached the threshold Wednesday and a stay-at-home order for 3 million residents will begin late Thursday. ""I know that those who aren't in the medical field may not understand or quite grasp just how dire the situation is, but all the things you're hearing about - how impacted our hospitals are, about how dire the situation with our ICUs is - it's absolutely true.

The new precautionary advice on allergies was given after two health care workers ""responded adversely"" following their shots Tuesday, National Health Service England said Wednesday. The two recipients had an unspecified history of allergic reactions, and both carried adrenaline autoinjectors. Both are recovering, officials said. But because of the two incidents, ""any person with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food (such as previous history of anaphylactoid reaction or those who have been advised to carry an adrenaline autoinjector) should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,"" the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said in new advice Wednesday, according to PA Media. The MHRA said it will issue updated advice once it reviews the two cases. Pfizer issued a statement saying it was supporting the investigation. Azar, the US health and human services secretary, said he wants to make sure the FDA examined the UK allergic reaction data when it discusses the Pfizer vaccine Thursday. ""FDA is not going to cut any corners,"" Azar told CNN Wednesday. People with a history of severe reactions to vaccines were not included in its vaccine trial, according to Pfizer data released by the FDA on Tuesday. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN that roughly one of every 1.4 million vaccine doses in the US is complicated by a severe allergic reaction. In the case of the Pfizer vaccine, he said it will be important for UK officials to find out exactly what component of the vaccine caused the reactions in the two patients, so that the country could offer tailored guidance rather than a ""blanket recommendation.""

Scientists sequence the genome - the entire genetic map of the virus - to find mutations that could affect how the virus spreads. British scientists found a new variant of the virus was spreading there and say the pattern of mutations makes it more easily transmitted, although it does not appear to cause more severe disease. It's now been found in at least 37 countries, including in the US, where cases have been identified in California, Colorado and Florida. ""It's important that we monitor the virus and that we be able to pick up these trends that have implications for public health and clinical medicine,"" Armstrong told CNN. To ramp up the sequencing, the CDC gave about $15 million to state health labs in December. In September and December CDC granted about $8 million to seven university labs and expects to give money to more university labs in the next few months, Armstrong said. He added that the agency has also made contracts with Illumina and Labcorp, two private labs, to do genomic sequencing. The US has been criticized for not sequencing enough virus samples. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the US has submitted about 57,000 genomic sequences to GISAID, a centralized database used by countries around the world. In comparison, the UK has had far fewer infections but has submitted about 141,000 sequences. Armstrong noted that the UK and some other countries have a more centralized system for doing sequencing, while in the US several different types of labs - federal, state, academic, and private - are doing the work. ""It's a somewhat patchy system,"" Armstrong said. A World Health Organization official said results are expected this week from labs that are studying whether the new variant first identified in Britain might pose a challenge to coronavirus vaccines. Scientists in the UK and elsewhere have taken blood from people who have been vaccinated and are testing it in the lab to see if the antibodies created by the vaccine protect against the new variant, according to Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response. They're also taking blood from people who have been infected with the new variant and testing it in the lab to see how well the vaccine works against it, she told CNN. Pfizer and Moderna, the makers of the two vaccines authorized in the US, are working in their labs to see if the vaccine is effective against different variants of the virus. On Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,  said the immune response from the vaccines was ""very likely"" to protect against the new variant. The UK variant has 17 mutations, an unusually high number. Scientists are also doing tests to assess the vaccine's efficacy against a variant found in South Africa that has 22 mutations, Van Kerkhove said.",CDC hopes to double the number of coronavirus samples checked for new mutations

The group urged pharmaceutical companies to share their technology and intellectual property with the World Health Organization, and called on governments to commit to sending vaccines to the developing world, in order to close the economic disparity between nations as they look to emerge from the devastating Covid-19 crisis.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/30/health/covid-19-vaccine-fda-independent-commission/index.html,"CNN Citing criticism of government agencies and increasing public distrust of vaccines, several prominent physicians and experts are calling for the creation of an independent commission to review data from coronavirus vaccine trials before a vaccine is allowed on the market. The US Food and Drug Administration regulates vaccines, and its OK is all that's needed to put one on the market. The physicians fear, however, that after several government blunders during the pandemic, a layer of review independent from the government is needed to give Americans confidence that the shot is safe and effective. A CNN poll this month shows that 40% of Americans do not want to get a coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available, even if it's free and easy to access. Such a low uptake of the vaccine Dr. Kathryn Stephenson, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said she thought of the idea of an independent panel to increase trust in the vaccine after several colleagues told her they did not want to get a coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available. ""I'm hearing this from my peers, from doctors and nurses. They're not anti-vaxxers. They're pro vaccine. They vaccinated their own children. But they are skeptical about this vaccine,"" said Stephenson, director of the clinical trials unit at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Separately from Stephenson, bioethicist Arthur Caplan arrived at the same conclusion. ""We're used to this world where if the FDA or the CDC or the NAS says something is safe and effective, that's enough, but I don't think this time that's sufficient to overturn public skepticism,"" said Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Health, referring to the US Centers for Disease Control and the National Academy of Sciences. ""I think we desperately need an independent national commission."" Assurances from the FDA Stephanie Caccomo, an FDA spokeswoman pointed CNN to an August 18 blog in ""First, the agency established Hahn has repeatedly made such assurances to the public. ""I can promise you that when the data are available, FDA will review them, using its established rigorous and deliberative scientific process,"" Hahn told Dr. Susan Bailey, the president of the American Medical Association, at a videobriefing earlier this month. ""We all understand that only by engaging in an open review process and relying on good science and sound data, can the public, and you as providers, have confidence in the integrity of our decisions."" Hahn added that clinical trial data will be reviewed by More than half the members of the panel are academic experts who are employed by universities and research centers. To some experts, Hahn's words about the advisory committee are at least somewhat reassuring and negate the need to create another panel. ""An independent commission already exists. We're not FDA employees,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who is a member of the FDA advisory committee. ""We don't need another level of bureaucracy."" But Caplan, the NYU ethicist, said he worries that many Americans don't trust experts anymore, no matter how reputable they might be. ""We're going to have to get past this relying on expert endorsement. It's an old school way of thinking from pre-Covid days,"" he said. 'Sounds like a hot mess' Stephenson, Caplan, and others say while they respect the scientific and ethical rigor of researchers such as Offit, they think many Americans will be skeptical of the findings of an FDA committee, especially since some of its members work for pharmaceutical companies and government agencies, according to the roster currently on the FDA website. ""The whole topic of COVID vaccines is *already* politicized and many people's skepticism is fairly entrenched at this point,"" Multiple factors have intensified the public's skepticism about the vaccine, the doctors told CNN. First, the name of the government's vaccine program - ""Operation Warp Speed"" - can give the impression that the research is being hurried, and therefore could yield an unsafe vaccine. Two, other government efforts have struggled since the beginning of the pandemic. The CDC was late getting Covid-19 diagnostic tests on the market, for example, and the FDA The FDA issued an emergency authorization for the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, only to revoke that authorization less than two months later. More recently, the agency authorized the use of convalescent plasma, even though many experts think there's not enough data to show it works. ""Given the premature authorization of hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma, the FDA is perceived by many as tainted,"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. Three, statements by government officials have not engendered confidence. Earlier this month, Hahn made a statistical error that dramatically overestimated the effectiveness of convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19, apologizing for the mistake the next day. A few days later, US Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Dr. Brett Giroir said the White House Coronavirus Task Force had discussed and approved a widely criticized decision to change CDC Covid-19 testing guidelines. Later that day, task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said he was undergoing surgery at the time of discussions at the White House about the guideline changes. Then Sunday, ""I'm afraid that for the public this sounds like a hot mess, and that's going to carry forward to the vaccines as well,"" Stephenson said. ""I believe in the power of vaccines and I'm optimistic that we will get a safe and effective vaccine. I still want to fight for that and I want the public to come with us on this journey,"" Stephenson. ""And having an apolitical and independent group could reassure the public during a very partisan time."" Looking to the UK as an example The possibility that the entire vaccine approval system will be upended with an extra layer of review is unlikely. But that hasn't stopped doctors from advocating for it. Dr. Joseph Tucker, an infectious disease specialist at the University of North Carolina, saw Stephenson's August 22 tweet and reached out to her suggesting that they look at an independent panel in the UK that makes recommendations to the government on Covid-19, called He said he already knows he would want a US independent panel to look different. The British committee is made up of experts, but Tucker envisions having coronavirus survivors, as well as trusted community and religious leaders on any US panel, as well as vaccine experts. ""I want to have a body that's really trusted. What if members were like, say, Oprah? People who are reasonable and have large followings in the US and are not political and are widely recognized as thoughtful,"" Tucker said. Walensky, the infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, likes the idea, and thinks back to the early days of the HIV epidemic, when gay men protested to take part in policy decisions. ""When they were doing die-ins in front of the NIH, Dr. Fauci said 'Let them in, I want to hear what they have to say,'"" said Walensky, referring to the top infectious disease doctor at the National Institutes of Health. ""They had a voice at the table."" Something similar could be done for Covid-19 decisions, including the reviews of coronavirus vaccines, she said. ""The panel would have the community's best interest at heart,"" she said. ""It's not the scientists speaking to the community, but the community speaking to the community.""",Experts call for independent commission separate from FDA to review Covid-19 vaccines

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/11/health/nursing-home-covid-19-testing-khn-partner/index.html,"KHN Nursing homes are still taking days to get back Covid-19 test results as many shun the Trump administration's central strategy to limit the spread of the virus among old and sick Americans. In late summer, federal officials began distributing to nursing homes millions of point-of-care antigen tests, which can be given on-site and report the presence or absence of the virus within minutes. By January, the Department of Health and Human Services is slated to send roughly 23 million rapid tests. But as of Oct. 25, 38% of the nation's roughly 15,000 nursing homes have yet to use a point-of-care test, The numbers suggest a basic disagreement among the Trump administration, state health officials and nursing home administrators over the best way to test this population and how to strike the right balance between speed and accuracy. Many nursing homes still primarily send samples out to laboratories, using a type of test that's considered more reliable but can take days to deliver results. As a result, in 29% of the approximately 13,000 facilities that provided their testing speed to the government, results for residents took an average of three days or more, the analysis found. Just 17% of nursing homes reported their average turnaround time was less than a day, and the remainder tended to get results in one or two days. Wait times for test results of staff members were similar. Those lags could have devastating consequences, because even one undetected infection can quietly but rapidly trigger a broad outbreak. It's especially concerning as winter sets in and the pandemic notches daily records of infections. In the meantime, the coronavirus continues its march through institutions. Nursing homes have reported more than 262,000 infections and 59,000 deaths since the government began collecting the information in May. Even without estimating how many residents died from Covid-19 before then, reported nursing home deaths amount to more than a quarter of all Covid-19 fatalities in the U.S. so far. During the week ending Oct. 25, the most recent period for which data is available, a third of skilled nursing facilities reported a new suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection of a resident or staff member. Many state public health authorities and nursing homes have ongoing reservations about the rapid tests. They are considered less accurate than the more expensive ones sent out to laboratories, which are known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests and identify the virus's genetic material but often take days to complete. And their manufacturers say the rapid tests are designed for people with symptoms -- not for screening a general population. In early November, the Food and Drug Administration HHS bought millions of rapid tests to distribute to nursing homes as the federal government imposed new mandates for the facilities to test staffers at least once a month. Routine staff testing increases to as often as twice a week for homes in areas with the highest infection rates. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which is part of HHS, Leaders in multiple states, including Nevada, Vermont and Illinois, have moved to ban antigen tests in nursing homes or limit their use. ""I thought the hard part was getting the testing to the different facilities,"" said David Grabowski, a health care policy professor at Harvard Medical School. Instead, he said, ""The major barriers to the use of rapid testing seem to be a lack of guidance on when and how to use the tests, coupled with concerns about their accuracy."" Dr. Michael Wasserman, immediate past president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine, said the national effort has been chaotic and inadequate. The federal government ""just hands stuff off to nursing homes and then says, 'Hey, it's yours; go use it,'"" he said. ""And then when things fall apart, 'We're not to blame.'"" Nursing homes that don't trust the rapid tests are having to shoulder the higher cost of lab tests. It costs Stuart Almer, president and CEO of Gurwin Jewish Nursing & Rehabilitation Center on New York's Long Island, $125,000 a week to conduct lab tests on up to 1,500 residents and staff members. ""We embrace the testing,"" Almer said. ""But how are we supposed to continue operating and paying for this?"" Goodwin House in Virginia, which includes skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, had performed more than 9,500 tests for Covid-19 as of late October, said Joshua Bagley, an administrator. Only 100 of them were antigen tests. ""The majority of our focus is still toward the PCR testing,"" Bagley said. The concerns of state health officials were perhaps most evident in Nevada, where in early October the state banned antigen testing in nursing homes. HHS said the order was illegal, and it was revoked within days. ""There is no such thing as a perfect test,"" Adm. Brett Giroir, a senior HHS official who leads the Trump administration's Covid testing efforts, said on a call with reporters Nov. 9. For example, Giroir said, a risk of PCR tests is that they could provide a positive diagnosis when a person is no longer ""actually infectious."" Although there have been widespread accuracy concerns over antigen tests, certain tests the administration is distributing nationwide have comparable accuracy to lab-based tests, he said. Other state responses have not been as aggressive as Nevada's but nonetheless demonstrated unease over how best to use the devices, if at all. Vermont recommends the use of antigen tests after a known Covid exposure but says they should not be used to diagnose asymptomatic people. Ohio was initially reluctant to deploy them after Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's false positive result from an antigen device, although the tests have since been adopted, said Peter Van Runkle, executive director of the Ohio Health Care Association, which represents some  skilled nursing facilities in the state. Some nursing homes say relying on antigen tests has made a monumental difference. In Hutchinson, Kansas, Wesley Towers Retirement Community has used both types of tests, but it was Abbott's BinaxNOW antigen test that detected its first two asymptomatic people with Covid-19, said Gretchen Sapp, Wesley Towers' vice president of health services. ""We have more confidence that our staff are indeed Covid free or that they are out and not exposing residents. And that is incredibly helpful,"" Sapp said. ""The biggest challenge is I need more tests."" A total of 1,150 homes told the federal government they did not have enough supplies for point-of-care tests for all workers, the KHN analysis found. Nursing homes can go through millions of tests quickly when testing monthly or more often, depending on the level of Covid-19 in the area. White House spokesman Michael Bars said that the administration is working ""hand-in-hand with our state and local partners"" and ""doing more than ever to protect the health and safety of high-risk age groups most susceptible to the virus."" Janet Snipes, executive director of Holly Heights Care Center in Denver, said antigen tests have been useful to screen staff members despite a few false positive results. One test was used on a clergy member a resident had summoned. ""We wouldn't have been able to allow him in, but we were able to do the antigen testing,"" she said. ""With the vulnerable residents we serve, we're hoping for more antigen testing, more testing period, more testing of any type.""",Nursing homes still see dangerously long waits for Covid-19 test results

Ambulances roam the city, operated by emergency workers dressed in hazardous materials suits. Ghost town According to the Macao government, January tourism figures plunged 87% compared to the previous year, even though Hotels that were nearly at 100% capacity during the 2019 Lunar New Year were left half empty. The health scare has threatened the business model at the heart of Macao's economy. The unofficial gambling capital of the world depends on millions of visitors from mainland China. But now administrators are trying to ensure that the deadly new coronavirus first discovered last December in the In January, police went from hotel to hotel, rounding up hundreds of visitors from Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. Each person was given a choice: either go home or go into quarantine for two weeks. As of February 1, the dragnet had failed to track down more than 100 tourists from the region. ""We are still targeting different Hubei tourists,"" Chio Song Un, Macao's police commissioner, said at a press conference on Friday. At that briefing, 11 officials from the city government sat wearing masks, addressing a room full of journalists who had been instructed to also cover their faces. Ao Leong Lu, Macao's secretary for social affairs and culture, urged residents to avoid gathering in large numbers. Her administration also announced schools would be closed indefinitely. ""I never saw this in my life and I've been here since 1981,"" Albano Martins, an economist who worked in the city's administration when it was still a Portuguese colony, told CNN. He warned that Macao faces a major threat to its economy: ""If this effect still continue for two, three months more, we may have a two-digit contraction."" 'Trust in science' At Macao's main public hospital, hospital staff wait at the entrance dressed head-to-toe in plastic protective gear. The coronavirus isolation ward, located on the top floor, has a ventilation system that pumps out and filters air from the patients' rooms. On Sunday, administrators announced the discovery of the city's eighth case of coronavirus. They say a 64-year-old woman who never traveled to Hubei province, but did reportedly purchase live poultry from a wet market in China's southern Guangdong province, was being treated for moderate symptoms the virus. Her husband, as well as a doctor and nurse who had been in contact with her, were all in protective isolation, Vitor Moutinho, a spokesperson with Macao's Health Bureau, told CNN. Meanwhile, the city government has also urged companies to provide housing for non-resident employees. With a population of 600,000 - microscopic by Chinese city standards - Macao doesn't only rely on tourists from mainland China, with a sizeable chunk of its workforce also crossing the border every day. City officials say a man and a woman in the neighboring Chinese city of Zhuhai have been diagnosed with coronavirus. Both worked in and around Macao's casinos. One casino workers' union is calling for Macao to close its casinos and hotels, echoing similar calls in nearby Hong Kong. That city has already cut border crossings by 80% and instituted new traveler checks. Cloee Chao, president of New Macao Gaming Staff Rights, estimates the number of casino customers has plunged to less than 10% of normal activity - meaning a full closure would not have a significantly worse effect on the economy. ""Shutting down the casinos is the best way to protect the staff,"" she said. Despite the concern, the government has so far drawn a line against closing Macao's glittering gambling houses. However, asked whether this could be considered in future, Macao's Secretary for Economy and Finance told CNN he was not ruling it out.

She is one of thousands of certified nursing assistants who perform the intimate and physical work of bathing, dressing and feeding the nation's fragile elderly. ""We do everything for them. Everything you do for yourself, you have to do for the residents,"" Tapia said. And she's one of many in that low-paid field, In March, when the coronavirus began racing through nursing homes, the   ""When you learn that over 20 of your workers are also spending time in other nursing homes, that should be a real red flag,"" Chen said. The Toll on Patients and Beyond More than 84,000 residents and staff members of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have died of COVID-19 across the U.S., representing 40% of all coronavirus fatalities in the country, according to In California, the analogous toll is more than 5,700 deaths, making up 35% of all coronavirus fatalities in the state. The UCLA team created maps of movement and found that on average each nursing home is connected to seven others through staff movement. Limiting nursing home employees to one facility could mean fewer COVID-19 infections -- but that would hurt the workforce of people who say they work multiple jobs because of low wages. After each of her shifts, Tapia worries she'll bring the coronavirus home to her granddaughter. She tries to take precautions, including buying N95 masks from nurses. She knows it's not just patients who are at risk. Nursing home workers such as Tapia are also contracting COVID-19 -- in California alone, At the nursing home where she works in the morning, Tapia gets an N95 mask that she must only use -- and reuse -- in that facility. At her other nursing home job, in the afternoons, she gets a blue surgical mask to wear. ""They say they cannot give us N95 [masks],"" she said, because she works in the ""general area"" where residents haven't tested positive for the coronavirus. She doesn't want to work at multiple nursing homes, but her rent in Orange County is $2,200 a month, and her low pay and limited hours at each nursing home make multiple jobs a necessity. ""I don't want to get sick. But we need to work. We need to eat, we need to pay rent. That's just how it is,"" Tapia said. Staff Connections Equal Infections The UCLA study also found that some areas of the country have a much higher overlap in nursing home staffing than others. ""There are some facilities in Florida, in New Jersey, where they're sharing upwards of 50 to 100 workers,"" said UCLA associate professor They also found the more shared workers a nursing home has, the more COVID-19 infections among the residents. ""Not only does it matter how connected your nursing home is, but what really matters is how connected your connections are,"" Long said. The researchers say they've informally dubbed these highly connected nursing homes as each state's ""Kevin Bacon of nursing homes,"" after the ""We found that if you're going to see a nursing home outbreak anywhere, it's likely to spread to the Kevin Bacon of nursing homes in each state,"" Chen said. The team hopes that local health departments could use similar cellphone data methods as an early warning system. Using the test results from the ""Kevin Bacon of nursing homes"" as an indicator would be the first step. ""As soon as you detect an outbreak in one nursing home, you can immediately prioritize those other nursing homes that you know are at increased risk,"" Chen said. Prioritize Masks and Hand-Washing The California Association of Health Facilities represents most nursing homes in the Golden State. In response to the study, the group said its members can't prevent workers such as Tapia from taking jobs elsewhere, and they can't pay them more, because California doesn't pay them enough through Medicaid reimbursements.  ""We know from past experience that money tends to go into the pockets of the executives and administrators who run these places,"" Dark said. He agreed that ""Then you can wind up depriving some of the crucial health caregivers that we have in these facilities of their livelihoods, which can't be a good solution,"" he said. Instead, he said, regulators need to focus on the basics, especially in the 100 California nursing homes with ongoing outbreaks, since it's been shown that infection control measures work. ""Right now there's poor access to [personal protective equipment]. There's still erratic compliance with things like hand-washing requirements,"" he said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/08/health/seniors-vaccine-rollout-wellness-partner/index.html,"CNN Vaccines that protect against Covid-19 are on the way. What should older adults expect? The first candidates, from Pfizer and Moderna, could arrive before Christmas, according to Alex Azar, who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services. Both vaccines are notably effective in preventing illness due to the coronavirus, according to information released by the companies, although much of the data from clinical trials is still to come. Both have been tested in adults age 65 and older, who mounted a strong immune response. Seniors in nursing homes and assisted living centers will be among the first Americans vaccinated, following recommendations this week by a federal advisory panel. Older adults living at home will need to wait a while longer. Many uncertainties remain. Among them: What side effects can older adults anticipate and how often will these occur? Will the vaccines offer meaningful protection to seniors who are frail or have multiple chronic illnesses? Here's a look at what's known, what's not and what lies ahead. The decision-making timetable Pfizer's vaccine will be evaluated by a 15-member US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel Dec. 10. Moderna's vaccine is expected to go before the panel Dec. 17. At least two days before each meeting, an analysis by FDA staff will be made public. This will be the first opportunity to see extensive data about the vaccines' performance in large phase 3 clinical trials, including more details about their impact on older adults. So far, summary results disclosed in news releases indicate that Pfizer's vaccine, produced in partnership with BioNTech, has an overall efficacy rate of 95% and efficacy of 94% in people 65 and older. Moderna's overall efficacy is 94%, with 87% efficacy in preventing moderate disease in older adults, according to Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the US government's Covid-19 vaccine development program. If the advisory panel gives a green light, the FDA will decide within days or weeks whether to authorize the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for emergency use. Distribution of the vaccine has already begun, and health care providers are expected to begin administering it immediately after the FDA acts. Who gets the vaccine first At a Dec. 1 meeting of the Advisory Commission on Immunization Practices, which guides the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines, experts recommended that people living in long-term care (primarily nursing homes and assisted living facilities) and health care workers be the first groups to get Covid-19 vaccines. This recognizes the extraordinary burden of Covid-19 in long-term care facilities. Although their residents represent fewer than 1% of the U.S. population, they account for 40% of Covid deaths -- more than 100,000 deaths to date. The commission's decision comes despite a lack of evidence that Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are effective and safe for frail, vulnerable seniors in long-term care. Vaccines were not tested in this population. Federal officials insist side effects will be carefully monitored. Who gets vaccinated next? Next in line likely would be essential workers who cannot work from home, such as police, firefighters, teachers and people employed in food processing and transportation, according to commission deliberations Nov. 23 that have not come to a formal vote. Then would be adults with high-risk medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, obesity, heart disease and autoimmune diseases and all adults age 65 and older. Although states typically follow ACIP guidelines, some states may choose, for instance, to vaccinate high-risk older adults before some categories of essential workers. Left off the list are family caregivers, who provide essential support to vulnerable older adults living in the community -- an unpaid workforce of tens of millions of people. ""If someone is providing day-to-day care, it makes sense they should have access to the vaccine, too, to keep everyone safe,"" said Beth Kallmyer, vice president of care and support for the Alzheimer's Association. Lots of people are high priority Further prioritization. The priority groups constitute nearly half of the U.S. population -- 21 million health care workers, 3 million long-term care residents, 66 million essential workers, more than 100 million adults with high-risk conditions and 53 million adults age 65 and older. With initial supplies of vaccines limited, setting priorities will be inevitable. Practically, this means that hospitals and physicians may try to identify older adults who are at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid-19 and offer them vaccines before other seniors. A study of more than 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older provides new evidence that could influence these assessments. It found the conditions that most increase older adults' chances of dying from Covid-19 are sickle cell disease, chronic kidney disease, leukemias and lymphomas, heart failure, diabetes, cerebral palsy, obesity, lung cancer and heart attacks, in that order. ""Out of all Medicare beneficiaries, we identified just under 2,500 who had no medical problems and died of Covid-19,"" said Dr. Martin Makary, a co-author of the study and professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. ""We knew risk was skewed toward comorbidity (multiple underlying medical conditions), but we didn't realize it skewed this much."" How much is available Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, administered three to four weeks apart. The companies have said about 40 million doses of their vaccines should be available this year, enough to fully vaccinate about 20 million people. After that, 50 million doses might become available in January, followed by 60 million doses in both February and March, according to Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist who heads the Covid-19 Prevention Trials Network. That translates into enough vaccine for another 85 million people and should be sufficient to vaccinate older adults in addition to medical personnel on the front lines and many other at-risk individuals, Corey suggested at a recent panel on Covid-19 sponsored by the National Academy of Medicine and American Public Health Association. He acknowledged these were estimates, based on information he has been given. Pfizer and Moderna have not yet specified how much vaccine will be delivered and when. Nor is it clear when other vaccines under investigation will become available -- 13 are in phase 3 clinical trials -- or what their monthly production capacity might be. There may be distribution issues As Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are rolled out, a very vulnerable group may have difficulty getting them: 2 million seniors who are homebound and another 5.3 million with physical impairments who have problems getting around. The reason: handling and cold storage requirements. Pfizer's vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, calling for special equipment not available in small hospitals, clinics or doctors' offices. Moderna's vaccine needs long-term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius. Landmark Health provides in-home medical care to more than 120,000 frail, chronically ill homebound seniors in 15 states. ""We don't have the capabilities to store and distribute these vaccines to our population,"" said Dr. Michael Le, the company's co-founder and chief medical officer. Instead, he said, Landmark is working to arrange transportation for its patients to centers where Covid-19 vaccines will be administered and educating them about the benefits of the vaccines. ""Given the trust, the bond we have with our patients, we can play a big role as advocates,"" Le said. Another task is building trust Advocates have a big job ahead of them. According to a recent poll from the University of Michigan, only 58% of older adults (ages 50 to 80) said they were very or somewhat likely to get a Covid-19 vaccine. A significant number of older adults, 46%, thought they'd get the vaccine eventually but wanted others to go first. Only 20% wanted to get it as soon as possible. Most important in making decisions is knowing how well the vaccine works, according to 80% of the 1,556 older adults surveyed. Just over half (52%) said a recommendation from their doctor would be influential. Dr. Sharon Inouye, a geriatrician at Hebrew Senior Life in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, is among the physicians impatiently awaiting the publication of data from Pfizer's and Moderna's phase 3 clinical trials. Among the things she wants to know: How many older adults with chronic health conditions participated? How many participants were 75 and older? Did side effects differ for older adults? ""What I worry about most is the side effects,"" she said. ""We may not be able to know about serious but rare side effects until millions of people take them."" But that's a gamble she's willing to take. Not only will Inouye get a vaccine, she just told her 91-year-old mother, who lives in assisted living, to say ""yes"" when one is offered. ""My whole family lives in fear that something will happen to her every day,"" Inouye said. ""Even though there's a lot we still don't know about these vaccines, it's compelling that we protect people from this overwhelming illness.""",What seniors can expect when Covid-19 vaccines become available
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/18/health/dementia-heart-health-wellness/index.html,"CNN If you want to keep your brain sharp and focused as you age, it's important to keep your heart healthy. People with more risk factors for heart disease -- such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity -- experienced more cognitive decline than people with healthier hearts, according to a study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. ""There are many specific cardiovascular risk factors, and each can either individually, or in combination, push the fast-forward button towards different aspects of cognitive decline,"" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. ""This study focused on individual areas of cognition, such as memory and processing speed, and helps to clarify complex interrelationships between heart and brain health,"" said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study. The study followed over 1,500 dementia-free people with an average age of 79.5 for 21 years and found those at highest risk for poor heart health had faster declines in memory and the ability to compare letters, numbers, objects, pictures or patterns. Some of those people also underwent brain scans, which found shrinkage of the brain's memory center, the hippocampus, and an increase of white spots in the brain associated with declines in functionality. ""High blood pressure and diabetes can accelerate shrinkage of the brain. High cholesterol can increase the bad protein that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Decreased blood flow can cause 'white spots' on brain scans that can lead to slowed processing speed,"" said Isaacson, who is also a trustee of the McKnight Brain Research Foundation, which funds research to better understand and alleviate age-related cognitive decline. How to lessen your chances of dementia For those of us who want to improve our chances for a healthy brain in older age, ""making active lifestyle changes and seeing a doctor who can help control modifiable risk factors - such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and tobacco use,"" said Isaacson, ""is our best bet to maintain optimal brain function."" Here are some key ways to improve your heart health, and therefore your brain:      Dementia rates are skyrocketing Taking action to protect your brain is critical, experts say. The rate of Alzheimer's and dementia in the United States and around the world is skyrocketing. Nearly 6 million people suffer from Alzheimer's in the US, according to the Alzheimer's Association's 2020 report, and that is expected to grow to almost 14 million by the middle of the century. The World Health Organization says some 50 million people in the world have dementia, with the vast majority of those suffering from Alzheimer's. With nearly 10 million new cases worldwide every year, study authors say doctors need to have more tools, such as cardiovascular risk, to help them monitor and prevent cognitive decline. In a related editorial, Dr. Costantino Iadecola, who directs the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, agreed:  ""The results of this study suggest a useful tool for assessing dementia risk and support recommendations to aggressively manage cardiovascular risk factors in midlife.""","Age-proof your brain by keeping your heart healthy, study says"
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/15/health/life-skills-teaching-children-wellness/index.html,"CNN I taught my 12-year-old daughter to change a car battery at 8 p.m. in a grocery store parking lot. It's one of the many skills that I want her to know in case she ever finds herself stranded in a parking lot - just like her father at that very moment. I also wanted to get her familiar with a car engine, even though to me it mostly looks like metal spaghetti. Parents know there is a whole host of life skills that our children need to learn, but my reasons date back to my childhood. My father taught me how to do laundry, but no one talked about mental health - we covered up our issues with bro talk and the firm belief that real men don't cry. And no one said anything about finances. That might explain why I took out a 22% car loan when I was 24. To make it worse, both of my parents were accountants.  Forty-year-old me cringes at that memory. (Yes, I've let them know I hold a grudge.) Car repair, finances, cooking and mental health: There are so many skills we need to teach that it can often seem overwhelming. Which ones can they learn on their own? How much do we teach versus standing back and letting them learn from experience? I've continued these life skill lessons with my three children over the years - and I don't split the chores by gender. A smart person once told me that ""dishes don't care about gender,"" and I make it a point to give my sons - not just my daughter - the fundamentals they'll need as independent adults. Don't fear if you didn't start early with your children.  I've found the middle school years are a perfect time to teach many of them. Here's how I do it. Life skills start in the home I started my kids on household chores young because I refuse to send any of them into the world without being able to provide the most basic care for themselves. We started small such as teaching them how to crack an egg or load the washing machine. We made a game of it and let it get messy. With these small exposures, the kids were able to eventually get comfortable with the chore, gain competence and then finally achieve confidence. If there is pushback or lack of enthusiasm, don't worry about it. Consistency and patience is the key. Keep at it. Years into this experiment, my 13-year-old son can cook a basic meal and is in charge of cooking on Sunday nights.  That means planning, shopping and meal prep.  My 15-year-old daughter has her own night Saturday with the same responsibilities. She also does a lot of car maintenance with me. Everyone is responsible for their own laundry. Jessica Lahey, author of We do this by giving them clear expectations and then stepping away after we have taught them.  This allow our kids to take ownership of the task, and Lahey notes that they learn to solve problems  and deal with failure. Yes, we have had some magnificent disasters in this house - we all remember the great lemon tart disaster of 2018, and the banshee wail of the smoke alarms. Each one was a moment where we could come together as a family, figure out the solution and deal with the consequences. One of my biggest moments of pride was when my eighth-grade son taught his older cousin him how to grill the perfect All-American brat.   As a father, I'll admit, I teared up a bit as he double-clicked the tongs. It's all about the bills Money can be a taboo subject for many, as my own high-interest car loan experience can show.  This skill is much harder to teach for me because I'm not as comfortable with it.  But it's important to get underneath the hood of financial literacy and make sure our kids learn it. The Jump$tart Coalition CEO Laura Levine said that it makes a more lasting impact when a parent and a child learn together. The Jump$tart Coalition advocates for financial literacy in schools in grades K through 12. She recommends, like Lahey, to start with small and controlled exposure for our middle school children. ""Practice by using an app or student debit card. Teach on a smaller scale, within safety, but with the consequences of their actions,"" she said. ""To gain your child's interest, make sure the kids are presented with the discussion in a way that speaks to them. In a way that they can see themselves in the example."" That means I don't give my kids an allowance. There are chores they have to do because it's expected as part of the family.  But there are paying jobs around the home such as cleaning the garage and mom's car after she's had a long week at work. With that money, the kids build up their vacation funds.  This is money that they are free to spend how they choose.  I find that when they are responsible for their own money, they are more frugal.  We are also able to build savings habits that help them continue the practice as adults I have begun to include my kids a little bit when I do my taxes as well. So far, their takeaway is that dad is going to have to go to court if I don't pay my taxes (but it's a start.)  As they grow, they will become more involved so that the mystery of the skill is explained, and they will understand. Teaching mental health management Finally, like money, many parents have a hard time talking about mental health until it reaches a level of crisis. Learning to manage their mental health is a life skill that I cannot overlook. It has a way of affecting every other area of their lives, including cleaning, hygiene and managing their money responsibly. From doubt and anxiety to more serious issues, they need to learn coping skills now. How do we begin to broach these subjects?  There's a simple answer, but it's difficult in practice.  We teach our kids about mental health by being honest with them and showing them our struggles. That's not to say that we dump a parent's pandemic year or two on our children. But we are honest that we are anxious at times, or depressed, or doubt our abilities. Again, we start small in a way that they can understand. But we show them that not only is it OK to be vulnerable, but they are not alone. We make it a point to treat mental health the same way that we do our physical health.  Talking to a lot of fathers, most said that we lead by example. That means getting our own mental health checkups and being honest with those around. In the middle school years, there's such a wonderful opportunity to teach our children the skills they will eventually need. Just remember to develop comfort by introducing them to the subject in short, small bursts, develop competence by guiding them and let them achieve confidence with the skill once they take ownership.",Your children need life skills - this dad explains how to teach them
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/29/us/us-coronavirus-new-variant-what-we-know/index.html,"CNN The United States' first known case of the new coronavirus variant was The variant, called B.1.1.7, has been linked to the United Kingdom. The man who was infected is in his 20s, is isolating and appears to have no travel history, according to That man California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that the new variant has been found in the southern part of his state. Here's what we know about the variant: The new variant came from the UK The new variant is believed to have Public Health England says backward tracing, using genetic evidence, suggests the variant emerged in September. It then circulated in very low levels until mid-November. But scientists did not know whether the mutation originated in southeast England or was introduced there from elsewhere, said Sharon Peacock, professor of public health and microbiology at the University of Cambridge. Some experts have suggested the new variant could have been amplified because of a superspreader event, meaning the current spike in cases could also have been caused by human behavior. The new variant spreads more quickly Health authorities from around the world have said the variant does not appear to be more deadly than previously identified coronavirus strains. Initial analysis showed that while the variant appears to be more transmissible, there is no evidence it is linked to a higher risk of hospital admission or death, according to Public Health England. Scientists advising the UK government have estimated the variant could be up to 70% more effective at spreading than others. Peter Horby, chair of the UK's Speaking at an emergency meeting of the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee, Horby explained that the new variant has ""some kind of biological advantage to make it spread faster."" Scientists still don't have a complete picture as to why, he said, but they are investigating several scenarios. There is preliminary evidence to suggest the new strain results in a person holding a higher viral load, which means the virus is easier to pass on, Horby said. Scientist Neil Ferguson, a member of NERVTAG, said the variant may be more infectious for children. ""There is a hint is that (the variant) ... has a higher propensity to infect children,"" he said at a news briefing last week organized by the Science Media Centre, though he cautioned that more data was needed. Severe illness due to Covid-19 is still relatively rare for children. The new variant raises questions about vaccines There are no signs yet that the current vaccine front-runners won't work against this new variant, experts and drugmakers have said. The companies behind the first two vaccines to gain authorization in the United States - Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna - are testing their shots to double-check that they're effective against the variant. The coronavirus has mutated before, and both firms say their vaccines worked against other variations of the virus. Some US-based scientists have said it's possible the new variant might, to a small extent, undermine the vaccines. ""You could imagine some modest hit to vaccine efficacy, which wouldn't be good, but I don't think it will break the vaccine,"" said Trevor Bedford, an associate professor in the vaccine and infectious disease division of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Adm. Brett Giroir, US Health and Human Services assistant secretary, told ""Fox News Sunday"" officials neither have evidence nor do they believe the vaccine would not be effective against the new variant. ""We do believe the vaccine will be effective against this variant,"" he said. New variant likely in US for some time The United States will likely see ""homegrown variants"" of the coronavirus, similar to the one found in Colorado, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. ""That variant from the UK was noted in the UK back in September, and it's probably been in the US since September,"" Hotez told CNN's Jim Acosta on Tuesday. ""We're going to see homegrown variants that are similar in character in terms of transmissibility, I can almost promise you that."" Dr. Atul Gawande, a member of the Biden-Harris transition Covid advisory board and a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said the variant is almost certainly in several states. He said the fact that the Colorado man who has the variant didn't travel is a clue. ""An unknown travel history means that this person picked it up the community,"" Gawande said. ""Exactly how prevalent it is, is the real question. If it's been spreading, how dominant is it?"" Researchers have scoured genetic sequences of coronavirus in the United States to see if any match up with the UK variant. So far, they haven't found any, but they say that's likely because the US surveillance system isn't catching them. Fewer than half of 1% of all US coronavirus cases have been sequenced, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. At least two dozen countries affected The variant has already spread globally. As of December 29, at least 26 countries and Hong Kong have reported cases of the new variant. Aside from the United States, it has also been detected in Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia, according to WHO. Canada has also detected the new variant in Ontario, A similar but separate variant has been identified in South Africa, where scientists say it is spreading quickly along coastal areas of the country. British health authorities said two cases of the South African variant have been detected in the United Kingdom. The coronavirus variants discovered in the UK and South Africa are both ""more transmissible,"" said Susan Hopkins, managing director of Public Health England. Large swathes of England, including London and the southeast, are now under strict Tier 4 Covid-19 restrictions, and UK government health experts have suggested additional restrictions could be required to beat back this variant.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/03/uk/uk-faces-tougher-covid-restrictions-johnson-gbr-intl/index.html,"CNN Coronavirus restrictions in England are ""alas probably about to get tougher,"" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday, as the country battles to rein in a In an interview on the BBC's ""The Andrew Marr Show,"" Johnson was pressed over whether the restrictions currently in place in the worst-hit areas of England were doing enough, as hospitals fill up with Covid-19 patients. ""It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country, I'm fully reconciled with that,"" Johnson said. ""I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that,"" he added. Pressed to elaborate what those tougher restrictions might be, Johnson said: ""There are obviously a range of tougher measures that we would have to consider. I don't want to speculate, I'm not going to speculate now about what they would be. ""Clearly, school closures that we had to do in March is one of those things (...),"" he added, as the controversy over the government's mixed messages over schools reopening continues to dominate the headlines. Echoing his warning on the same program in October last year, Johnson warned: ""It is bumpy, and it's going to be bumpy."" But the Prime Minister insisted that by the spring the situation across the country should be improving as more people are vaccinated. Under the current system, most of England falls under the toughest Tier 3 and Tier 4 restrictions - with the latter in place for all of London - with a strict stay-at-home message. But some scientists have warned that stricter measures are needed if a new, more infectious variant of the virus, which has spread in recent weeks across London, southeast England and parts of Wales in particular, is to be brought under control. Keir Starmer, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, called Sunday for a nationwide lockdown to be imposed within the next 24 hours, saying the country ""can't afford"" further delay. ""The virus is clearly out of control and there's no good the Prime Minister hinting that further restrictions are coming into place in a week or two or three. That delay has been the source of so many problems,"" Starmer told reporters. ""So I say, bring in those restrictions now, national restrictions within the next 24 hours - that has to be the first step to controlling the virus."" Health workers are preparing to reactivate seven emergency Covid-19 Some London hospitals are now almost two-thirds full with Covid-19 patients, President of the Royal College of Physicians Andrew Goddard said Saturday. Both primary and secondary schools across London and some other parts of southeast England will remain closed for at least the next two weeks for in-person learning, except for vulnerable pupils and children of critical workers. The return of secondary school pupils has been delayed across England, with students to be taught remotely rather than in classrooms. Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" that more schools would have to close and urged the government to have a plan in place to ensure children's learning and help working parents manage homeschooling. However, school closures should be the last resort, he said. The UK has now registered more than 50,000 new Covid-19 cases for six days in a row, with 54,990 new confirmed cases reported on Sunday.  On Saturday, it recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections since the start of the pandemic, with 57,725 new coronavirus cases. The UK also reported 454 new deaths Sunday within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. The country has been among the hardest hit in Europe, with more than 2.6 million infections in total and more than 75,000 deaths. Mass vaccination hopes The UK government is pinning its hopes for a return to some kind of normality on a speedy rollout of vaccinations, prioritizing the elderly and those who are clinically vulnerable, as well as health and social care workers. Asked about the number of doses available of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which was approved by UK regulators on Wednesday, Johnson told Marr that 530,000 doses would be ready to be given from Monday, on top of ""the million or so"" Pfizer/BioNTechCovid-19 vaccine already distributed. However, he was unable to say how many doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were ready to be administered. ""We do hope that we will be able to do tens of millions [of Covid-19 vaccines] in the next three months, I can certainly give you that figure,"" the Prime Minister said. Johnson said this strategy relied on using three vaccines, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines - both of which were approved in the UK last month - and the Moderna vaccine, which would be ready to use ""soon."" Recalling what he said on the same program last October, Johnson said: ""I thought by the spring things would be better. I stick to that."" Earlier on Sunday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that the country had administered 1 million Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine doses, saying ""the end is in sight."" Batches of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine have begun arriving at hospitals ready for their use from Monday. The vaccine is cheaper and easier to distribute than the Pfizer/BioNTech jab because it can be kept at regular refrigerator temperatures for at least six months. Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines must be stored frozen. New variant threat First Minister for Scotland Nicola Sturgeon tweeted Sunday that her Cabinet would meet the next day to ""consider further action to limit spread"" of the more contagious variant that has driven up infection rates in England - and that she would recall Parliament to hear its decision. ""We, like other countries, are in a race between this faster spreading strain of Covid and the vaccination programme,"" she said. ""All decisions just now are tough, with tough impacts. Vaccines give us way out, but this new strain makes the period between now (and) then the most dangerous since start of pandemic. So the responsibility of government must be to act quickly (and) decisively in the national interest,"" she said. Johnson pushed back against a suggestion by Marr that his government had failed to prepare fully for the challenges of winter and the possibility of a mutation in the coronavirus, despite having been warned of the threats in a government-commissioned paper in July. ""This government has taken every possible step that we reasonably could to prepare this country for the consequences of winter,"" Johnson said. ""What we could not have foreseen, I think, reasonably, was the arrival of a new variant of the virus, which was spreading between 50 and 70% faster. Once we did understand that on, I think, December 18... we took decisive action."" As of January 1, at least 30 countries, including the United States, had reported cases of the more infectious variant of the coronavirus first detected in the UK. There's no evidence that the variant is any more deadly or causes more severe disease, according to health officials.",UK Prime Minister 'reconciled' to tougher Covid-19 restrictions as cases soar

""It's still a long way to go, but hopefully everybody comes and gets the vaccine, to get the country moving,"" he said. It's been tough for him not to be able to visit his parents in Chennai. ""In India, the situation has been even worse, so it's been difficult for them."" The rollout of vaccines to Britons, less than a week after the country became the first to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use, is the culmination of months of research, logistics planning and clinical tests. The pharmacists, nurses, health care workers and volunteers working in the vaccination center have been preparing for this moment for weeks. But for Chandra, the actual vaccine felt like just a little scratch on the arm. ""It was quick and not that painful,"" he said, adding that he will be encouraging his own patients to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Those who got a first dose today will need to return for a second in around three weeks' time. The nurses administering the jabs in the converted gymnasium were drafted in from hospitals and other health care facilities in and around Cardiff. Among themselves, they nicknamed Tuesday ""V-Day."" Sharon Chapman, a 60-year-old breast cancer specialist nurse, volunteered to be part of the program. She got a week-long training that included everything from how to administer the new vaccine to reassuring patients about the safety of the vaccine. ""I like to think we're injecting hope into people,"" she said. ""After the terrible year we've had, we are looking forward into the future now with this vaccine."" The hope is that if enough people take up the vaccine, herd immunity will be achieved and life will return to normal. But for now, the usual strict coronavirus safety protocols must be observed. Taped markings on the gym floor indicate the safe distance between individual chairs in the waiting area, slotted in between the usual boundaries of the basketball court. Two basketball hoops hang on the wall, just above the five booths where the vaccines are being administered. Dozens of medical aprons hang where the players' bench would normally be. The vaccines are stored under strictly controlled conditions in a fridge in a separate room. Two pharmacists, working in tandem, are tasked with unpacking each vial, diluting the vaccine in a sodium chloride and splitting it into five doses that are put into individual syringes. It's a new process for them. Normally, vaccines arrive already diluted and ready in the syringes. But because the vaccine is so new, there isn't the capacity yet to manufacture and fill the individual syringes. So it's up to Rhys Oats, a 34-year-old senior pharmacist, and his colleagues to do this on site. They've been preparing for weeks, doing simulation runs with vials filled with frozen water, testing the distribution and storage system. ""We had the first delivery of these vaccines in Wales here yesterday ... it was a momentous thing,"" he said. The demand for the vaccine is high and only a tiny fraction of those who want to get it can -- which is why the Welsh government has asked CNN to keep its exact location confidential. The first wave includes only frontline health and social care workers and people aged 80 and over. Michael Fox, a doctor at a pediatric emergency unit in Cardiff said he felt very grateful to be able to get the vaccine. ""It is a bit surreal,"" he said. ""The things I was thinking about on my journey in were how grateful I am for all the work that has been done in the scientific community, all the volunteers who have put themselves forward for the vaccine trials, and that hopefully, this will be the turn in the tide against Covid-19."" The 32-year-old doctor has another, more personal reason, to be grateful for the vaccine. He and his wife are expecting their first child in March. ""There's a slightly increased risk for ladies who are pregnant if they get Covid, so I am just hoping that once enough people are vaccinated and if Covid-19 is under control, then I'll be able to be in for the delivery with a slightly more normal experience for my wife,"" he said.",'We're injecting hope'
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/30/health/colorado-uk-coronavirus-variant/index.html,"CNN Health officials in a Colorado county believe they've found a second local case of a coronavirus variant from the United Kingdom - one that experts have said That news Wednesday came a day after the first known case of the variant in the US Both the confirmed case and the suspected instance involve National Guard members who had been working at the Good Samaritan Society assisted living facility in Simla, about 45 miles northeast of Colorado Springs, health officials said. Neither are residents of Elbert County, and they are isolating outside the county, health director Dwayne Smith said. There is ""no indication at this point"" that this event has gone beyond the facility and into the larger community, he said. The men were part of a team of six Guard members deployed to the Good Samaritan Society-Simla after a recent outbreak of Covid-19 caused a staff shortage. The first man had no known travel history, Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday. In part because of that, there is a good chance the variant has been spreading within the community, William Haseltine, chair and president of the global health think tank ACCESS Health International, told CNN on Wednesday. The variant In California, San Diego Supervisor Nathan Fletcher said a 30-year-old man with no travel history has the UK variant of the virus. The Colorado health department has been in communication with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about its cases. Smith did not know when the variant could be verified or ruled out definitively in the second person, he said. He was not able to comment on travel history for the men and said the state health department notified the county about the two men on Tuesday afternoon. The ""two individuals were working at the facility in non-clinical roles,"" Smith said. ""The state health department has deployed a rapid response team to the assisted living facility in Simla to test residents and staff."" Randy Fitzgerald, Good Samaritan Society regional vice president, said they expect results from those tests in a few days. Facility officials will ""work closely with the state while following the CDC's infection control measures,"" he added. Vaccinations will take place next week, he said. The Good Samaritan Society had a Covid-19 outbreak in the past two and a half weeks, and at least two people - a 93-year-old man and an 88-year-old woman - died, Smith said. A third death is being investigated, he said. The facility is home to about 25 residents.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/29/health/how-to-be-less-selfish-wellness/index.html,"CNN At dinnertime, you nab the best-looking pork chop for yourself from the family-style platter. When it's time to watch TV, you snatch the remote control before anyone else can get to it. Or maybe you take the last bit of hand sanitizer from the store shelf with little regard for whether others feel deep-seated anxiety about the coronavirus or need any themselves. You don't mean to be rude or pig-headed. You're just a little selfish. So what? Aren't we all self-serving? Selfishness may be in our biology No matter what your habits - never mind your intentions - most of us are inherently selfish beings. Some even argue that we are hard-wired to be selfish. British evolutionary biology and ethologist Richard Dawkins, building on Charles Darwin's ""survival of the fittest"" theory from the early 1800s, dubbed ""the selfish gene,"" otherwise known as that thing mothers have been telling their teenagers ad nauseam - humans are selfish! The theory posited that those of us who looked after ourselves first before others were more likely to survive, ""Looking deep into our most primitive selves, there is a deep-seated need to survive,"" said Dr. Cecily D. Havert, a physician at Northern Virginia Family Practice Associates in Alexandria, Virginia. ""This need, when you strip it down to its simplest parts, is based on fear and the need to feel in control of our surroundings and resources,"" she said. We do what we need to in order to survive. That doesn't, though, mean that our selfish actions are always justified. Selfishness has consequences Swooping in on that juicy pork chop or the last bit of hand sanitizer might satisfy your self-serving nature, but these choices have an impact on others, including those you claim to care about the most. Selfishness comes from a ""scarcity mentality, which usually fuels a constant drive to get more and have more and to give away less,"" said Dr. Mark Goulston, a Boston-based psychiatrist, author and podcaster, who wrote the book, "" There is no benefit to being truly selfish, said Sharie Stines, a California-based psychologist, author and life coach, who believes that the selfish behaviors we see in most people today come from false notions of what happiness means in a culture that tells us at every turn that we must seek the ultimate happiness. People who are content, who are grateful for all that they have and don't seek more, tend to be less selfish than those who are discontent. ""When people are discontent(ed) they tend to become more self-concerned, which in turn, becomes self-centeredness, thus leading to selfishness,"" Stines said. ""I have often noticed that relationships are ruined because of one selfish person."" Thinking of yourself first has the potential to not only hurt those you love most, but can also have negative impacts on broader society (that gas-guzzling SUV will also contribute to the destruction of the planet your grandchildren and mine will inherit). Our actions impact others, this we know. And our actions are the manifestation of our thoughts, which can be selfish or selfless in nature. Sometimes it really is that simple. What's more, a selfish mentality doesn't really work in today's global society, where we really must think of the larger whole and community when we make decisions if we are to survive, Havert said. ""Being selfish and looking inward about one's individual survival does not really work in this context,"" she said. We have a choice in the matter Despite what some say about the inherent nature of selfishness, there is some evidence that humans are perfectly capable of acts of selflessness and altruism that do not chip away at their evolutionary ability to outlive others. In fact, being selfish may even prevent you from getting ahead, according to a We can choose to be selfless just as we can choose to be selfish. We can serve our significant other the best pork chop on the platter. It is possible. We do not lose anything by committing these acts of consideration, of selflessness. In fact, acts of selflessness can actually make us feel better, not to mention, more upstanding global citizens. When people chose to give their money away rather than keep it, they reported being happier, according to a How to embrace selflessness To break the line of selfish thinking, simple acts to refocus attention onto someone else can help. ""People don't do what's important to them. They do what they care enough about. Therefore, you need to care enough about being less selfish to make the effort to be that way,"" Goulston said. Acts of selflessness can be as simple, he said, as handing out a healthy snack to a homeless person or asking someone else what makes them smile. Acknowledging what we have is an important step to becoming less selfish, according to Stines. ""We are most content when we focus on the other person and find ways to make their life better for us being in it,"" she said. The practice of ""getting outside of yourself"" also helps, Stines said. That means actively listening when you are talking to someone and performing acts of service to make their life easier or more comfortable. ""Rather than making the search for happiness your priority, make your priority other people's happiness,"" she said. In a nutshell All selfishness isn't created equal. There are, of course, varying degrees of prioritizing self over others. Taking the best-looking pork chop at family dinner isn't in the same class as say, taking the last remaining shopping cart from an old lady or trampling someone's dahlias to get your stray soccer ball. And those acts of selfishness are not nearly as bad as cheating on your significant other, lying to get votes, or instituting martial law to seize what you want. There is also a distinction between selfishness and self-protection. ""Self-protection, self-care, and personal boundaries are all meant to protect the self and also the other person,"" Stines said. Maybe it's even OK to be a little bit selfish sometimes -- particularly if you fall on other end of the spectrum and default to putting others before yourself with acts of extreme selflessness. Go ahead, you have permission to unabashedly polish off the pint of sherbet in the freezer this one time.","If you took every last hand sanitizer, here's why it pays to be less selfish"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/08/politics/trump-vaccine-pfizer-coronavirus-executive-order/index.html,"CNN  On Tuesday, the An administration official described Tuesday's event as a ""publicity stunt"" sought by Trump to take credit for the development of the vaccine. The President also said during the signing, which took place during a coronavirus vaccine summit at the White House, that he would invoke the Defense Production Act against companies creating the vaccines if they have ""any problems."" It's not clear whether Trump could use the act to force companies to provide Americans with the coronavirus vaccine before other nations. But despite Trump's victory lap at the summit, members of his administration are questioning whether there will be enough vaccines to go around. The ""The current vaccine implementation will not substantially reduce viral spread, hospitalizations, or fatalities until the 100 million Americans with comorbidities can be fully immunized, which will take until the late spring,"" a weekly report by the panel, obtained by CNN, read. ""Behavioral change and aggressive mitigation policies are the only widespread prevention tools that we have to address this winter surge."" An administration official told CNN it was a mistake for the Trump administration not to leave the door open to purchase more Pfizer coronavirus vaccine doses earlier this summer. The official said the US simply may have to hope that the other vaccines being produced by other companies are just as effective as the Pfizer doses. ""They shouldn't have closed the door,"" the official said, adding that ""they could have left the door open"" to purchasing more doses. If the other vaccines being manufactured by Pfizer's rivals are not as effective, it could have a detrimental effect on inoculating the American public, the official said. ""It's going to look bad,"" the official added. On Monday, some senior administration officials denied reports that the administration passed on the Pfizer offer, and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany echoed that denial to CNN's Joe Johns on Tuesday morning. But her deputy press secretary, Brian Morgenstern, told Fox News later Tuesday that there were ""options"" with Pfizer under discussion, but that the talks didn't get into the details of the potential purchase. ""When we went to discuss exercising those options, we never got to whether we'd have one dose or 100 million, whether it would be tomorrow or 10 years, so when we're in that kind of status, I think it's disingenuous to say there was an offer there that we really could have accepted moving forward,"" Morgenstern said. The official familiar with the situation confirmed that Trump administration officials passed up a chance to purchase more than the 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine it agreed to earlier this summer. The decision was made as part of a plan to ""diversify"" the nation's vaccine arsenal, the official said, adding that members of the administration's ""Operation Warp Speed"" effort to mass produce a coronavirus vaccine were trying ""not put all their eggs in one basket."" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, also told CNBC something similar, adding that he believes the government ""made a bet"" that they could potentially purchase vaccines from multiple manufacturers, not just Pfizer. The decision to not purchase more Pfizer doses, which was A senior administration official told CNN that one of the primary reasons the US did not exercise the option to buy additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine was because the company could not commit to a specific number of doses and a timetable for delivering them. Without a firm delivery date or quantity - and with other vaccine candidates in the works as well - the US held off on placing the order for additional doses. Pfizer declined to comment on the timeline issues, pointing to an earlier statement from company spokeswoman Amy Rose that said: ""Any additional doses beyond the 100 million are subject to a separate and mutually-acceptable agreement. The company is not able to comment on any confidential discussions that may be taking place with the US government."" Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser of Operation Warp Speed, said that summer was not the time to buy more vaccine doses - and that the right time to do that is when it becomes clear how well the vaccines perform. ""Let me remind everybody what our strategy is and has always been,"" Slaoui told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday. ""We selected six different vaccines to build the portfolio, to manage the risk that some may work and some may not work, but also to ensure that as more than one would work that we would accumulate vaccine doses from this portfolio of vaccines."" Slaoui also refused to weigh in on ""Frankly, I don't know - and frankly, I'm staying out of this, so I can't comment,"" Slaoui told Stephanopoulos. Stephanopoulos pressed Slaoui, asking, ""You don't know? But you're the chief science adviser for Operation Warp Speed?"" ""Our work is, you know, rolling. We have plans we feel that we can deliver the vaccines as needed, so I don't know exactly what this order is about,"" Slaoui responded.",Trump makes another largely symbolic effort to combat coronavirus
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/09/health/men-covid-19-icu-admission-wellness/index.html,"CNN In the early weeks and months of the coronavirus pandemic, medics and health professionals working in hospitals around the world noticed that Now, a global analysis of over 3 million Covid-19 cases from January to June has found that male patients with the disease have ""almost three times the odds"" of What's more, men were almost 1.4 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than women - although both sexes have an equivalent risk of infection. The researchers analyzed data from 90 reports involving 46 countries and 44 US states. This data showed that, among the cases in the study, about 1.57 million were women and about 1.53 million were men. Yet when it came to data on over 12,000 admissions to hospital intensive care units, about 8,000 of those were men and 4,000 were women, the researchers found. And among the over 200,000 Covid-19 deaths included in the study, about 120,000 were men and 91,000 were women.  The many parts of the immune system that work together to defend the body against viruses do not operate exactly the same way in men and women, and the study said that more research is needed to determine which specific biological factors may be driving these differences. ""Men and women have differences in almost all arms of the immune system. These range from the early immune responses to viral infection, to T cell responses, B cell responses and immune memory,"" said study author Dr. Kate Webb, a consultant pediatric rheumatologist at the University of Cape Town and The Francis Crick Institute in London. ""There are many potential reasons for these differences in immunity: hormones have immunological effects and women have two X chromosomes compared to one in men. X chromosomes are packed full of genes which code for immunity."" Sex is 'an under-appreciated variable' Many diseases attack men and women in different ways. Why this is can depend on a complex mix of biology and behavior that is difficult to untangle. Men are more likely in some cultures to leave the house and visit more crowded areas. They're also Other explanations for the disparity include men being more likely to have certain preexisting health conditions, or comorbidities, that put them at risk. The researchers said, however, that they did not have enough data on these factors. The team noted, though, that there are no marked sex differences in the proportions of adults globally with hypertension (high blood pressure) or diabetes, and those are the most commonly reported comorbidities in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Men are also more likely to smoke, but the study said smoking had not emerged as a clear risk factor. During previous coronavirus epidemics, the study said that men were reported to have a worse clinical outcome during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and Singapore. They also had a higher risk of dying from MERS in Saudi Arabia. From an evolutionary perspective, some research has suggested that women have a stronger immune response against viral infections than men because they are biologically designed to The authors of the study said that sex remained ""an under-appreciated variable when interrogating outcomes in infectious diseases."" ""Sex has been traditionally under-appreciated in scientific research, ranging from basic laboratory to bedside clinical research,"" Webb said via email. ""Including females in basic laboratory research introduces variation that would not exist if only male cell or animal models were used, so they were usually excluded. Sex based differences are often missed even in the earliest laboratory research.""","Men face 'almost three times the odds' of ICU admission for Covid-19, study says"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/29/health/who-rapid-test-kits-intl/index.html,"CNN The World Health Organization has announced an agreement to make rapid Covid-19 tests available to lower and middle-income countries across the world. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general said, ""a substantial proportion of these rapid tests - 120 million - will be made available to low and middle-income countries. These tests provide reliable results in approximately 15 to 30 minutes, rather than hours or days, at a lower price, with less sophisticated equipment."" Tedros said during a Monday news conference that these ""vital"" tests will help expand testing in remote areas, ""that do not have lab facilities or enough trained health workers to carry out PCR tests."" He added: ""High-quality rapid tests show us where the virus is hiding, which is key to quickly tracing and isolating contacts and breaking the chains of transmission. The tests are a critical tool for governments as they look to reopen economies and ultimately save both lives and livelihoods."" The first orders are expected already to be placed this week and it will be rolled out in up to 20 countries in Africa starting in October. Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund said the tests are hugely valuable as a complement to PCR tests but warned that they are not ""a silver bullet."" ""Although they're a bit less accurate - they're much faster, cheaper, and don't require a lab,"" he explained. ""Being able to deploy quality antigen RDTs, rapid diagnostic tests, will be a significant step forward in enabling countries to contain and combat Covid-19,"" Sands added. The PCR test is the most widespread and most accurate diagnostic test for determining whether someone is currently infected with coronavirus.  However, the tests requires specialized supplies, expensive instruments, and the expertise of trained lab technicians. which has led to shortages and a testing gap globally.  Sands said these tests will help low and middle-income countries to ""close the dramatic gap in testing between rich and poor countries."" ""Right now, high-income countries are conducting 292 tests per day per 100,000 people. For upper-middle-income countries, that number is 77.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/16/health/covid-19-vaccine-trial-black-minority-recruitment/index.html,"CNN The multi-billion-dollar effort to get a coronavirus vaccine on the market could see delays because researchers haven't recruited sufficient numbers of minorities to join the clinical trials. Of the 350,000 people who've registered online for a coronavirus clinical trial, 10% are Black or Latino, according to Dr. Jim Kublin, executive director of operations for the That's not nearly enough, as study subjects in trials are supposed to reflect the population that's affected. Research shows that more than half of US coronavirus cases have been among Black and Latino people. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, gave the Moderna trial, the first in Phase 3 in the United States, a ""C"" grade for recruiting minorities. ""From the first week I saw the numbers, and they were not as encouraging as I would have liked,"" Collins told CNN. The stakes are high. Operation Warp Speed, the government's effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, says it If not enough Black people and other minorities enroll, the panel of experts who monitor the trials could force a delay until they get the numbers they need. ""That's something that's been actively discussed,"" said Dr. Nelson Michael, coordinator of community engagement activities for Operation Warp Speed. ""There's a lot of concern."" Michael said several factors have led to ""a perfect storm of not goodness"" for recruiting Black study subjects: historical abuse of Black people in Black leaders agree that it's a challenge to recruit Black people into the vaccine trials, especially since it needs to happen very quickly - the first two Phase 3 clinical trials started in late July and expect to finish enrollment in September. ""This is a very, very tall order,"" said Dr. James Powell, a Cincinnati physician who has been approached with requests to encourage Black participation in the vaccine trials. ""When we Black people hear 'clinical trials,' we think 'we're not going to be researched on,' and that's across economic status and across educational status, not just one sector,"" said Renee Mahaffey Harris, president of The Center for Closing the Health Gap in Cincinnati. Moderna and Pfizer, the two US companies currently in Phase 3 trials, won't reveal how many of their participants are from minority groups. Each trial eventually expects to recruit 30,000 participants. Moderna's 89 trial sites across the United States are ""actively working within their local communities to reach a diverse population of volunteers,"" Ray Jordan, a company spokesman, wrote in an email. ""We hope to achieve a shared goal that the participants in the (Covid-19 vaccine) study are representative of the communities at highest risk for COVID-19 and of our diverse society."" A Fourth of July Zoom call At 10:20 p.m. on July 3, NIH's Collins sent an email to colleagues asking for a Zoom meeting the next day. ""I certainly ruined everybody's holiday,"" Collins remembers. But he said the topic was ""absolutely critical."" He wanted to discuss how to recruit groups such as minorities and older people into the trials. Collins says he told those at the July 4 meeting, including Michael and Dr. Anthony Fauci, that they had to make sure the trials ""didn't go down the wrong path, because the default was clearly going to be that a lot of young white people would be likely to sign up, and we would have a trial that was scientifically way short of what it needed to be and would not engender anybody's confidence."" Federal law and NIH policy If an insufficient number of minorities sign up, the experts monitoring the trials might require additional recruitment. ""The Data Safety Monitoring Board could slow the trial down,"" Michael said. ""If the demographics aren't right, they could tell the sponsor to slow enrollment down until you hit different numbers. They could say 'We do not want you to develop a vaccine tested for safety and efficacy basically on a single ethnic group.' "" There's another reason why researchers are trying to include minorities. If everyone who volunteered for a coronavirus vaccine trial got their shot and then stayed home, at the end of the study they would likely all test negative for the virus, not necessarily because the vaccine worked, but because they never encountered the virus in the first place. That's why in any vaccine study, including this one, researchers seek out study subjects who are most likely to come in contact with the virus in their daily lives. That's health care workers, for example, and also minorities, who are more likely to have essential jobs that require in-person work, and more likely to live in multigenerational, multifamily households, among other factors.  Since about half of case reports don't indicate race, researchers have also looked at the incidence of Covid-19 on a county level. While nearly 20% of US counties are disproportionately Black, they account for 52% of Covid-19 diagnoses and 58% of Covid-19 deaths nationally, according to the report published last month in the After that Fourth of July meeting, the mission was clearer than ever: Engage minority communities to encourage them to join the clinical trials. ""There is a tremendous amount of pressure on this now. I've never seen community engagement get this level of play. Not even close. Ever,"" Michael said. 'I'm an old white guy' Collins and Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have made it clear they they're not the ones to speak directly to minorities to increase trust in vaccines. ""I'm an old white guy at NIH,"" Fauci ""You want to go into the African American community with people who look and think and act like the people you're trying to convince,"" he said. That's Mahaffey Harris, who has been doing advocacy and development work with minority communities for 30 years. On August 5, Mahaffey Harris received a call from a doctor asking her to recruit minorities into the Moderna vaccine trial. She knows she didn't give him the answer he was looking for. At this point, Mahaffey Harris won't recruit people for the clinical trials. She won't even put information about the trials on ""I am always cautious when I'm being contacted by anyone involved in pharmaceutical research because I, as a Black woman, never want to be a part of engaging and recruiting people for research that ends up having any bias in it or any hint of impropriety, like what happened at Tuskegee,"" she said. She told the coronavirus researcher she will meet with him later this month. She has received these calls in the past for other clinical trials. ""They'll say, 'I need 100 people' and I say, 'I'm not just going to get you 100 people,"" she said. None of this surprises Dawn Baker, the first person in the United States to receive a coronavirus vaccine as part of a Phase 3 clinical trial. After getting her first shot, Baker, a Black TV news anchor in Savannah, Georgia, received much love and support from her community, but also disbelief. ""Dawn done lost her damn mind,"" one woman wrote on Facebook. ""i got 2 words...TUSKEGEE EXPERIMENT,"" another wrote, referring to the infamous medical studies that abused Black men. Two people just posted GIFs of Black people shaking their heads ""no."" Baker received her shot three weeks ago, but said concerned Black people are still coming up to her, asking if she's feeling OK. ""I told them I've never felt better,"" said Baker, who doesn't know if she received the vaccine or the placebo. ""But I can tell they're not sure if they believe me."" Government efforts to engage minorities The NIH says it has ""engagement efforts"" with various groups, such as those that represent Black churches and Black doctors and nurses. Operation Warp Speed, a part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, says it has engaged with minority organizations as well. Collins noted that some of the Moderna sites are commercial and others are a part of NIH's network. He said when the trial began July 27, the commercial sites started up first, and the NIH sites have opened up more recently. ""The NIH funded sites are in a better position to be able to emphasize and do the community engagements, to try to reach out to minority communities,"" he said. ""Watch this space - we're going to see this improve I think fairly rapidly,"" he said. He added he had a meeting with top Moderna executives on July 10. ""I heard from them that they were really committed to this kind of diversity in enrollment,"" Collins said. ""I heard absolutely strong endorsement of that from Stephane Bancel, the CEO, and from Stephen Hoge, the president. I was not concerned that they were considering this just a nice thing to do; they were clearly very committed."" The NIH set up the Covid-19 Prevention Network to recruit participants into the trials. In the next week to 10 days, the network will be releasing materials, such as print and radio spots and videos for social media, targeted to specific groups, including minorities, according to Kublin, the network's executive director of operations. ""I wish it had started a month go,"" Kublin said. ""We have, all of us, been working 24/7 to make this happen as quickly as possible."" Michele Andrasik, the director of community engagement for the network, said she recognizes the hurdle to recruiting minorities for trials, but is optimistic that progress can be made as her group works on outreach programs in partnership with community groups. ""I think there are ways we can address the challenges that are inherent at the pace of what we've all been asked to do,"" Andrasik said. What's not working: warp speed As the name Operation Warp Speed suggests, the government and pharmaceutical companies are working quickly to come up with a vaccine against Covid-19. Moderna and Pfizer started their Phase 3 trials July 27 and plan to fully enroll them in September. That's a speed unheard of in the history of vaccine clinical trials. But Black leaders interviewed for this story said mistrust of medical institutions and the government, based on centuries of abuse and injustices, can't be undone that fast. ""That doesn't happen at warp speed,"" said Dr. James Powell, a principal investigator for Project IMPACT, or Increase Minority Participation and Awareness of Clinical Trials, a part of the ""They're not going to get the numbers for next month that they want. You have to build that trust,"" added Dr. Doris Browne, the president of the NMA. This mistrust is not just based on the It's also the legacy of Dr. J. Marion Sims, considered the father of modern gynecology, who in the mid-1800s experimented on slaves in the South, performing surgeries without their consent and without the use of anesthesia before surgery. And from the 1940s until the 1970s, in several studies, researchers exposed hundreds of study subjects, mostly Black people, to potentially fatal amounts of radiation, according to Harriet Washington, author of ""Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Experimentation from Colonial Times to the Present."" Injustices and disparities continue to this day. ""African-American people get treated differently. They have less access to doctors. When they describe their symptoms, they are not believed as often as Whites are. Medical technology is withheld from them. All of these things are a matter of record,"" said Washington, a lecturer in bioethics at Columbia University. ""Now we're approaching them with an experimental vaccine that we're offering as a benefit - but asking people to trust that is asking a great deal,"" she added. ""There's a risk to taking an experimental vaccine. There's just no way to sugar coat that."" Phase 1 and 2 trials of experimental coronavirus vaccines, with dozens or hundreds of study subjects each, have shown the vaccine to be safe. While some participants did experience symptoms such as fever and muscle aches, they felt better after a day or two. Black leaders interviewed for this story said part of the problem is they were contacted by vaccine researchers just days or weeks ago, which didn't leave them much time. John Daniels is an attorney advising a Covid-19 advisory group for the ""This has to be vetted through a process,"" he said. ""At the Church of God in Christ we have a health advisory group that involves a dozen or so national experts and it takes time to walk through this and translate it to the 1,500 ministers and say what are we going to do for the six to eight million people who are in our church."" Daniels and other leaders wondered why they were contacted so recently when it's been known for many months that minorities would be needed in the trial. ""The researchers knew where they needed to be. Why did they wait until now?"" said Powell of Project IMPACT. The key for researchers to get what they want, he and others said, is to invest in long-term relationships with the Black community, and not call just at the beginning of a trial, asking Black people to roll up their sleeves and take the injections. ""Mistrust is always there when you don't invest in trustworthiness,"" he said. Browne, the NMA president, said the vaccine researchers should have involved Black doctors from the start, as part of the planning and implementation of the trials. ""We are not in any way going to come in at the last minute to be utilized as an entree to get African-Americans or other people of color involved in a program where we don't have a clear understanding of every phase of it,"" she said. What could work: relationships Dr. Paul Bradley knew in advance that his office in Savannah would be the very first site in the United States to give someone an injection in a Phase 3 coronavirus clinical trial. He knew that the first person he injected would get media attention. He thought about who that person should be, and Dawn Baker's name came immediately to mind. Bradley has been Baker's family doctor for more than 30 years. He knows Baker is well-loved and has tremendous credibility in Savannah. Plus, he knew that, as a local TV anchor, she would handle interviews flawlessly. And yes, she's Black - that was a bonus, he said. He knew she'd inspire other Black people, and White people, too, to join the trial. He asked her if she was interested, and she said yes. ""We've developed a great rapport. I go to events, and he's there. I've met his family. It's not just a medical relationship. I really do trust him,"" Baker said. ""I knew Dr. Bradley wouldn't do anything to hurt me."" The next day, many of the people who came to Bradley's office to volunteer - both Black and White - cited Baker as the reason. Baker said she knows there's resistance in her community to joining clinical trials, and she hopes she made a difference. ""Maybe since I was at least bold enough to come forward right now, that might change that - that could eventually save their lives,"" she said. ""I hope that maybe just seeing my face will help them to change their opinions about that."" Bradley's connections to the community helped in other ways, too. He's known Savannah Mayor Van Johnson for years, and the two have discussed the trials. After they talked, the mayor posted an article about the trials on his Facebook page. Recently on his ""I don't take this lightly, to speak the truth and tell people to check it out and be a part of something,"" the mayor said. ""If it wasn't for the people who stood up for the polio trials, we'd still have polio around."" Then Bradley spoke with Ricky Temple, pastor of Overcoming by Faith, one of the largest churches in Savannah with 3,000 members. Ask any vaccine researcher about recruiting Black clinical trial participants, and they'll mention the power of churches. Their hope is that during a Sunday sermon, a preacher will encourage his or her flock to sign up. Before he spoke with Bradley, CNN asked Temple if he'd ever consider speaking about the trials from his Sunday pulpit. Temple laughed. ""You can't just have a preacher say, 'in our announcements today, trials are going to be held, and they're looking for Black people,'"" Temple said. ""The audience is going to be - 'What they're going to come and put a germ in me?' They're going to be scared to death - ""you gonna put coronavirus in me?'"" After speaking with Bradley, Temple surveyed those close to him in the church, asking if he should bring the clinical trials up at a Sunday service. ""I met with my staff, and no one supported me doing it. They were 100% no, because of Tuskegee. I asked members, I asked families, and I got the same response. It was incredibly consistent. What I heard was fear,"" Temple said. Temple's decision: to create a ""courageous conversation"" about the clinical trials with leaders in his church. ""We're big readers in our church, and I'll send out some documents. We have many medical professionals in our congregation, and I'll get them together, and we'll discuss this,"" he said. He wonders why he has to put together documents that can address the fears about clinical trials.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/13/health/brain-aerobic-exercise-wellness/index.html,"CNN Why is everyone telling us to exercise while we're stuck at home? Because if there is a single thing you could do to improve your health, it would be to get up and get moving. Breaking a sweat has been shown to improve nearly every organ in the body, fight nearly every disease doctors diagnose and improve nearly every health condition that you might live with on a daily basis. Your brain loves it, too. Increasing your heart rate pumps more oxygen-rich blood to the brain, stimulating the release of hormones that boost the production of new brain cells and enhance connectivity between parts of the brain. A ""Even if you start an exercise program later in life, the benefit to your brain may be immense,"" said study author Marc Poulin, an exercise physiology and nutrition professor at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada. ""Our study showed that six months' worth of vigorous exercise may pump blood to regions of the brain that specifically improve your verbal skills as well as memory and mental sharpness,"" Poulin said. The study, published Wednesday in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, followed 206 adults with an average age of 66 and no prior cognitive issues. Under supervision, they increased their aerobic exercise from 20 to 40 minutes three times a week and exercised on their own one day a week. An ultrasound measured blood flow to the brain at the start of the study, and a cognitive baseline was established on thinking and memory tests. Six months later, the participants were retested. Blood flow had increased, and tests of executive function, which includes mental flexibility and self-correction, had improved by nearly 6%. Verbal fluency, which tests how quickly you can retrieve information, increased by 2.4%, the study found. ""This change in verbal fluency is what you'd expect to see in someone five years younger,"" Poulin said. Because the study did not compare the people doing the exercise to a control group of similar people who were not exercising, the study cannot know for sure if exercise was the reason for the improvement in cognition. Still, to find an increase in memory and thinking skills at a time in life when they would be ""expected to be decreasing due to normal aging, to have these types of increases is exciting,"" Poulin said. Even more exciting: disproving that old saw that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Maybe they just didn't exercise the pooch enough!",Get up off that couch!

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/17/health/deaths-secondhand-smoke-wellness/index.html,"CNN It took a mere 52 smokers to kill one person via secondhand smoke in 2016, according to a new analysis of worldwide statistics on the impact of smoking. Considering there are an estimated billion smokers in the world, that means a million people die each year simply by inhaling the smoke around them, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open. ""There's a sense of secondhand smoke being benign, or not as damaging as the actual smoking is,"" said study co-author Dr. Jagat Narula, associate dean of global affairs at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. ""But it's truly deadly,"" Narula added. ""This study confirms what other research has shown: That nonsmokers are at risk from secondhand smoke and that no one should be exposed to it,"" said Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, who was not involved in the study. ""While it may be called 'secondhand,' the health effects of those exposed are truly firsthand,"" Rizzo said. Role of smokers Secondhand smoke is defined as the mixture of the smoke breathed out by the smoker combined with the smoldering end of a cigarette, cigar or pipe. According to the Even a low dose of secondhand smoke can contribute to sudden infant death and cause ear infections and asthma attacks in children while causing cancer and heart disease in adults. ""In 2006 the US Surgeon General declared there was no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke,"" Rizzo said. While the harmful effects of secondhand smoke have been known for years, no one knew the full impact on deaths on a global basis, Narula said. ""We wanted to calculate how many smokers are needed to kill one innocent nonsmoker,"" he said. The Mount Sinai researchers worked in tandem with colleagues at the Amsterdam Medical Center, Amsterdam UMC, to analyze a number of datasets from the World Health Organization, the Global Burden of Disease Reports, International Mortality and Smoking Statistics and others. They looked at the number of active smokers and secondhand smoke victims over a 26-year period from 1990 to 2016. They developed a ""secondhand smoke index"" and applied it to North America; South Asia; Middle East and North Africa; East Asia and Pacific; Europe and Central Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean. Globally, in 1990 it took only 31 smokers to kill one person; in 2016 that number rose to 52 smokers, the study found - an improvement due to smoking bans in restaurants, business and the like in some countries. North America had the most favorable secondhand smoke index: around 86 smokers for each death. The Middle East and Southeast Asia had least favorable numbers due to few protective measures -- around 43 smokers to one death. More protections needed, study says Despite the advances in some countries, the absolute number of people who smoked between 1990 and 2016 has been on the rise, the study says. That's mostly due to the increase in smoking in China and India and other low-to-middle income countries, a trend which is expected to continue. ""This study demonstrates the devastating effect of secondhand smoke,"" Narula said. By putting the blame for deaths directly at the feet of smokers, he added, this study will hopefully ""influence public opinion against secondhand smoke exposure"" and encourage governments to pass and enforce ""stringent"" anti-tobacco controls. While developing countries need to step up their game, there is still much to be done in the US and other developed countries, said lead author Dr. Leonard Hofstra, a professor of cardiology at Amsterdam UMC. ""There is a lot to gain when it comes to strengthening policies to protect nonsmokers, especially children,"" he said. ""For example, it should not be allowed for parents to smoke inside their cars with them."" Twenty-two states in the US have ""not yet passed comprehensive laws protecting their citizens - and the Lung Association calls on them to do so,"" Rizzo said, adding that the public can also make use of online tools provided by the American Lung Association ""to end their addiction."" CNN reached out to various tobacco companies for their response but did not hear back before our publication deadline.","Secondhand smoke kills one person for every 52 smokers, study says.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/health/seniors-pandemic-pods-winter-partner-wellness/index.html,"Kaiser Health News Over the past month, Dr. Richard Besdine and his wife have been discussing whether to see family and friends indoors this fall and winter. He thinks they should, so long as people have been taking strict precautions during the coronavirus pandemic. She's not convinced it's safe, given the heightened risk of viral transmission in indoor spaces. Both are well positioned to weigh in on the question. Besdine, 80, was the longtime director of the division of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Brown University's Alpert Medical School. His wife, Terrie Wetle, 73, also an aging specialist, was the founding dean of Brown's School of Public Health. ""We differ, but I respect her hesitancy, so we don't argue,"" Besdine said. Older adults in all kinds of circumstances -- those living alone and those who are partnered, those in good health and those who are not -- are similarly deliberating what to do as days and nights turn chilly and coronavirus cases rise across the country. Some are Judith Rosenmeier, 84, of Boston, a widow who has survived three bouts of breast cancer, doesn't intend to invite friends to her apartment or visit them in theirs. ""My oncologist said when all this started, 'You really have to stay home more than other people because the treatments you've had have destroyed a lot of your immune defenses,'"" she said. Since mid-March, Rosenmeier has been outside only three times: once, in September, to go to the eye doctor and twice since to walk with a few friends. After living in Denmark for most of her adult life, she doesn't have a lot of close contacts. Her son lives in Edinburgh, Scotland. ""There's a good chance I'll be alone on Thanksgiving and on Christmas, but I'll survive,"" she said. A friend who lives nearby, Joan Doucette, 82, is determined to maintain in-person social contacts. With her husband, Harry Fisher, 84, she's formed a ""pod"" with two other couples in her nine-unit apartment building. All are members of Beacon Hill Village, an organization that provides various services to seniors aging in place. Doucette sees her pod almost every day. ""We're always running up and down the stairs or elevator and bringing each other cookies or soup,"" she said. ""I don't think I would have survived this pandemic without that companionship."" About once a week, the couples have dinner together and ""we don't wear masks,"" said Jerry Fielder, 74, who moved to Boston two years ago with his partner, Daniel, 73. But he said he feels safe because ""we know where everyone goes and what they do: We're all on the same page. We go out for walks every day, all of us. Otherwise, we're very careful."" Eleanor Weiss, 86, and her husband are also members of the group. ""I wear a mask, I socially distance myself, but I don't isolate myself,"" Weiss said. This winter, she said, she'll see ""a few close friends"" and three daughters who live in the Boston area. One daughter is hosting Thanksgiving at her house, and everyone will get tested for the coronavirus beforehand. ""We're all careful. We don't hug and kiss. We do the elbow thing,"" Weiss said. In Chicago, Arthur Koff, 85, and his wife, Norma, 69, don't yet have plans for Thanksgiving or Christmas. ""It's up in the air depending on what's happening with the virus,"" he said. The couple has a wide circle of friends. ""I think it's going to be a very hard winter,"" said Koff, who has diabetes and blood cancer. He doesn't plan to go to restaurants but hopes to meet some friends he trusts inside their homes or apartments when the weather turns bad. Julie Freestone, 75, and her husband, Rudi Raab, 74, are ""pretty fanatic"" about staying safe during the pandemic. The couple invited six friends over for ""Thanksgiving in October"" earlier this month -- outside, in their backyard in Richmond, California. ""Instead of a seating chart, this year I had a plating chart and I plated everything in advance,"" Freestone said. ""I asked everybody to tell me what they wanted -- white or dark meat? Brussels sprouts or broccoli?"" This winter, Freestone isn't planning to see people inside, but she'll visit with people in groups, virtually. One is her monthly women's group, which has been getting together over Zoom. ""In some ways, I feel we've reached a new level of intimacy because people are struggling with so many issues -- and we're all talking about that,"" she said. ""I think you need to redefine bubbles,"" said Freestone, who's on the board of Ashby Village, a Berkeley, California-based organization for seniors aging in place that's hosting lots of virtual groups. ""It should be something you feel a part of, but it doesn't have to be people who come into your house."" In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in Minnesota, two psychologists -- Leni de Mik, 79, and Brenda Hartman, 65 -- are calling attention to what they call SILOS, an acronym for ""single individuals left out of social circles,"" and their need for dependable social contact this winter and fall. They recommend that older adults in this situation reach out to others with similar interests -- people they may have met at church or in book clubs or art classes, for instance -- and try to form a group. Similarly, they recommend that families or friends invite a single older friend into their pods or bubbles. ""Look around at who's in your community. Who used to come to your house that you haven't seen? Reach out,"" de Mik recommended. Both psychologists are single and live alone. De Mik's pod will include two friends who are ""super careful outside,"" as she is. Hartman's will include her sister, 67, and her father, 89, who also live alone. Because her daughter works in an elementary school, she'll see her only outside. Also, she'll be walking regularly with two friends over the winter. ""Covid brings life and death right up in front of us,"" Hartman said, ""and when that happens, we have the opportunity to make crucial choices -- the opportunity to take care of each other."" Public health experts advise that thorough and frequent hand-washing, wearing masks in public meeting in small groups and maintaining at least 6 feet of social distancing can help prevent the transmission of the coronavirus.","Seniors are forming pandemic pods to ward off winter isolation (and you can, too)"

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/06/health/seniors-resilience-pandemic-trauma-wellness-partner/index.html,"Kaiser Health News Older adults are especially vulnerable physically during the coronavirus pandemic. But they're also notably resilient psychologically, calling upon a lifetime of experience and perspective to help them through difficult times. New research calls attention to this little-remarked-upon resilience as well as significant challenges for older adults as the pandemic stretches on. It shows that many seniors have changed behaviors -- reaching out to family and friends, pursuing hobbies, exercising, participating in faith communities -- as they strive to stay safe from the coronavirus. ""There are some older adults who are doing quite well during the pandemic and have actually expanded their social networks and activities,"" said Brian Carpenter, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. ""But you don't hear about them because the pandemic narrative reinforces stereotypes of older adults as frail, disabled and dependent."" Whether those coping strategies will prove effective as the pandemic lingers, however, is an open question. ""In other circumstances -- hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks -- older adults have been shown to have a lot of resilience to trauma,"" said Sarah Lowe, an assistant professor at Yale University School of Public Health, who studies the mental health effects of traumatic events. ""But Covid-19 is distinctive from other disasters because of its constellation of stressors, geographic spread and protracted duration,"" she continued. ""And older adults are now cut off from many of the social and psychological resources that enable resilience because of their heightened risk."" The most salient risk is of severe illness and death: 80% of Covid-19 deaths have occurred in people 65 and older. Here are notable findings from a new wave of research documenting the early experiences of older adults during the pandemic:  Results come from a survey of 1,272 adults age 64 and older administered online between May 4 and May 17. More than 80% of the respondents lived in New Jersey, an early pandemic hot spot. Blacks and Hispanics -- as well as seniors with lower incomes and in poor health -- were underrepresented. These seniors reported spending less face-to-face time with family and friends (95%), limiting trips to the grocery store (94%), canceling plans to attend a celebration (88%), saying no to out-of-town trips (88%), not going to funerals (72%), going to public places less often (72%) and canceling doctors' appointments (69%).  Her data comes from an online survey of 825 adults age 60 and older on March 22 and 23 -- another sample weighted toward whites and people with higher incomes. Instead of inquiring about ""coping"" -- a term that can carry negative connotations -- Whitehead asked about sources of joy and comfort during the pandemic. Most commonly reported were connecting with family and friends (31.6%), interacting on digital platforms (video chats, emails, social media, texts -- 22%), engaging in hobbies (19%), being with pets (19%), spending time with spouses or partners (15%) and relying on faith (11.5%). ""In terms of how these findings relate to where we are now, I would argue these sources of joy and comfort, these coping resources, are even more important"" as stress related to the pandemic persists, Whitehead said. Maintaining meaningful connections with older adults remains crucial, she said. ""Don't assume that people are OK,"" she advised families and friends. ""Check in with them. Ask how they're doing.""  Keep in mind, older adults expressed these attitudes at the start of the pandemic. Answers might differ now. And the longer stress endures, the more likely it is to adversely affect both physical and mental health.  Results come from an online survey of 6,938 adults age 55 and older in April and May. Researchers are following up with 4,211 respondents monthly to track changes in older adults' responses to the pandemic over a year. Among the key findings published to date: 64% of older adults said they were extremely or moderately worried about the pandemic. Thirty-two percent reported symptoms of depression, while 29% reported serious anxiety. Notably, these types of distress were about twice as common among 55- to 64-year-olds as among those 75 and older. This is consistent with research showing that people become better able to regulate their emotions and manage stress as they advance through later life. On the positive side, older adults are responding by getting exercise, going outside, altering routines, practicing self-care, and adjusting attitudes via meditation and mindfulness, among other practices, the study found. ""It's important to focus on the things we can control and recognize that we do still have agency to change things,"" said Lindsay Kobayashi, a co-author of the study and assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.  Although most reported using social media (70%) and video chats (57%) to stay connected with family and friends during the pandemic, they indicated this didn't alleviate feelings of isolation. ""What I take from this is it's important to find ways for older adults to interact face to face with other people in safe ways,"" said Dr. Preeti Malani, chief health officer at the University of Michigan. ""Back in March, April and May, Zoom family time was great. But you can't live in that virtual universe forever."" ""A lot of well-intentioned families are staying away from their parents because they don't want to expose them to risk,"" Malani continued. ""But we're at a point where risks can be mitigated, with careful planning. Masks help a lot. Social distancing is essential. Getting tested can be useful."" Malani practices what she preaches: Each weekend, she and her husband take their children to see her elderly in-laws or parents. Both couples live less than an hour away. ""We do it carefully -- outdoors, physically distant, no hugs,"" Malani said. ""But I make a point to visit with them because the harms of isolation are just too high.""",A senior's lifetime experiences help generate resilience to pandemic trauma
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/03/us/retired-nurses-covid-trnd/index.html,"CNN Juliana Morawski has realized that she most likely couldn't go back to working in an emergency room, even if she wanted to. As a retired emergency nurse of 30 years, that realization is hard for someone who just wants to lend a helping hand on the front lines. But even though she isn't in the ER, Morawski, 69, is working at an Illinois clinic, answering phones and administering She said due to her age and some minor health problems, she thinks ER managers would consider her a high risk. ""I still, honestly, feel guilty that I'm not able to help (in the ER) because they (nurses) are so burned out,"" she said. ""They're definitely getting hammered and hammered, daily."" Morawski got a first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine last week and said she's looking forward to the second dose next month. ""We're under threat, more than any other time I can remember in emergency medicine,"" Morawski told CNN's Alisyn Camerota Call to action In March, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, along with officials from Evelyn Ochoa-Celano, 63, answered that call despite having retired from nursing, three months prior. Unfortunately a few months later, she died of coronavirus herself. Ochoa-Celano retired from a city hospital in the Bronx, New York, her son, John Tabaniag told CNN, but was picking up part-time shifts at a nursing home on Long Island to stay busy. After Cuomo's letter came out, Ochoa-Celano called her son to say she was transitioning back to full-time work at the nursing home. As much as Tabaniag was proud of his mom for wanting to fight on the front lines, he was worried about her health. Having lost his stepfather and younger brother, he feared losing his mother, too. ""I don't have any kids, my mom and my wife are the only people that I have closest to me,"" he said. ""I just didn't want her to get sick."" Tabaniag described Ochoa-Celano as a strong, independent woman and said she was the first of her siblings to come to the United States from the Philippines to work as a nurse and ""put in roots for the rest of the family."" Nearly a third of the nurses who've died of ""I don't know if I was wasting my breath because in my head, no matter how scared I was, how hard I tried, if she said she was going to do something, there's almost nothing you could have done to stop her."" Ochoa-Celano got sick during the first week of April and experienced coughing and shortness of breath. Ten days later, she was hospitalized, according to Tabaniag. When she arrived at the hospital, Ochoa-Celano told him tearfully by phone, ""I don't want to die yet. I'm not ready."" For six weeks, while Ochoa-Celano was intubated, Tabiang said he clung to his phone waiting for updates from nurses about his mother's health, which rollercoastered up and down. Some days were better than others. ""You hang onto every little reaction that a person has,"" he said. ""The nurse would say she opened her eyes and looked around today and you look at that as a sign of hope, but the next day they say something else isn't looking good and it literally crushes any hope you had."" On May 13, Tabaniag got a call that his mom's health was deteriorating and made the agonizing decision to take her off assisted breathing. While cleaning out Ochoa-Celano's home, Tabaniag and his wife found the old scrubs his mother once wore to work. Instead of discarding them, Tabaniag's wife turned them into face masks as a way to show him that no matter where his mother is, she's still protecting her son. Jeopardizing your own health Like Ochoa-Celano, Mary Millard, 69, also got a request to reinstate her license. It came from the Pennsylvania Department of State Board of Nursing on December 17 - some 14 years ago after Millard retired. ""Personally, I'm not interested,"" she told CNN. ""I just feel that I've been out of nursing for too long and to go back now during a pandemic would not be a wise move."" Millard worked for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nurse for 35 years, and now lives in North Carolina. In addition to living in another state now, Millard said her age puts her in the high risk category. And the possibility that she could infect one of her loved ones is too great. ""Physically, am I up to working a 12-to-15-hour shift? I don't think so,"" she said. For others who are considering going back, Millard said she hopes they'll consider whether they're physically able to work the long hours, how their skills have aged and if they're willing to jeopardize their own health to care for others. ""We've always had to do that in nursing (jeopardize your own health),"" she said. ""Now they're saying front line workers and nurses are important and in a way it kind of upsets me because we've always been important."" As for Morawski, the retired nurse at the clinic in Illinois, she said there's still so much work that needs to be done but she's grateful that she can help where she can. And she hopes - like so many others - that things get better soon.",These former nurses were asked to leave retirement and return to the front lines
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/02/uk/2020-hurt-the-uk-2021-could-kill-it-intl-gbr/index.html,"CNN On January 2, 2020, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson The politics and constitutional arrangements between the four nations that make up the United Kingdom are a constant But the two biggest peacetime crises faced by Britain - one anticipated, and one that came out of thin air - have combined to create a perfect storm of dissatisfaction with the status quo. Finally, after years of drawn-out political debate and tortuous negotiations, Britain left the EU's regulatory and trading universe on January 1, but with a myriad of unpredictable strains on the UK's political union that could lead the British Prime Minister into choppy constitutional waters. Simultaneously, the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare how much political distance there is between the devolved governments - in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast - and London. The independence movement in Scotland has grown since the country's referendum in 2014, where Scots voted by 55% to remain in the Union. According to a Much of that support is attributed to Scotland's objection to Brexit. Even as Johnson celebrated securing a trade deal with the EU, Scotland's First Minister In Northern Ireland, nationalist politicians that spoke to CNN admitted they have never been so confident that, should a vote be called, the north could be reunited with the Republic of Ireland. While there is not a strong independence movement in Wales, the support for business-as-usual has become untenable, as nationalists become increasingly hostile towards the Conservative government in Westminster. And in England, the largest, richest and most conservative of the four, resentment of a status quo that can easily be characterized as London sending money to fund its poorer relatives in the other three nations is growing. All of which presents a problem for Boris Johnson, who is not only leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party, but also the self-appointed Minister for the Union. Indeed, ever since he took office, Johnson has painted himself as a defender of the Union and talked at length about strengthening ties between the four nations. But Unionists within his own party are skeptical as to how much the PM really cares about three countries where a majority of the electorate don't vote Conservative, and where his personal popularity ratings are poor. Worse for Johnson, 2021 is a battlefield of trip wires and landmines that he's about to wade onto with - his Unionist allies fear - the parlous tread of a hyperactive elephant. The most dangerous of these landmines is May's Scottish parliamentary election. The Scottish National Party has dominated the nation's politics since the independence vote in 2014. Though they lost the poll, by 45% to 55%, the SNP went on to win 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats in 2015. Barely a year later, they were handed another propaganda victory, when 62% of Scottish voters backed remaining in the EU against the 52% across the UK that voted to leave. Ever since, the message that Scotland is being dragged out of Europe against its will has been powerful. ""The support for independence has definitely been boosted by Brexit,"" says Nicola McEwan, professor of territorial politics at the University of Edinburgh.  ""You can expect that sentiment to grow if the Conservatives' Brexit policy leads to food shortages, an economic crash and a dwindling of the UK's status in the world."" Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also been praised by many Scots for her handling of the pandemic, even though her policies and their efficacy have seldom differed dramatically from Johnson's. McEwan thinks that this is mostly down to the fact that Sturgeon ""has fronted her government's response, giving a press conference nearly every day, whereas Boris Johnson has not been as visible."" It's not hard to see why the SNP's platform - leaving the UK and re-joining the EU under the leadership of Sturgeon - is so appealing to many north of the border. And Conservatives in England are seriously worried that Johnson doesn't have either the energy or passion needed to combat it. ""There is genuine fear that Scotland could go under this government and that there is no energy going into addressing that,"" says one MP on the government's payroll. ""We've struggled to make an emotional case for the Union. Partly that's because our focus is on our heartlands in England, but we are going to need to make a positive case beyond the economic benefits to Scotland."" If the SNP does win May's elections with independence at the core of its campaign, Johnson has two options: Carry on ignoring calls for a referendum, or try and fight the SNP. Neither option is attractive, since the only effective way to counter the SNP is to fight on their terms. ""We need to make the case that Scotland's ability to govern differently only works because of the overarching economic structure of the UK,"" says Eddie Barnes, former director of communications for the Scottish Conservatives. ""We need to end the perception that devolution is a slow drift from the Union."" Equally fraught, if less immediate a threat, is the rise in confidence among Northern Irish Republicans. Northern Ireland has long been the most likely casualty of Brexit. The province, which is part of the UK, shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is in the European Union. The prospect of a customs border separating the two has raised all sorts of concerns, ranging from the flow of goods to a return of the sectarian violence of the 1970s and 80s. In order to prevent that border, the UK government agreed with the EU to something called the Northern Ireland Protocol, which, Unionists in Northern Ireland fear, ties them to follow the EU's customs and regulatory rules rather than the UK's. ""In practical terms, it has put Northern Ireland in a different position to the rest of the UK. So, the more now Britain shifts from the EU, the more in common Northern Ireland has with the EU, and thus the Republic of Ireland,"" says Katy Hayward, professor of political sociology at Queen's University Belfast. The issue of the north becoming closer to the Republic has put a spring in the step of those who dream of reunification. ""Soft-nationalists who were pro-European - and even some soft-Unionists - have been forced to seriously rethink what Northern Ireland is and should be,"" says Matthew O'Toole, a Northern Irish lawmaker for the pro-reunification Social Democratic and Labour Party. ""People who identified as Irish had made their peace with Northern Ireland's status, in part thanks to the Good Friday Agreement,"" he explains. ""Brexit has dragged up issues that had felt settled here and put them to the top of our agenda."" The pandemic has also highlighted the political differences in the governance of Northern Ireland. The country has a power-sharing arrangement to ensure that Unionists and Republicans have an equal say in how things are run. Naturally, some have preferred that Northern Ireland follows the measures in the Republic, while others wanted to remain in lockstep with Britain. ""We've had unhappy compromise after unhappy compromise, which probably summarises the politics of Northern Ireland,"" says Hayward. ""No one has got exactly what they want. It's exacerbated tensions that were always there and it's unlikely to stop being so fraught in 2021."" 2021 was supposed to be the year in which Northern Ireland celebrated its centenary. Instead, its citizens are likely to be more divided than they have been for years. Mercifully for Johnson, the situation is less perilous in Wales, where there isn't a serious separatist movement. However, since Johnson faces the prospect of fighting in Scotland and Northern Ireland, he risks overlooking Wales. ""Covid has highlighted what devolution actually means, in terms of Welsh politicians being able to make independent policy that directly affects Welsh people,"" says Roger Awan-Scully, professor of politics at Cardiff University. One error Johnson could make is that, in order to appeal to his base in England, he goes on the offensive against political leaders who are anti-Conservative - meaning Wales's hostile Labour leadership could be a target. ""If Conservatives take a more aggressive line against devolution and pro-centralised control from London, it risks emboldening the anti-Westminster movement in Wales,"" Awan-Scully adds. The final piece in this puzzle, of course, is Johnson's base in England. The Conservatives won a majority in 2019 by taking a string of Brexit-supporting Labour seats in the north of England. The party's heartlands in the south also voted heavily in favor of Brexit. ""When we eventually leave the EU proper, this government will need a new enemy, and the obvious choice is Scotland and to a lesser extent Wales,"" says Rob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester. ""Many English Conservatives don't really care about the Union. They see the other countries as annoyances that are bankrolled by England."" 2021 is going to be a difficult year for all four nations of the UK. And the Prime Minister, who likes to wrap himself in the Union flag, might be tempted to keep his head down and ignore the separatist screams. But if Johnson is unable to make leaving the EU look like a success and he alienates the public in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, it's inevitable that more and more voters will wonder if the grass is greener outside of the United Kingdom.",2020 stretched the social fabric of the United Kingdom. 2021 could rip it to pieces
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/19/health/how-to-be-patient-benefits-wellness/index.html,"CNN When the elevator's running slow, you clench your teeth and curse under your breath. If you still haven't received your latte or a restaurant table, you snap at the barista or hostess and demand to know why it's taking so long. Everyone has those moments where they run short on the ability to stay calm in the face of frustration, adversity or suffering, also known as patience. ""We have expectations of what should be and what is an appropriate time to wait in line, or how quickly I should be able to get somewhere, or how someone else should act or how I should feel,"" said Sarah Schnitker, an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University, and author of the 2012 study "" ""When those expectations are violated, oftentimes that's when our emotions become dysregulated,"" Schnitker said. Impatience isn't always bad, but people who are chronically impatient can experience more stress, which increases their risk of health problems such as cardiovascular issues, Schnitker said. Some people are more patient than others, but we're not ""doomed to whatever kind of natural setpoint of patience we have,"" Schnitker told CNN. ""With intentional practices, we can cultivate our patience, and make it easier for ourselves to wait."" Here are some of Schnitker's recommendations for developing more patience.    Sometimes impatience helps us focus our attention and prepares us for action. But when it's a situation that you can't control or there isn't a lot you can do, changing your own emotions is the option you have - basically down-regulating them and bringing yourself back to a state of calm.   Another step I like to talk about is connecting your suffering, waiting or trouble with your bigger purpose or life goals. Is there meaning in what you're going through? How can you tap into that meaning as a resource to help you cope with this negativity in the moment? We've done studies looking at the virtue of patience in psychiatric inpatients hospitalized for suicide risk or other psychiatric disorders. We found even among that population, those who were more patient were able to deal with crises more effectively. They also see a decrease in depression symptoms. It's something that even in acute instances of suffering, patience can help with a person's recovery. Practicing patience might be hard in the heat of the moment. Imagine you're dealing with your child who's having a tantrum, waiting to hear breast biopsy results or stuck in traffic before a really important meeting - you can try to use these tips in the moment. But for creating habits, what research suggests is effective is practicing these strategies during times that aren't quite as stressful, or more minor things throughout the day. Try to be patient when the elevator comes too slowly. That way, you've got some skills built up by the time you get to a more high-stakes situation. Talking about your efforts with others can be really helpful. It's better to train rather than try. Regularly practicing meditation or just being more mindful are also correlated with higher patience. You can also build your patience by increasing your emotional fluency, which is the ability to recognize and name your emotions. Emotional fluency makes it easier to reappraise situations when you're in the moment or afterward. If you change the way you think, that changes how you feel - but first you need to know what you feel.   Thinking about what you're trying to teach them long term can help you in the moment - saying, ""OK, this is part of teaching discipline and self-control, and helping them become an adult who is kind and contributes to society. There's some meaning why I'm putting up with the screaming and using positive parenting practices."" In the context of a romantic relationship or marriage, consider what it is you're building instead of just focusing on the negative instances. Fill up the positive side that motivates you to stick with your patience during struggles.   Research shows that people who are more patient have higher well-being - more life satisfaction, hope, self-esteem, positive emotions in general. They seem to be able to pursue their goals with greater effort and have more satisfaction with their goal progress. Patients with higher patience tend to have fewer health symptoms such as headaches, ulcers, diarrhea and more.   You also have to be patient with yourself. Be compassionate and kind toward your own development, and know that this isn't something you can change overnight. It can be cultivated, but it's not a quick fix.",How to become more patient with everyday annoyances
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/07/politics/operation-warp-speed-vaccine-distribution-executive-order/index.html,"CNN  The signing is slated to take place during a vaccine summit at the White House, with the hope that the order will allay fears that there will not be enough doses of the vaccine to go around after distribution begins. White House officials described the order as a ""reaffirmation of the President's commitment to America first."" But on a call with reporters Monday evening, in which administration officials asked not to be identified publicly, the White House did not provide specifics on how the order will do that. The order comes after On the Monday evening call, Trump administration officials denied they had turned down an opportunity to buy more doses of the Pfizer vaccine months ago. One senior administration official said the administration is ""in the middle of a negotiation right now"" and can't speak publicly about the Pfizer talks. ""But we feel absolutely confident"" that there will be a ""sufficient number of doses to vaccinate all Americans who desire one before the end of the second quarter of 2021,"" the official said. The initial US contract, an advance purchase agreement with Pfizer, was signed on July 22, the administration official said. That agreement was for 100 million doses with the option to purchase more. The 100 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 50 million people, because it's a two-dose vaccine. The administration official said on Monday's call that they are continuing to negotiate with several companies working on Covid-19 vaccines. The US has the opportunity to purchase 3 billion doses of vaccine, among all the contracts the federal government currently has with various companies. That would in theory be enough to vaccinate the US population several times over. Pfizer would not disclose whether a deal for additional doses for the US had fallen through or if any additional orders would be unable to be fulfilled until the summer. ""(The) U.S. government placed an initial order of 100 million doses for Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine and Pfizer is ready to begin shipping initial doses soon after receiving an Emergency Use Authorization from FDA,"" the company said in a statement. ""Any additional doses beyond the 100 million are subject to a separate and mutually-acceptable agreement. The company is not able to comment on any confidential discussions that may be taking place with the U.S. government."" Administration officials on Monday evening's call also confirmed that representatives for Pfizer and Moderna will not attend Tuesday's White House summit, despite being the companies behind the coronavirus vaccines seeking emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. White House officials said representatives for the companies won't be there ""because the administration felt it was more important for regulators to attend and explain the authorization process to the American people. "" Both companies were involved with ""initial discussions"" of the planning of the summit, but ""there was a change of direction in light of the fact we would have the regulator participating in the event,"" an official said.

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/02/health/kids-mental-health-transition-wellness/index.html,"CNN I tapped gently on the driver's window while my toddler pressed his back to the passenger door inside the car. ""I don't want to go!"" he wailed. We were just over a week into day care drop-off, and the excitement of new people and spaces had worn off. A disorienting world of masks and unrecognizable faces was sinking in. For the past 14 months as the pandemic raged, Long before the Covid-19 vaccine took full effect in the grown-ups, we'd been Now here we were and, despite feverish research and counseling support, I was in a day care parking lot, grasping at straws. We had watched Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, advise the United States on the pandemic. But as Nikki Raymond, CEO of behavioral health and family preservation service provider Surely there were other families now trying to help their kids adjust to the transition to reopening as vaccines became more widely available in the United States. Here's what health and education experts said about managing your kids' mental health while expanding their once limited circles. Can our kids return to in-person learning? When ""Quiet the noise, focus on who you trust and be honest about your comfort levels and family's needs,"" said Erica Fener-Sitkoff, clinical psychologist and executive director of For starters, avoid comparing your options to other families' options. Lean on trusted sources for decision-making, whether it's your kid's pediatrician, your own doctors (if you're an immunocompromised adult), the Next, identify your boundaries. Be honest about what you're comfortable with and what you're not ready for yet. Write it down, come back to it, and make changes when you need to. Keeping a log will provide a clear reference and help instill confidence in what you decide, Fener-Sitkoff said. Talk to your kids Whether you have toddlers, tweens or teenagers, have age-appropriate conversations about the coming changes and how you can tackle them together. Begin by acknowledging how you have supported each other alongside the deep losses. Talk about the boundaries you previously set to keep the family safe, how they are changing and why. For example, discuss shifting from not interacting with anyone outside the household to going to a camp with Covid safety protocols. Explain that additional changes will come as we learn more about the virus or as more people get vaccinated -- or not -- and that you'll continue to talk as a family about those changes. And be sure to communicate what you can all still do to stay safe, Fener-Sitkoff said. Answering your children's questions transparently and checking in often about their experiences during the transition are key to helping them feel more secure in the decisions you're making, even if peers' families are doing things differently. Come up with potential scenarios they may face, like being around others who are unmasked indoors if the family rule is to wear masks, and how your kids might respond, Fener-Sitkoff noted. Also encourage kids to talk to others they feel safe with, whether it's a friend, extended family member or support staff at school or camp. Lower expectations for older kids All kids need time to adjust to a new routine, said Maia Smith, longtime school social worker with Fulton County in Georgia, but parents of teens need to be extra mindful to respond to their struggles with empathy rather than punishment or restrictions. That's because parents tend to have higher expectations of older kids. Hit pause on that. Now is the time for grace and keeping the lines of communication open, even if your teen resists, Fener-Sitkoff said. That could look like pulling your teenager out of their room to talk about friendships, feelings and school activities over a meal, Smith said. When parents Start with small group activities Ease kids into social gatherings with one-on-one time with a good friend or a small group of friends, said Cindy Simpson, CHRIS 180's chief operating officer. In my household, we went to the playground and saw a couple of friends from vaccinated families outdoors. A week before my toddler went back to day care, he met his new classmates and teachers during outdoor play at school, so he wasn't completely unfamiliar on his first day. Watch out for sensory processing issues. Kids who have had limited contact with others may be overstimulated in big groups or noisy spaces. Keep a pair of headphones on hand, Walters said. Kids who have spent most of their time at home may have challenges adjusting to environmental temperature shifts, like getting uncomfortably cold in air-conditioned classrooms. ""Could it also be nerves? Maybe,"" Walters said. But it doesn't take much to be prepared with a pair of mittens indoors, even in the summer. Create routine and rituals Many younger kids - like my 3-year-old - go through separation anxiety during any transition, Fener-Sitkoff noted. You can develop a new routine to reset their sense of stability, security and confidence in their new environment. The more predictable the routine, the more in control they feel. Develop see-you-later and welcome-home rituals, simple ways of saying goodbye and celebrating being back together at day's end. A forehead kiss. A high five. And try to connect screen-free every day for at least 30 minutes. When either parent picks up our toddler from day care, we take a small treat and chat about his day while he nibbles away, reveling in the solo attention. Just before I drop my 8-year-old off to spend time with her grandparents, I will kiss her palm, curl her fingers around it, put it to her heart and promise that's where I'll be if she misses us. We also came up with a safe word she could use with me if she wasn't feeling OK and didn't know how to express it. It's become a catchall word for how we're feeling in the moment. ""Kids remember the little things,"" Fener-Sitkoff said. ""They don't cost anything, but they are heartfelt."" Leverage your child's school community With more school districts putting mental health supports in place, teachers, principals or school counselors are good entry points to accessible help. ""It's important to communicate concerns you have about your child returning,"" said Smith, the school social worker. ""Teachers want to help and they recognize that this is a difficult time."" Encourage your school staff to look out for and talk to you about social and emotional gaps they might observe in your child, and ask how teachers are supported in recognizing signs of trauma and how kids will be directed. For mental health services, local children's hospital systems, health insurance member services, Think beyond therapy to activities that foster enrichment and belonging like the The pandemic is far from over, and while we can't fully predict its impact on our kids' mental health, we can support them and hope that our best efforts are enough.",Many kids are struggling as they come out of pandemic isolation.

Listening to your favorite music while walking can really elevate your mood and lift your spirits, too. Make a walk a daily activity, even if it's just for 10 minutes. If you wish, you can increase it by five minutes each week. If you live in a busy city, try to do it when the streets are less crowded. And if you are living in an apartment and don't wish to go outside, try walking the halls or stairwells. Find a fitness class that inspires you For me, that's ballet.

I've been loving oatmeal with low-fat milk and berries lately, though Greek yogurt with berries is my typical go-to. Whatever you decide to eat for breakfast, Enjoy a vegetable with each meal Vegetables are loaded with healthful antioxidants and fiber, which keeps you feeling full without contributing calories. They can also take the place of unhealthy carbs like french fries or creamy pasta. Vegetables don't have to be boring. In my house, we enjoy roasted butternut squash and Brussels sprouts, roasted spaghetti squash (a fun substitute for pasta) and roasted radishes when they're in season. My daughters also enjoy broccoli sauteed in a little bit of olive oil, and asparagus tossed with Parmesan. Once you get used to eating vegetables, you can slowly transition to giving them more real estate on your plate. I typically recommend filling half of your plate with veggies. Pick two fun fruits to enjoy each day Like vegetables, fruits are loaded with antioxidants and fiber - and deliver sweetness without excess sugar. A handful of blueberries or raspberries, a banana, cut-up melon or a clementine can all count toward your daily fruit goals. Like vegetables, fruits don't have to be boring - you can try a fruit-focused dessert. Try out my recipes for Find your fiber fix Yes, fiber makes you feel full, but I've talked about fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, but for other fiber-boosting strategies, try sprinkling fiber-rich chia seeds or Fiber One on top of your favorite cereal or yogurt.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/30/health/operation-warp-speed-moncef-slaoui/index.html,"CNN The head of the government's effort to develop a vaccine against Covid-19 says he expects the vaccine to have efficacy rates ""in the 90%"" range - but that there might not be enough vaccine available for all Americans until the end of next year. ""I think it will be a very effective vaccine. That's my prediction,"" said Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed. ""My personal opinion based on my experience and the biology of this virus, I think this vaccine is going to be highly efficacious. I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the 90% [range]."" Slaoui, an immunologist, formerly headed up the vaccine program at GlaxoSmithKline, where he led the development of five major novel vaccines. He said there would be enough vaccine for all Americans ""ideally"" by the middle of 2021, but possibly not until the end of 2021. Slaoui spoke Thursday with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen while touring a Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial site in Savannah, Georgia. It was his first television interview since joining Operation Warp Speed in May. When will there be a vaccine for everyone? In June, Dr. Anthony Fauci ""The best we've ever done is measles, which is 97 to 98 percent effective,"" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. ""That would be wonderful if we get there. I don't think we will. I would settle for [a] 70, 75% effective vaccine."" The US Food and Drug Administration has set an even lower standard for a Covid-19 vaccine, stating in Vaccines have various effectiveness rates. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a full round of polio vaccines is 99% to 100% effective; full vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis is 80-90% effective, while the flu shot is 40-60% effective. Slaoui added that with a Covid-19 vaccine, ""it's possible that we will need a booster"" after initial vaccination ""every year or every two years or every three years."" Slaoui said he expects ""to probably have a few tens of millions of doses"" of vaccine in December of this year or January of next year, and those would go to high-risk individuals because ""we will not have doses for the full US population on day one."" High-risk individuals include the elderly and those with underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Slaoui said he's ""optimistic"" there will be vaccines for all Americans by the end of 2021, but ideally by the middle of 2021. ""That's our objective,"" he said. Vaccine trials moving at record pace Operation Warp Speed is funding eight vaccines, Slaoui said. Five of those are already in Phase 3 clinical trials or will be starting by the end of September, he said. A Phase 3 trial is the last round of tests before a vaccine goes before regulators, and may be put on the market. The Covid-19 vaccine Phase 3 trials will each involve 30,000 study subjects. ""They are all different vaccines. They are actually going very fast,"" Slaoui said, noting that the virus was identified just six months ago. ""I've been doing this for 30 years, and the fastest thing that I ever can remember that went from discovery to Phase Three trials was in four years."" Vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer are in Phase 3 in the United States, and a vaccine by AstraZeneca is in Phase 3 trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa. Phase 3 trials for that vaccine are expected to start in August in the US. Phase 3 trials for vaccines made by two other companies - Johnson & Johnson and Novavax - are scheduled to begin in September, he added. On Friday, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline announced they're receiving Operation Warp Speed funding, and expect to start a Phase 3 trial by the end of the year. Slaoui did not name the other two vaccines that will receive federal funding.","Operation Warp Speed leader says he expects coronavirus vaccine to be highly effective, 'in the 90%' range"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/10/health/weed-false-memories-wellness/index.html,"CNN You're on a train chatting with a friend sitting across from you, both of you are high from smoking marijuana. Suddenly you see a fight break out on the platform below. A security guard is in a tussle with a man who is kicking him. After the man is subdued and removed from the scene, your companion excitedly tells you what they saw, only to add a detail you don't recall: There was a police dog on the scene. Would your memories then include a dog as part of the fight? Mostly likely yes, especially if you're high. A A false memory is a recollection of something that didn't occur or a memory that is different from the way it actually happened, often triggered by suggestions from others. ""We are all prone to the formation of false memories, independent of cannabis use,"" Ramaekers said. ""The susceptibility for false memory, however, increases with cannabis. Under cannabis, users can easily accept fake truths for true memory."" A potential impact Why does this matter? With state after state considering legalizing marijuana, a rise in false memories could play an increasingly larger role in criminal matters, said co-author Elizabeth Loftus, a professor of psychological science in the department of criminology at the University of California, Irvine. ""This new work is suggesting authorities need to be extra careful when interviewing somebody,"" Loftus said. They should consider removing ""them from a situation where they might be exposed to suggestive information that could contaminate their memory."" And there's the possible creation of false memories that affect friends, family and work colleagues. ""Formation of false memories may alter the interpretation of work-related activities and social interactions with others,"" Ramaekers said. ""There are lots of situations where somebody's memory matters,"" Loftus said. ""For example, a family dispute such as two siblings arguing about what happened in the past over a Thanksgiving table."" Creating a false memory ""It's very easy to distort memory for the details of an event,"" said Loftus, who discovered the psychological concept called the ""misinformation effect"" and has testified or consulted in such major trials such as O.J. Simpson, Ted Bundy and the Menendez brothers. In numerous studies over decades, Loftus has shown that when witnesses are given misinformation about something they saw, such as a mistake in the details, they will remember things that were only suggested to them after the event was completely over. In the 1990s, she began to explore if it was possible to implant entirely false memories. ""It's one thing to make people think the perpetrator had a brown jacket instead of a green jacket, but could you plant entirely false 'rich' memories into the mind for something that didn't happen?"" Loftus asked. ""In one of the first studies done on this [subject], we made people remember that they were lost in a shopping mall as a child and had to be rescued and reunited with their family even though it never happened,"" she said. Other researchers went so far as to implant memories of being ""attacked by a vicious animal as a child; having a serious indoor or outdoor accident as a child; even witnessing somebody being demonically possessed,"" Loftus said. Could this happen to us all the time? Not likely, Loftus said. ""It's very easy to distort memory for the details of an event,"" she said. ""It takes a lot more effort to plant one of these rich false memories."" Do real memories come back? In addition to witnessing the virtual train platform fight, subjects in the current experiment also underwent a first-person virtual reality scenario in which they became a student in need of money who steals a purse. In a third experiment, they were asked to recall words they had never been given. ""This study showed that cannabis increased the number of false memories across all three memory paradigms,"" Ramaekers said. While science isn't completely sure why, researchers suspect that cannabis activates receptors in the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain, possibly producing ""fragmentation of thought, loosening of associations and heightened distractibility,"" he said. However, when asked to recall the words or events a week later, the study found no real difference between cannabis users and the control group. They were able to recall the events as they actually occurred. ""The findings suggest that investigative interviewers should minimize the questioning of cannabis-intoxicated eyewitnesses and suspects, and instead wait until the first possible time after sobriety is reached,"" Ramaekers said. The same advice might apply to family and friends, especially for habitual users of weed. There is evidence ""that chronic use of cannabis can produce persisting decline of cognitive [or] memory function, even after prolonged abstinence and no THC in blood,"" Ramaekers said.","Don't trust your memories if you're high on weed, study says"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/04/us/vaccine-distrust-black-and-latino-americans/index.html,"CNN When a Covid-19 vaccine becomes widely available to Americans, Joe Cunningham says he won't be taking it. ""I don't know, I don't understand it,"" the 85-year-old said. ""I'd like to know where it's coming from."" Cunningham, who lives in Hobson City, AL, is among the Black Americans who have little faith in doctors and Covid-19 vaccines recently developed by pharmaceutical companies. Alabama is taking a beating from the coronavirus, with the state's 14-day positivity rate just over 29%. In Calhoun County, where Hobson City sits, the rate is 37%. Still, older residents like Cunningham are reluctant to take a Covid-19 test. The town, located about 100 miles from Tuskegee, is home to one of the America's history of racism in medical research and a lack of trust in the federal government is making some Black Americans and Latinos hesitant to take the vaccine. Health and community leaders fear that vaccine hesitancy could result in some Black and Latino Americans not being vaccinated as Covid-19 continues to batter their communities at disproportionate rates. On Monday, But a study released by the Latino Americans, however, were more optimistic with 34% saying they trust the vaccine will be safe and 40% believing it will be effective. Much of their hesitancy stems from distrust in the federal government and the nation's history of racism in medical research and healthcare, the study found. Carlton Gordon also says he won't immediately take the vaccine. Gordon, a Black father who lives outside of Chicago, says he is concerned the vaccine is being rushed to the market and that not enough Black people have been tested to know if it's safe. ""I would rather not try to pivot toward a vaccine that frankly is not quite proven,"" said Gordon, 34. ""If this vaccine is proven effective after it's been released more broadly to people, then we can certainly value it and I might change my perspective."" Building trust around the vaccine will require a concerted effort by Black and Latino doctors, researchers, activists and elected officials, said Renee Mahaffey Harris, president and CEO of the People of color, she said, are more likely to trust leaders who look like them rather than officials from the Communities should start planning information campaigns and town halls to discuss how and why the vaccine works, Harris said. ""It must be a Black person talking to a Black person,"" Harris said. ""You're not going to all of a sudden trust a group of people that you have mistrusted just because the science says this."" A fear of being 'guinea pigs' Ernest Grant, the president of the American Nurses Association, participated in a vaccine trial this fall with hopes that it would combat fears in the Black community around taking the vaccine. Grant, who is Black, said he took the two required doses of the vaccine -- the first Sept. 9 and the second Oct. 5 -- and experienced mild side effects such as fatigue and chills. Although the trial is double-blinded, meaning researchers and participants don't know who is actually getting the real vaccine or the placebo, Grant said he is confident the vaccine is safe. He recommends other Black leaders take the vaccine so they can share their experience and knowledge with the community. ""I feel confident that once it is released to the public there should not be hesitancy about taking the vaccine,"" Grant said. ""At some point there's always that potential that it (Covid-19) could happen to you and if I know there is a cure that could potentially save me from that, I think I would go for the cure."" Yet, it's still difficult for some Black people to trust because of racial bias from healthcare providers. Carmen Bailey, of Cleveland, Ohio, suburb of Oakwood Village, said she was diagnosed with Covid-19 in April and has avoided medical help because doctors have treated her poorly in the past. Bailey, who still suffers Covid-19 side effects with her heart, lungs and kidneys, said she refuses to take the vaccine. ""We don't know the side effects,"" said Bailey, 52. ""I just really feel like at this point ... people that's going to take that vaccine are guinea pigs."" History has left a dark cloud for some Black people. The Black people who were enslaved were also historically used by doctors to test medications and surgeries that caused health complications or death. The racist history in medical research prevented pharmaceutical companies from Nearly 40% of reported Covid-19 cases have been Black and Latino people, However, Still, Black physicians have rallied around the vaccine in recent weeks. Last month, the Black Coalition Against COVID published a ""Love Letter to Back America"" signed by eight prominent Black doctors that encouraged Black people to participate in the vaccine trials and take the vaccine once it is proven safe. ""We know that our collective role in helping to create a vaccine that works for Black people--and that we trust -- has an impact on our very survival,"" the doctors wrote. Black pastors have also united to share information about the vaccine. Rev. Horace Sheffield of Detroit said he joined six leading pastors -- including Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Raphael Warnock -- from churches across the country to launch Sheffield said he is willing to be one of the first Black people to take the vaccine when it's released. ""We've got a great job to do to convince people to take the vaccine,"" Sheffield said. ""And the only people who can carry that message is us (Black leaders)."" Black leaders in New York, including Sharpton, launched a task force this week to address Covid-19 vaccine delivery to the Black community and concerns about the vaccine's safety. In the Latino community, many won't take the vaccine because of their distrust in the federal government, activists say. President Donald Trump's administration's anti-immigration policies, public charge rules that create barriers to citizenship and threats to the Affordable Care Act have made some Latino families reluctant to receive healthcare, said Rita Carreon, vice president of the health for Lack of access is the other half of the battle Carreon said Latino Americans will be looking to their trusted leaders and organizations for information on vaccine trial data, side effects, and where they can safely get the vaccine in their neighborhood if they are uninsured. ""Historically, there has not been significant outreach in the community to help them feel confident in the healthcare system,"" Carreon said. ""We want to make sure information is communicated in plain, simple, and clear terms."" But gaining the confidence of Black and Latino Americans is half the battle. Many people of color living in poor and urban neighborhoods don't have doctors or healthcare facilities near their homes. They also lack transportation. CDC advisers Existing clinics in urban centers such as Chicago and Atlanta worry they won't have the resources to reach every patient once the vaccine is rolled out to the general public. Earlier this year, some ran out of personal protective equipment and Covid-19 tests.  Willding said her clinic isn't equipped for the community outreach, vaccine storage and other logistics needed to get two doses of the vaccine to every patient. She also worries that her patients, particularly single parents and essential workers, won't be able to get their families to the clinic twice. ""Covid-19 has put a spotlight on something that safety net healthcare providers have always known and that is the inequity in healthcare access,"" Willding said. ""When we talk about an equitable approach to vaccine distribution, free and charitable health centers need to be factored into that approach."" Breanna Lathrop, who heads Good Samaritan Health Center in Atlanta, is in the same boat. Lathrop said she needs funding for syringes and needles. She also needs help convincing patients that the vaccine is safe and necessary. ""I think people are going into this already feeling a little scared and overwhelmed,"" Lathrop said. ""We talk about their questions and we want them to feel comfortable. But when you're talking about suddenly vaccinating hundreds of people, I can't sit with hundreds of people and have that conversation.""",Some Black and Latino Americans are still hesitant to take the vaccine.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/03/us/california-latinos-jenny-ruelas-covid-19/index.html,"CNN Every step for Jenny Ruelas is a challenge. The 31-year-old has to pause to catch her breath, carries a can of oxygen with her wherever she goes, and walks with a cane - all of this since she contracted Covid-19 in May. Her doctors told her that one side of her heart is now larger than the other, she says, but her heart is also broken after losing her father to the virus. His girlfriend also died, leaving their five young children without parents. ""I have no balance in my body,"" Ruelas told CNN. ""It's hard for me to breathe, I can't walk for too long without running out of breath. I have to constantly check my oxygen - something I would never even think of before. It sometimes drops so low, I feel like I'm breathing through a straw. Now I even have trouble sleeping. That was never an issue before. I just can't do anything without help."" Ruelas' experience mirrors that of many other Latinos across the US, who have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus. According to Johns Hopkins University, racial and ethnic information is only available for about 35% of all deaths in the United States, but even in that small percentage it is evident that Latinx Americans are unevenly impacted by the coronavirus in some regions. In fact, across the West, Latinos are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. People who identify as Latinx are four times more likely to be hospitalized than White people, In California, Latinos represent 60% of Covid cases and nearly 50% of deaths through August, according to the Los Angeles County, where Ruelas lives, has the highest number of cases and deaths.  Again, the majority are Latinos. Latinos are 'significant portion' of essential workforce In every county in the state, Latinos are the most severely impacted by the virus, said Dr. Gil Chavez, an epidemiologist and co-chair of California's Covid-19 testing task force - a position that pulled him back to work two months into his retirement. ""Latinos have some of the known factors for having really increased cases and having more bad cases than other members of the population,"" Dr. Chavez told CNN. ""We have very high rates of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and some of the immunocompromised conditions (like) obesity (and) smoking."" These trends highlight historical issues for Latinos, not just in California but nationwide, such as social disparities in terms of financial opportunities, health care access and utilization. In late July, the Kaiser Family Foundation ""The shifting surge in outbreaks to the South and West will likely exacerbate the disparate effects of COVID-19 for people of color,"" KFF wrote in its report. ""Hispanic people may be particularly hard hit as outbreaks rise in these areas."" Many of the jobs Latinos have in California don't allow for flexible schedules or for the work to be done from home, Dr. Chavez said, which also contributes to the high contraction rates. ""Latinos make really a very significant portion of what we would call the essential workforce,""  Dr. Chavez said. ""Latinos are heavily represented in many industries that provide vital services from growing food, to producing food, to working as support staff in hospitals/healthcare facilities, driving trucks and cars. Many of those occupations really put people in increased risk of exposure for Covid-19."" This is most clearly evident in the agriculturally rich Central Valley of the state where at one point this summer, the positivity rate in the region soared to about 18%, prompting California Gov. Gavin Newsom to send in three support teams to provide clear messaging in English and Spanish. Newsom said he sent the teams to eight of the hardest hit counties in the region - San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings and Tulare, and Kern counties. ""There are certain parts of the state, certain regions, and certain sectors that are disproportionately impacted by the transmission of this virus,"" the governor said in a July press conference. The support teams  are boosting testing and contact tracing efforts in alliance with social services support. That includes food and shelter for people who can't go to work because they need to quarantine or isolate while sick with the virus or after exposure to someone who did test positive. The positivity rate has since dropped in the region, but is still about double that of the statewide positivity rate which is currently around 6%, according to state data. The California Farmworker Foundation is also now offering free testing at work sites making it more likely that hourly workers will participate. Dr. Chavez said a lack of trust in authorities may also be a hindrance to the fight to control the virus in certain communities. ""People may not be going out to get tested,"" he said. ""People may not take care of their sickness so when they go get care, they may actually have waited too long."" Underlying health issues, coupled with Latinos' higher exposure to the virus, often make for a more intense battle with the illness - meaning the possibility of a more severe case. How Covid quickly spread in one household Ruelas lived with her 60-year-old father Humberto Ruelas, his 38-year-old girlfriend Karina Bonilla, and their five children, ages two to 17, in South Los Angeles. Bonilla was the first to get sick. ""She used to work for a fruit vendor and her boss ... he was positive with Covid,"" Ruelas said. Within a couple of days, Ruelas said, Humberto was also sick. ""He did go to the hospital three times. The first one, he was negative for Covid but he did have pneumonia. Then the second time, that's when he found out he was positive for Covid. And the third time, that was his final stay. He didn't come back."" At this point, Ruelas, who worked with adults with developmental disabilities, was still going to her job so she wasn't at home as much. When her schedule shifted, she ended up spending more time with her family. ""I got sick right away but the thing about me is that I didn't know about my dad's girlfriend and her boss having Covid,"" she said. Ruelas said she was unable to breath, walk or even ""make it to the bathroom."" Over-the-counter medication wasn't working, and she kept feeling chest pain. Meanwhile, Humberto was also in bad shape. ""He couldn't really talk. He couldn't move much,"" Ruelas said. But it never crossed Ruelas' mind that she could have the coronavirus, because she took all the necessary precautions. ""When I came back from work, I would disinfect myself, change my clothes - constantly washing my hands, always wore a mask,"" she said. ""I didn't even go into stores and I had my food delivered. So, I knew it couldn't be me."" One day, one of her younger brothers came to her room and she told him that she felt like she was dying. ""And he looks at me and he's like, 'You probably have Covid like my mom,'"" Ruelas said. ""I felt the whole world just kind of fell on me."" She immediately called her boss to inform him that someone in her home had tested positive for the virus and that she would not come back to work until she got tested. Her sister confirmed with their father that Bonilla had Covid. Ruelas drove herself to the hospital and was immediately admitted. She tested positive for Covid-19 and was placed in an isolation room. Within days of Jenny, her dad and Bonilla were admitted together to the same hospital. ""I only remember maybe four days out of the 11 days that I was there,"" she said, noting it was after she was moved out of the emergency room when she spoke to her father again. ""He couldn't say much. Our conversation was like 26 seconds,"" Ruelas said. ""He just said, 'I just need you to be okay.'"" But it was difficult for Ruelas to talk. ""It was hard to have any reaction without my oxygen dropping, without me feeling like my heart was gonna come out my chest. It was even hard to cry."" Nurses were having a hard time controlling Ruelas' temperature, so they surrounded her with ice packs. ""I started getting weird rashes around my body and I had a fever. I had a headache. I did have weakness. For two days, I couldn't walk or move. It would burn to open my eyes,"" Ruelas said. ""Definitely chest pain all the time and pain in my back, which was my lungs. I did have loss of taste and smell. I definitely couldn't eat. I would vomit."" As she fought the virus herself, Ruelas was getting indications from doctors that her father, who was in the room right next to hers, wasn't doing well. ""I felt him close even though he couldn't talk to me right away. I said there's only a wall dividing us. I can talk to him,"" Ruelas said. The next day, her sister arranged a video chat for Ruelas to see their dad. But it was hard for her to see their father, face down and on a ventilator, not responding. The doctors weren't giving their father more than 24 hours to live. Ruelas could barely move but she realized while she was in the bathroom, she could hear the nurses and doctors in her father's room. That meant they could hear her - her father might hear her. ""I hit the wall. I was like, 'Dad, don't do this to me. Don't,"" Ruelas said through tears. The medical workers had tried to let her see her dad one last time before he died, but she and her sister didn't make it in time. Within minutes, her father was gone. ""Even though he had passed already, his facial expressions - you can see the pain,"" she said, sobbing. ""He was in a lot of pain and that's the face I won't ever forget."" Within eight hours of Humberto's death, his girlfriend also died - the same day that Ruelas was discharged from the hospital. A long recovery Ruelas no longer tests positive for the virus, but she definitely hasn't recovered. While she was in the hospital, she said she had a stroke. Besides all of her other health problems, she also now has trouble remembering things. Besides the three family members who contracted the coronavirus, Ruelas' 12-year old sister also tested positive but was asymptomatic. She has also since recovered. Now Ruelas lives in the house alone - the house that used to be vibrant and full of voices - and her younger siblings, having lost both of their parents, are now staying with Ruelas' older sister. ""You know the things you thought once were annoying? Why can't we just have peace and quiet?"" Ruelas said. ""Like now that I have peace and quiet, I miss that."" She also misses her father, who she described as loud and funny. ""It's not easy waking up and not hearing a thing, not hearing him because one thing about my Dad, when he got to the house, everybody knew he was home,"" Ruelas said, admitting she struggles with his absence as she passes his room. ""I have to do a reality check. He's not going to come out of there anymore. Out of respect, the doors are still closed. Everything is still there."" She said she was once in the shoes of those who didn't believe the virus could hit as hard as it did. But now she knows otherwise. ""You haven't been in the hospital,"" she said. ""You haven't heard everything I've heard. You haven't experienced the pain. It's painful having severe Covid. It's really painful and it can happen to anyone. Today it was me. Tomorrow, it can be absolutely anyone.""",Why Latinos in California are being hit hard by Covid-19

Meda began the job in August. But on November 14, just a few months later, Meda died of Covid-19, according to Meda-Schlamel. Collin College requires that all students, faculty, staff, contractors and visitors wear face coverings while in all public areas, according to the schools ""She felt like she could be of service not on the front lines, but in classroom not realizing that that was still the front lines,"" Meda-Schlamel said. ""She was the anchor of the family and the anchor is gone now."" Collin College's District President Neil Matkin shared the news of Meda's passing in an email to the faculty.

Kirk Dickey, Collin College's Marketing and Communications Coordinator, confirmed the contents of the email in a statement to CNN. Meda-Schlamel said she got to say goodbye to her mother in the hospital, where she entered her mother's room wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent catching the virus herself.

""It was very clear that (her body) was just a vessel and to think that anyone comes back from that is amazing because it (the virus) ravaged her so quickly.""

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/31/business/being-a-jerk-doesnt-advance-career-wellness/index.html,"CNN When we're young and preparing to enter the workforce, we're trained to set aside our innocent, wide-eyed hope for the tough skills needed in a dog-eat-dog world. Sure, being assertive and developing a thick skin may serve you well, but adopting a mindset where you're just out for yourself, it turns out, might be good for nothing. People who tend to be hostile, deceptive and manipulative for their own gain, while ignoring others' concerns and welfare, might not attain any greater power in the workplace than people who are both dominant and sociable, according to a Whether people who are aggressive, scheming and selfish when they begin their career are more likely to become powerful than agreeable people is an age-old question that ""has long captivated philosophers, scholars and laypeople alike,"" the study said. Yet prior research hadn't given us a definite answer until now. Why we look up to jerks ""Many people believe that nice guys finish last,"" said the study's lead author Cameron Anderson, a professor of organizational behavior at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. The culturally persistent myth, the researchers found, has blinded us to the reality that there are, in fact, people in power who made it to the top without stepping on their desk neighbors. ""When we are presented with someone in power who's a jerk ... it sticks out to us. It's very salient,"" Anderson said. ""And I think we notice those (people) much more than we do people in power who are nice -- those people kind of blend into the background. Examples of people in power who are just awful human beings are more available in people's minds."" How this perception occurs and affects people's approach to their careers is a phenomenon Anderson plans to study next, he said. How personality types fare in the office The researchers conducted two longitudinal studies in which they measured US college students' personality traits before entering the workforce and then the power they attained within their workplaces by 2018, about 14 years later. Participants reported their power, control over their subordinates and rank in their company's hierarchy, three factors which were combined into an overall power score. The research subjects also rated their company's combativeness and size and included how long they had worked there. Those who were more sociable, energetic and assertive in their college years ( ""It just seemed to be the case that no matter who you are,"" Anderson said, ""behaving in these kind of nasty, bullying, selfish ways just didn't help you."" The second study, which considered the inputs of How misused power can threaten relationships Disagreeable people were more likely to be dominant and aggressive, but less communal toward colleagues. The extroverts did behave dominantly and aggressively, but they were also nimbly able to be generous to their colleagues; contribute and work harder; and push and garner support for their ideas. ""What our findings suggest is that if disagreeable people had been nicer and maybe more communal to their colleagues, they might've had a leg up in the competition for power,"" Anderson said. Poor relationships may threaten power because ""everyone needs allies to be powerful,"" Anderson added. ""Very rarely can people have power and not have a strong set of alliances and a strong network. ... And so for disagreeable people, that erosion of their alliances is a killer."" ""We've all heard the stories of the quiet, docile individual who overcame the bully to do great things for a team or organization. A calm, level-headed approach to problem solving promotes trust and buy-in,"" said Amy Cooper Hakim, an industrial-organizational psychology practitioner and coauthor of "" ""Still, movies and television shows more often promote a 'bad boss' character instead of a transformational leader for that person in power,"" added Cooper, who wasn't involved in the study and is founder of the Cooper Strategic Group, a management consulting service. ""While they may get the job done, the environment is hostile and promotes insecurity."" Good news for the nice guys and gals The bad news from this study is that being a jerk doesn't kill your chances of obtaining power, since organizations employ disagreeable people in powerful positions just as much as they do agreeable individuals. ""The reason why that's such a problem is (because) there's a ton of research on what disagreeable people do once they're in those positions, and it's all bad,"" Anderson said. ""There's kind of a whole grocery list of studies showing how toxic they can be as leaders, either of teams, departments or organizations."" The good news is that being a jerk also doesn't give you an advantage in your What is also good to know is that behaving in ways that are considerate of others can benefit your relationships and thereby build your power in the workplace. ""So if you were to combine that very generous, giving behavior with assertiveness -- where you are also looking out for yourself and you're pushing to get things done -- that's the magic combo,"" he added. People who understand their strengths and opportunities make the best leaders, Cooper Hakim said. And by focusing on people, leaders can utilize the strengths of every team member to work together to get a job done. So take note: Even though the times we live in are especially challenging, you don't have to play dirty to be the leader of the pack.","It doesn't pay to be a jerk at work, research finds"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/20/health/senior-covid-19-brain-fog-wellness/index.html,"Kaiser Health News ""Lord, give me back my memory."" For months, as Marilyn Walters struggled to recover from Covid-19, she has repeated this prayer day and night. Like other older adults who've become critically ill from the coronavirus, Walters, 65, describes what she calls ""brain fog"" -- difficulty putting thoughts together, problems with concentration, the inability to remember what happened a short time before. This sudden cognitive dysfunction is a common concern for seniors who've survived a serious bout of Covid-19. ""Many older patients are having trouble organizing themselves and planning what they need to do to get through the day,"" said Dr. Zijian Chen, medical director of the Other challenges abound: overcoming muscle and nerve damage, improving breathing, adapting to new impairments, regaining strength and stamina and coping with the emotional toll of unexpected illness. Most seniors survive Covid-19 and will encounter these concerns to varying degrees. Even among the age group at greatest risk -- people 85 and older -- just 28% of those with confirmed cases end up dying, according to data from the Walters, who lives in Indianapolis, spent almost three weeks in March and April heavily sedated, on a ventilator, fighting for her life in intensive care. Today, she said, ""I still get tired real easy and I can't breathe sometimes. If I'm walking sometimes my legs get wobbly and my arms get like jelly."" ""Emotionally, it's been hard because I've always been able to do for myself, and I can't do that as I like. I've been really nervous and jittery,"" Walters said.  ""Recovery will be on the order of months and years, not days or weeks,"" said Dr. E. Wesley Ely, co-director of the Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction and Survivorship Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Most likely, he speculated, a year after fighting the disease at least half of the critically ill older patients will not be fully recovered. The aftereffects of delirium -- an acute, sudden change of consciousness and mental acuity -- can complicate recovery from Covid-19. Seniors hospitalized for serious illness are susceptible to the often-unrecognized condition when they're immobilized for a long time, isolated from family and friends, and given sedatives to ease agitation or narcotics for pain, among other contributing factors. In older adults, delirium is associated with a heightened risk of losing independence, developing dementia and dying. It can manifest as acute confusion and agitation or as uncharacteristic unresponsiveness and lethargy. ""What we're seeing with Covid-19 and older adults are rates of delirium in the 70% to 80% range,"" said Dr. Babar Khan, associate director of Indiana University's Center for Aging Research at the Regenstrief Institute, and one of Walters' physicians. Gordon Quinn, 77, a Chicago documentary filmmaker, believes he contracted Covid-19 at a conference in Australia in early March. At Northwestern Memorial Hospital, he was put on a ventilator twice in the ICU, for a total of nearly two weeks, and remembers having ""a lot of hallucinations"" -- a symptom of delirium. ""I remember vividly believing I was in purgatory. I was paralyzed -- I couldn't move. I could hear snatches of TV -- reruns of 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' -- and I asked myself, 'Is this my life for eternity?'"" Quinn said. Given the extent of delirium and Ely agreed. ""These patients will urgently need to work on recovery,"" he said. Family members should insist on securing rehabilitation services -- physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, cognitive rehabilitation -- after the patient leaves the hospital and returns home, he advised. ""Even at my age, people can get incredible benefit from rehab,"" said Quinn, who spent nearly two weeks at Chicago's Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, a rehabilitation hospital, before returning home and getting several weeks of home-based therapy. Today, he's able to walk nearly 2 miles and has returned to work, feeling almost back to normal. James Talaganis, 72, of Indian Head Park, Illinois, also benefited from rehab at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab after spending nearly four months in various hospitals beginning in early May. Talaganis had a complicated case of Covid-19: His kidneys failed and he was put on dialysis. He experienced cardiac arrest and was in a coma for almost 58 days while on a ventilator. He had intestinal bleeding, requiring multiple blood transfusions, and was found to have crystallization and fibrosis in his lungs. When Talaganis began his rehab on August 22, he said, ""my whole body, my muscles were atrophied. I couldn't get out of bed or go to the toilet. I was getting fed through a tube. I couldn't eat solid foods."" In early October, after getting hours of therapy each day, Talaganis was able to walk 660 feet in six minutes and eat whatever he wanted. ""My recovery -- it's a miracle. Every day I feel better,"" he said. Unfortunately, rehabilitation needs for most older adults are often overlooked. Notably, a ""Seniors who live in more rural areas or outside bigger cities where major hospital systems are providing cutting-edge services are at significant risk of losing out on this potentially restorative care,"" said Dr. Sean Smith, an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Michigan. Sometimes what's most needed for recovery from critical illness is human connection. That was true for Tom and Virginia Stevens of Nashville, Tennessee, in their late 80s, who were both hospitalized with Covid-19 in early August. Ely, one of their physicians, found them in separate hospital rooms, frightened and miserable. ""I'm worried about my husband,"" he said Virginia told him. ""Where am I? What is happening? Where is my wife?"" the doctor said Tom asked, before crying out, ""I have to get out of here."" Ely and another physician taking care of the couple agreed. Being isolated from each other was dangerous for this couple, married for 66 years. They needed to be put in a room together. When the doctor walked into their new room the next day, he said, ""it was a night-and-day difference."" The couple was sipping coffee, eating and laughing on beds that had been pushed together. ""They both got better from that point on. I know that was because of the loving touch, being together,"" Ely said. That doesn't mean recovery has been easy. Virginia and Tom still struggle with confusion, fatigue, weakness and anxiety after their two-week stay in the hospital, followed by two weeks in inpatient rehabilitation. Now, they're in a new assisted living residence, which is allowing outdoor visits with their family. ""Doctors have told us, it will take a long time and they may never get back to where they were before Covid,"" said their daughter, Karen Kreager, also of Nashville. ""But that's OK. I'm just so grateful that they came through this and we get to spend more time with them.""",Senior Covid-19 patients suffer 'brain fog' in drawn-out recovery
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/19/health/health-crisis-plan-wellness-partner/index.html,"Kaiser Health News Earlier this month, my husband picked up the phone and learned his 92-year-old father had been taken to the hospital that morning, feeling sick and short of breath. We were nearly 2,000 miles away, on a vacation in the mountains of southern Colorado. No, it wasn't Covid-19. My father-in-law, Mel - who has diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease - was suffering from fluid buildup in his legs and around his lungs and excruciating knee pain. Intravenous medications and steroid injections were administered, and he responded well. Doctors monitored Mel carefully, adjusted his medications and recommended a few weeks of home health care after eight days in the hospital. In other words, this was not a life-threatening emergency. Yet we realized how poorly prepared we were for a real crisis, should one arise. We needed a plan. Why didn't we have one already? The usual reasons: denial, avoidance and wishful thinking. It was easier to imagine that Mel would be all right until it became clear that we couldn't take that for granted. Although I routinely advise readers about preparing for changes in their health, I didn't want to be a know-it-all with my husband's family. Their assumption seemed to be ""We'll deal with whatever comes up when that happens."" Now, eyes wide open, we got organized.   My husband respects his father's autonomy and didn't press the point. So when Mel went to the hospital a few weeks ago, he was alone, with no one to turn to for assistance. This was especially problematic because Mel has hearing loss, and it is almost impossible to talk with him by phone. ""How are you, Dad?"" my husband yelled on twice-a-day calls to check on his father in the hospital. ""What?"" Mel replied querulously. This was repeated a few times, with mounting frustration and no useful information exchanged. Now a care manager who could serve as our eyes and ears on the ground was necessary, not optional, and we hired back the professional we'd already found.  When we spoke with the physician overseeing Mel's care in the hospital, he suggested that ""companion care"" for at least a few weeks would be a good idea. Mel needed someone to help him up out of the chair, stay at his side while he walked to the bathroom and bring him a glass of water, among other tasks. We also realized we needed to arrange for meals to be delivered to Mel and for someone from his senior community to buy groceries for him -- a service they'd started during the pandemic. An excellent organization that works with older adults in Mel's area supplied me with a list of 21 agencies that provide these kinds of services -- a dizzying array of choices. Fortunately, the senior community where Mel lives recommended an agency that often works with its residents. We hired 24/7 care for several days after Mel left the hospital with the understanding that we'd continue services if necessary. Now, this agency is on our list of essential resources.  But it was clear Mel wanted to go home after being in the hospital instead of going to that rehab. Medicare would pay for a few weeks of visits from nurses and physical and occupational therapists. Would that be enough to set him on the road to recovery? We had no idea. If Mel couldn't return to his previous level of functioning after returning home, he might need to transition to assisted living, where he could receive more medical oversight and assistance. How would this work? We didn't know and asked the geriatric care manager to find out.  But Mel hadn't prepared a document naming all three sons as his ""personal representatives"" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. This waives privacy concerns and gives them access to his medical information. It went on our ""to-do"" list. The brothers also didn't have a complete list of Mel's doctors, the medications he was on and why he was taking them. That was another item for our list, especially important since Mel left the hospital with prescriptions for 14 medications, several of them new. While he'd always managed on his own before, in his post-hospital fog it was clear he was nervous about managing this complicated regimen.  I've written for years about geriatricians' comprehensive approach to the health of older adults. It turns out, there's a top-notch group of geriatricians affiliated with the hospital where Mel was being treated. After several calls, I reached one who agreed to see Mel after he was released from the hospital. Now, we have another new team member who can help us understand Mel's health trajectory and issues that might arise going forward.  With Mel's hearing problems, doing this over the phone won't do. My husband would have to fly cross-country and, ideally, meet his New York brother at Mel's place for a conversation of this kind. Before that happens, the brothers should talk among themselves. What's their understanding of what Mel wants? Are they on the same page? Also, no one has discussed financial arrangements. Each time we explain to Mel one of the new services we've arranged, his first question is ""What's the cost?"" His impulse is to guard his cherished savings and not to spend. My husband tells him he shouldn't worry, but this, too, is a conversation that has to happen.  Now, Mel has a new set of supports in place that should help him weather the period ahead. And my husband is keenly aware that planning doesn't stop here. He'll be attending to his father far more carefully going forward.","Knowing a plan Is needed for a sick relative, it can still take a crisis to act"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/24/world/women-rights-coronavirus-intl/index.html,"CNN The From a spike in domestic violence and restricted A CNN analysis earlier this year found that in the countries for which data was available, men were 50% more likely than women to die after being diagnosed with Covid-19. But experts say focusing purely on health data is dangerous. ""We think about this crisis in very narrow terms, only focusing on the health impacts, but we're missing the bigger picture,"" said Julia Smith, a researcher at the Simon Fraser University in Canada. Smith is working on a multi-year project looking at the wider impact of the pandemic. ""Men are having worse health outcomes if they become infected, but when we think about the secondary impacts, here we see that women are being disproportionately affected,"" she added. The pandemic is worsening problems women were facing even before it started. ""Crises like this exacerbate already existing structural inequalities in society - when it comes to women's rights, women's health, and women's economic status, this is exactly what we are seeing now,"" said Kristina Lunz, co-founder of Women's rights as an afterthought Smith said that when marginalized groups are underrepresented at the decision-making table, their rights and needs are often forgotten. ""And unfortunately, women's rights are almost always an afterthought in any crisis situation,"" she said. As the virus started spreading around the world, many governments abruptly announced strict lockdowns, confining most citizens to their homes. While this helped slow down the outbreak, authorities in a number of countries recorded a worrying consequence: Many activists say it was painfully obvious that such abuse would increase in a lockdown situation. Numerous studies have shown that stressful events such as economic downturns or natural disasters often lead to higher instances of gender-based violence. ""Imagine all the women that have been locked down with a man that is causing them harm ... many of these women have reported this to the police before, they could have been reached out to and taken away before the confinement started,"" said Elena Marban Castro, a fellow at the Yet in the vast majority of countries, domestic violence was not something governments addressed in any way when announcing the policy. ""This should be a top-of-the-mind, completely natural thing for governments to be prioritizing,"" said Megan O'Donnell, an assistant director of the Gender Program at the ""When we think about pandemic preparedness, the same way we should be thinking of having enough front-line health workers or protective equipment, we should be thinking about any quarantine or social distancing measures having impact on gender based violence, especially within the family."" Some governments did step in once the problem become apparent. The French government said it would pay for 20,000 nights in hotel rooms for victims and opened pop-up counseling centers at supermarkets. It launched a campaign encouraging women to ""But these women have already experienced the violence ... we need to respond to the issue before the rates go up,"" Smith said. Marban Castro said the lockdown has also In the US, several states' officials opted to This has potentially dangerous effects. Studies have shown that the number of stillbirths and maternal deaths increased in some countries hit by Ebola, because women were unable to access the appropriate services. And the lack of access to family planning has long-term consequences that will be felt beyond the pandemic, according to Lunz. ""Whenever women do not have control over their own bodies, over how many children they want and when they want to have a family, these women and their children and their families are kept in poverty."" Financial hardship Data so far is showing that the economic consequences of the pandemic are also harsher for women. One example: 55% of the ""A lot of the industries that are being most affected by the outbreak - tourism and other service industries, care work sector - those industries tend to be dominated by women,"" Smith said. And while many countries have stepped in to provide help to people who lost their jobs, many women are likely slipping through the cracks. ""When you think about economic recovery, we'll need to consider that bailout packages focus just on formal employment and women are disproportionately informal workers, so we need to think about how should we be targeting them,"" O'Donnell said. At the same time, many more women than men have found themselves on the front lines of the battle against the virus. According to the World Health Organization, 70% of the global health and social care workers are women. Women around the world are also still responsible for the majority of unpaid childcare and housework. According to estimates by the UN, women spend on average 4.1 hours a day doing unpaid care and domestic work, compared to 1.7 hours spent by men. There is no hard data showing the impact of schools being closed on Single parents, most of whom are women, are hit hardest by school closures. Lunz said the crisis will likely affect women's careers in the long term, setting back the quest for equality. ""What we know from history, when women do not have access to resources and are not independent and cannot sustain themselves, they are dependent on someone else."" 'Not thinking about anyone else' The pandemic has also presented some world leaders with an ""Autocratic leaders and toxic leaders are always the biggest threat to women's rights,"" Lunz said. ""That is what history shows, and that's what we are seeing now, looking at Viktor Orban for example, it was last week that the parliament in Hungary, where his party has a majority, passed the law which restricts the country from making the Istanbul Convention from becoming law."" The Istanbul Convention is the world's first legally binding treaty entirely dedicated to combating violence against women. Lunz, Marban Castro, Smith and O'Donnell all said the current crisis shows exactly why women need to be ""at the table"" when decisions are made. Many have pointed out that ""The whole situation is crazy,"" Marban Castro said. ""Before we put in a measure, we have to think how it's going to affect all the people in our society - women, children, minorities, homeless people ... this has not happened, the measures have been put in for and by middle-aged men who are not thinking about anyone else.""",Coronavirus is killing more men.

Such practices could help kids with ""Mindfulness to me is like a superpower for children,"" he said. ""The more they can feel connected to themselves, to others and to their environment, the more they can thrive and feel supported, and feel like they can do whatever they want to do."" You don't need to be an expert to try mindfulness with kids. Trying mindfulness together can be powerful, said Susan Kaiser Greenland, a mindfulness expert and the author of "" ""Modeling is key,"" Kaiser Greenland said. ""The true benefit of it is not just bringing in an outside mindfulness teacher like you bring in a piano teacher. Where it really starts is with the parent themselves."" In fact, it can sometimes help for parents to experiment on their own first, Kaiser Greenland said. (You can begin right now with one of these Or you can make it a shared endeavor. We've got five great ways to practice mindfulness with your children -- and Kaiser Greenland said it's never too early (or too late) to start. 1. Try mindful breathing Breathing is among the most common mindfulness practices. Often, mindful breathing means choosing one sensation -- such as the breath in your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest -- and bringing your attention there. You can try it for 30 seconds or five minutes. When you get distracted, simply redirect your attention back to the sensation of breath. With children young enough to have stuffed animals and dolls, Kaiser Greenland recommends a simple breathing practice using a favorite toy. ""They have the stuffed animal on their tummy or on their chest, or someplace where they can really feel the movement of breathing,"" she said. ""Focus in on that sensation of moving the animal up and down with their breathing. That's a wonderful bedtime ritual."" 2. Take a gratitude walk You don't have to sit still to practice mindfulness, said Kaiser Greenland, who recommends inviting kids to join you for a ""gratitude walk."" It's something you can try inside or in a peaceful place outside. With your gaze on the ground, simply take slow steps. With every footfall, think of something that you're grateful for. ""It could just be a walk from the kitchen sink to the dining room table and back,"" she said. If you're doing a mindfulness walk with a younger child, ask them to share their gratitude out loud. ""With every step we say something we're grateful for. I'm grateful for macaroni and cheese, I'm grateful for my puppy, I'm grateful for you, that sort of thing,"" Kaiser Greenland said. For older kids and adults, the gratitude can be spoken silently if they choose. 3. Shake it off If your kid is feeling restless, Kaiser Greenland said, it can help to try something even more active. ""First thing you need to do is release some nervous energy,"" she said. ""If you toggle between movement and stillness, that has a more grounding effect."" Kaiser Greenland recommends alternating a minute of movement with a few minutes of stillness. ""You just shake to the sound of a beat of a drum, or you shake your arm then shake your leg,"" she said. After that, it's time to bring your child's attention to the sensations in their body or things in the immediate environment. ""Feel your breathing. Listen to a sound. You feel your feet against the floor,"" she said. ""Then you shake again."" 4. Practice noticing While many mindfulness practices involve looking inward, it's a perspective you can bring to observing the world around you, too. ""If a child is having a hard time, I might ask them to find three blue objects in the room they're sitting in,"" said Spencer, the mindfulness educator. ""Just to give them something external to focus on. That way, they can downshift their nervous system a little bit."" Noticing is a mindfulness practice adults and children can try together, wherever they are. It doesn't have to be visual. Sometimes, Spencer will invite children to listen to the most distant sound they can identify. Then, he'll shift the focus to sounds in the middle distance. Finally, kids tune into sound in their immediate surroundings. ""Connecting to their senses in that way, I think, is really supportive,"" he said. ""It's really focused on that self-awareness, and building the capacity to pay attention."" 5. Stream a guided meditation Trying out mindfulness doesn't have to be complicated, but it's nice to have help as you start to explore. That's where guided meditations come in, a wide range of mostly free recordings that walk you through mindfulness step by step. Kaiser Greenland narrates a series of ""If you're a beginner, it's great to be guided,"" said Diana Winston, director of mindfulness education at UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center. ""You have some support and learn how to do it correctly.""(The free UCLA Winston, who has practiced meditation for decades, believes mindfulness practices can be enormously helpful to children. She cites stress reduction, attention building, improved test scores and social-emotional learning as key benefits. But research into mindfulness for children, she said, has a long way to go. ""If the research is young with adults, it's significantly younger with children,"" said Winston, who is the author of ""It seems to be very positive, but it's not like we should immediately say mindfulness is going to solve all the problems of our failing school systems. It's not like that."" Not only that, Winston said that mindfulness practices aren't for every family. ""It's a wonderful tool that can be useful and helpful,"" she said. ""Just like there's no medication that works for everybody. It's the same for meditation. Some people really respond to it and love it, and others don't find it helpful. And that's absolutely fine.""",Try these 5 ways to practice mindfulness with your kids
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/28/health/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-begins-biontech/index.html,"CNN Drug giant Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have begun an advanced trial of one of their experimental coronavirus vaccines in volunteers in the United States. The first four participants were dosed Monday at the University of Rochester Medical Center, a spokesman there said. The combined Phase 2/3 trial, which looks for safety, efficacy and optimal dosing of a vaccine or drug, will include up to 30,000 participants. It was the second advanced trial of a coronavirus vaccine to get under way in the United States Monday. Earlier Monday, Earlier this month, Pfizer and BioNTech released preliminary data showing that one of their vaccines, known only by its experimental name BNT162b1, appeared safe and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses in a Phase 1/2 trial. But the company has moved ahead with a slightly different candidate. This one will move forward in the combined Phase 2/3 trial, at about 120 sites worldwide, including 39 US states and Argentina, Brazil and Germany. Pfizer's coronavirus vaccines all use pieces of genetic material to prompt the vaccine recipient to make antibodies against specific parts of the coronavirus. Pfizer and BioNTech's first vaccine targeted a piece of the spike protein, a structure the virus uses to infect human cells. The second vaccine, being moved into advanced trials, targets the entire spike structure. ""This decision reflects our primary goal to bring a well-tolerated, highly effective vaccine to the market as quickly as possible, while we will continue to evaluate our other vaccine candidates as part of a differentiated COVID-19 vaccine portfolio,"" BioNTech founder Dr. Ugur Sahin Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the US government's Covid-19 vaccine effort, Operation Warp Speed, said building on earlier, tested vaccine platforms allows speedier development of vaccines while still being safe. ""We're selecting very carefully and thoughtfully vaccine technologies that are very likely to work, and work for us, because we know them somewhat,"" Slaoui said Tuesday at the privately sponsored Disease Prevention and Control Summit. Both versions of Pfizer's vaccine elicit antibody responses as well as immune cells called T-cells, the company said. If a vaccine activates both arms of the immune system the hope is it will be more effective and provide more durable protection. A Phase 1 study typically involves a small number of people and focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and elicits some kind of immune response. In Phase 2, the clinical study is expanded and the vaccine is given to people who have characteristics - such as age and physical health - similar to those for whom the new vaccine is intended, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and again for safety. If the vaccine works, Pfizer and BioNTech say they're on track to seek regulatory review as early as October, and if it wins emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, they could supply up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020, and about 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Last week the US Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense announced Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine is one of 25 in clinical trials around the world, According to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States, more than 4.2 million cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States and more than 148,000 people have died.",Pfizer and BioNTech begin large-scale trial of coronavirus vaccine in the United States
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/15/health/teen-empathy-secure-family-relationships-wellness/index.html,"CNN Teenagers who have close, secure relationships with their families are more likely to extend empathy to their peers, according to a new study. More specifically, when teens feel safe, supported by and connected to parents or other adult caregivers, they are better equipped to pass the empathy they receive on to others. ""I don't think teens in particular like being told what to do, and I don't think it's going to work to tell teens they should empathize with other people,"" said Jessica Stern, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychology at the University of Virginia. ""But what does work is showing them empathy, and they can pay it forward to the people in their lives."" Stern's work revolves around how having secure relationships contributes to prosocial behavior, or behavior driven by the intent to benefit others. She studies parent-child relationships, also known as attachment theory, which is ""the idea that all human beings have a fundamental need for connection,"" but the quality of those connections may differ. Stern said those differences matter because they ""shape who we become over time."" Teens who are more empathic show lower levels of aggression and prejudice and are less likely to bully, Stern added, and this is why understanding how relationships shape empathy is important.  Stern said this prompted the teens to share descriptions and stories about their families. Researchers paid attention not only to what the teens said, but also how they articulated it. ""Some of those stories have a lot of pain, some of them have a lot of real beauty and closeness, but we're really looking for how teens tell their stories,"" Stern said. ""So, can teens talk about their close relationships in a way that's calm and clear? Can they take a situation that's maybe difficult and make sense out of it?"" After these initial interviews, researchers went back to the participants at ages 16, 17 and 18 and observed their interactions with a close friend. The researchers noted how the participants responded when their friend presented a problem and confided in them, assessing the participants' extension of empathy. Teens who had more secure family relationships showed higher empathy toward their friends at ages 16 and 17 than less secure teens. It's not all bad news, though, because the less secure teens ""caught up"" in their empathic behavior by age 18, to Stern's surprise. This is cause for hope, she said, because it may indicate that those empathic skills can develop over time for adolescents who don't have great relationships at home. Stern suggested that having strong friendships or a trusted teacher might make an impact on insecure teens' empathy, but she said further research should be done to learn more. The results are consistent with considerable past research connecting positive relationships with the development of empathy in adolescence, said Mary Buckingham, a research assistant professor in the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development at Tufts University. She was not involved in the study. ""Relationships with important adults matter for empathy development,"" Buckingham said. ""The results suggest that, in order to raise an empathic adolescent, parents need to model and encourage empathy."" She said that, as stated in the study, the research shows a correlation between secure relationships and empathy, but it should not be interpreted as a causal relationship at this time. Additional research must examine not only the quality of the attachment relationship between a parent and child, but also the potential impacts of socialization and other aspects of parenting, Buckingham added. Since the research focused on averages across the study sample, she also said an examination of individual differences between participants is necessary. ""The article does not illuminate the individual differences that might exist within adolescents, and the specificity of each adolescent's development that might be occurring,"" Buckingham said. ""Future research should examine what specific experiences, for what youth, in what broader contexts, at what points in the life span, may lead to attachment and empathy links."" More research is already being conducted on this particular group of participants, who are now in their mid 30s, Stern said. Led by Joseph Allen, professor of psychology and head of the Adolescent Research Group at the University of Virginia, the researchers are interested in seeing how the empathic abilities they examined in the teens now shape their romantic relationships and parenting behavior as adults. Being able to pick up on other people's emotions and see from their point of view is important ""for a variety of other things that we consider success in the world,"" Stern said. For parents and even teachers, Stern advises understanding the necessity of empathy and really investing in relationships with teens. Providing models of empathic behavior, including treating others with kindness, respect and support, can help adolescents internalize that behavior, whether they are conscious of this or not. Adults should also encourage teens to invest in their relationships with their friends, which the study found helps build empathy as a skill as well, Stern said. However, she added, whom teenagers decide to befriend does matter. ""We all have different types of families and we can't choose our family, but we can choose our friends,"" Stern said. ""Choose your friends wisely and choose the people who make you feel secure, supported and connected and who have your back, and do that for them, too, because it actually really matters.""","Root of teen empathy begins with secure relationships at home, study finds"
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/14/health/weed-impact-driving-wellness/index.html,"CNN Running red lights. Driving at high speeds. Crossing center lines into the opposite lanes. Getting into accidents - even hitting pedestrians. A new study found these were some of the dangerous driving behaviors of regular, heavy users of recreational weed who began using before the age of 16. Here's the catch: users drove this badly even when they were no longer high. The study, published Tuesday in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, asked chronic, heavy marijuana users to drive in a customized driving simulator. ""Heavy use was defined by daily or near daily use, a minimum of four or five times a week, with a lifetime exposure of 1,500 times,"" said Staci Gruber, director of the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery (MIND) program at McLean Hospital, the largest psychiatric teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. At the time of driving experience, the marijuana group had not used for at least 12 hours, and based on urine tests were not intoxicated on THC, the main psychoactive compound in recreational marijuana. Despite having little THC in their system, heavy users consistently performed worse on driving tasks than non-users, making critical, dangerous mistakes. The worst drivers? Those who began using regularly before age 16. ""Prior to age 16, the brain is especially neurodevelopmentally vulnerable, not just to cannabis but to other drugs, alcohol, illness, injury,"" Gruber said. ""The brain is really under construction, or if you're in the cannabis world, 'half-baked.' ""And when we looked at the cannabis users and separated those into early (before age 16) versus later onset of use, almost exclusively these differences between the two groups were attributed to the early onset group,"" Gruber said. ""So it's really early exposure to cannabis that appears to confer greater difficulty with complex cognitive tasks like driving."" That wasn't a real surprise, said study co-author Mary Kathryn Dahlgren, a post-doctoral fellow at MIND. ""Research has consistently shown that early substance use, including the use of cannabis, is associated with poorer cognitive performance,"" Dahlgren said, ""specifically tasks controlled by the most frontal part of the brain, the part behind the eyebrows."" That's also the part of the brain that controls our impulses, a major factor in appropriate behavior choices. ""We've documented the role of impulsivity in cannabis users previously, and it does appear that earlier onset may confer a decreased ability to inhibit inappropriate responses,"" Gruber said, adding that science doesn't completely understand the relationship. ""What comes first? Is it these impulsivity differences that drive early cannabis use? Is it early cannabis use that drives impulsivity differences? That question really needs to be addressed in future  longitudinal studies that look at these folks before they ever begin using cannabis."" Does this same concern apply to users of medicinal marijuana? Not at all, Gruber says. ""In our medical cannabis patients we don't see that at all. We actually see improvements,"" she said. Surveys indicate that approximately 124 million Americans aged 12 or older have tried weed at least once, with almost 28 million reporting use within the last month, according to the With more and more states legalizing weed for recreational use - But both Gruber and Dahlgren stress it's too early to tell how significant these results may be. ""By no means does this data suggest that everybody who uses cannabis is impaired, they can't drive,"" Dahlgren said. ""But we do need to be mindful of our youngest, most vulnerable consumers with regard to the age at which they become exposed and perhaps begin using regularly, because there may be downstream effects of that use later on."" That is especially worrisome considering the fact that weed appears to be replacing cigarettes in recent national surveys, Gruber said. ""Daily cigarette use among 12th graders was 2.4% and marijuana use was 6.4%,"" she said. ""Remember the whole campaign with Nancy Reagan, 'Just say no,' and how it did not work? So we say to teens, 'Just not yet.' Give your brain more time and opportunity to develop before you use.""",Weed impairs driving skills long after the high is gone
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/22/health/elmer-huerta-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-wellness/index.html,"CNN Not enough Blacks and Latinos are participating in US vaccine trials to fight Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. More than 50% of cases of Covid-19 in the United States are African Americans or Latinos, yet they make up only 15% of participants in the first Phase III vaccine trial in the United States, co-developed by biotech company Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. In fact, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins gave the trial a ""C"" grade for recruiting minorities. ""From the first week I saw the numbers, and they were not as encouraging as I would have liked,"" Collins told CNN. The vaccine could be delayed if the trials don't recruit enough minorities. That's why Huerta, a longtime public health advocate, volunteered for the Phase III trial. ""When you have a clinical trial, it's extremely important for all the races and ethnicities to be represented because sometimes there are differences in toxicity and effectiveness of a medication or vaccine,"" Huerta said. ""As a Latino I thought it was very important for me to participate."" Huerta, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University, was elected president of the American Cancer Society in 2007, becoming the first Latino president in its history. He is also the founder and director of the Cancer Preventorium at the Washington Cancer Institute, and hosts several radio programs with RPP Noticias de Peru focusing on health care and more. Why are Black and Latinos hardest hit? There are a number of reasons why Black and Brown communities have higher risks for catching Covid-19 and having more severe reactions that can lead to hospitalization and death. One factor is that long-standing discrimination and social inequities can lead to limited access to health care and make those populations more likley to have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, There are also structural factors, such as economic and housing policies; and social factors, such as essential worker employment status requiring in-person work, according to the CDC report. Black leaders agree that it's hard to recruit Black people into the vaccine trials. ""When we Black people hear 'clinical trials,' we think 'we're not going to be researched on,' and that's across economic status and across educational status, not just one sector,"" Renee Mahaffey Harris, president and CEO of The Center for Closing the Health Gap in Cincinnati, Huerta, who takes questions on his Spanish-language podcast, "" ""Please, especially African Americans and Latinos who are underrepresented in this study, consider it,"" Huerta said. "" You are going to get your injection, you will participate, the study lasts for 25 months, and you will be helping yourself and the community."" Half the study participants receive the real vaccine, and half get a placebo. Participants will track if they have symptoms or side effects for about two years. In the meantime, Huerta has some advice. ""We want to remind you that - until we have an effective and available vaccine or medication - the use of a mask, keeping a distance of at least two meters from other people and washing your hands frequently, are the best measures to fight against infection by the new coronavirus,"" said Huerta, Practicing one of those safety measures should not cause the others to be neglected, he added.

https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/19/health/resolutions-food-drayer-wellness/index.html,"CNN The New Year is right around the corner, and if you are looking to makeover your diet there are some simple suggestions to help you eat healthier in 2020. I'm not talking about a major food overhaul, but month-by-month ""mini-resolutions"" that will give you a complete nutritional upgrade by next December. You can introduce these small goals with each new month, however the order you tackle them depends on your individual needs. For example, you may find that it makes sense to start the New Year by avoiding triggers and seeking support - and then add the other diet suggestions in the order you wish. I'd recommend putting each mini-resolution in your calendar at the beginning of each month so you have a reminder of each goal you've committed to. 1. Prioritize protein This is my number one nutritional tip for overall health and weight management. Protein is a key building block for skin, hair, nails and bones, and it also helps preserve muscle mass as we age, which helps keep metabolism running at full speed. Consuming a meal with protein makes us feel fuller and can help us consume fewer calories overall than a meal that consists only of carbohydrates and fat. To boost your protein intake, aim to include at least 3 ounces (a deck of card's worth) of fish, poultry or lean meat with each meal, or at least a  1/2 cup of beans or lentils. For breakfast, consider egg whites, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt or peanut butter on whole wheat toast. 2. Eat more plants Plant-based diets can help reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and obesity. But if you haven't been able to dive into a full meat makeover, don't worry. Start by simply For example, replace meat with beans when making tacos; swap meat for veggies in lasagna and other pasta recipes, or consider chickpeas in place of chicken in salads and dishes, like a ""chickpea"" masala dish instead of chicken masala. I enjoy making 3.  Start a meal with soup or salad Enjoying a cup of soup before a meal is one of the few occasions where adding an appetizer fills you up and helps you consume fewer calories for the entire meal, Salads offer 4. Focus on fiber Aside from protein, fiber is another nutritional winner. It's packed in nutrient-rich foods, like fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes, and it gives you a feeling of fullness without contributing any calories. A quick and easy way to boost your fiber intake is to incorporate two fruits and vegetables into your day as snacks. For other fiber-boosting strategies, try sprinkling fiber-rich chia seeds or Fiber One on top of your favorite cereal or yogurt; opt for Wasa crackers or whole wheat bread instead of white bread; and bake with white whole wheat flour. My 5. Stay hydrated Drinking water and Try filling up a large water bottle each day to carry along with you, and consider making your own naturally flavored water pitcher at home with lemon, orange or cucumber slices. If you need a reminder to drink, consider the 6. Experiment with new recipes One of the best ways to combat food boredom is to try new recipes, which can offer fun and creative ways to boost the nutritional value of your diet. Check out new cookbooks, cooking magazines, food sections in newspapers, social media pics or the internet for inspiration. If you are looking for a new way to enjoy spaghetti squash for example, you can simply Google it! For some innovative vegetarian ideas, check out my 7.  Slash sugars A diet high in On average Americans consume about 22 teaspoons of added sugar a day, which amounts to an extra 350 calories! To easily slash sugars from your diet, cut out all sugar-sweetened beverages, including soft drinks and fruit drinks, as well as candy, cookies, sweetened breakfast cereals and dairy foods with added sugars. And beware of hidden sugars in foods like condiments, salad dressings, tomato sauce and breads. 8.  Try intermittent fasting When it was first introduced, it may have seemed strange, but more and more research is revealing the According to experts, a critical aspect of fasting - which is different from simply restricting calories - is that the body undergoes a metabolic switch from using glucose to using ketones as fuel, a result of the depletion of liver energy stores and the mobilization of fat. I'm personally not a fan of strict fasting regimens, but I do see the value in limiting the amount of time spent eating during the course of a day, as it can eliminate problems like mindless nibbling and possibly improve health.  If you want to experiment with fasting, I'd recommend a time-restricted feeding approach, where you consume all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day, depending on what you can handle. 9.  Keep a food journal  Planning meals and snacks in a food journal before you eat can help to ensure that your day is filled with nutrient-rich foods, and it can also help you budget for sweet treats, fried foods and alcohol.  If writing in a notebook is inconvenient, consider an app like 10.  Be more mindful when eating That means turning off our phones, iPads, TVs and other screens that Being more mindful during meals can also help us pay attention to our internal hunger and fullness cues, which can help inform us of when we've had enough to eat. 11. Avoid food triggers It can be difficult to resist tempting foods and desserts that can derail you from achieving your health goals when they're staring you in the face. Because of this reality, I live by a simple strategy: ""Out of sight, out of mind."" You can make it easier to stick to your goals by simply avoiding your triggers. This can mean not purchasing tempting foods at the supermarket; walking home on a path that avoids passing your favorite fast food joint or ice cream shop; or avoiding restaurants where you are tempted to overdo it. 12.  Seek support One of the most important aspects of achieving a healthier diet is having a circle of friends or family members who support your goals.  Even just one person to share your experiences with can be helpful.  If you find you need more support or professional guidance with following a specific nutrition plan, I recommend meeting with a registered dietitian nutritionist.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/13/health/nursing-homes-visit-coronavirus-wellness-partner/index.html,"Kaiser Health News States across the country are beginning to roll back heart-wrenching policies instituted when the coronavirus pandemic began and allow in-person visits at nursing homes and assisted living centers, offering relief to frustrated families. For the most part, visitors are required to stay outside and meet relatives in gardens or on patios where they stay at least 6 feet apart, supervised by a staff member. Appointments are scheduled in advance and masks are mandated. Only one or two visitors are permitted at a time. Before these get-togethers, visitors get temperature checks and answer screening questions to assess their health. Hugs or other physical contact are not allowed. If residents or staff at a facility develop new cases of Covid-19,  visitation is not permitted. As of July 7, 26 states and the District of Columbia had given Eighteen states and the District of Columbia were similarly planning to allow visits Visitation policies may change, however, if state officials become concerned about a rise in Covid-19 cases. And individual facilities are not obligated to open up to families, even when a state says they can do so. Relaxing restrictions is not without risks. Frail older adults in long-term care are exceptionally vulnerable to Covid-19. According to various estimates, 40% to 45% of Covid-related deaths have occurred in these facilities. But anguished families say loved ones are suffering too much, mentally and physically, after nearly four months in isolation. Since nursing homes and assisted living centers closed to visitors in mid-March, under guidance from federal health authorities, older adults have been mostly confined to their rooms, with minimal human interaction. The goal was to protect residents from the coronavirus as the pandemic began to escalate. But the virus entered facilities nonetheless as staffers came and went. And now, families argue, the harms of isolation exceed potential benefits. ""My mother stopped eating around the middle of April -- now she just picks at her food,"" said Marlisa Mills of Asheville, North Carolina. ""Every week, she becomes more delusional."" Mill's mother, 95, has dementia and lives in a nearby nursing home that remains closed to visitors. Residents ""are dying of broken hearts and neglect,"" said Lelia Sizemore, whose 84-year-old father's health deteriorated precipitously after her mother stopped her daily visits to his Dayton, Ohio, nursing home in early March. Diagnosed with severe dementia, blind and unable to feed himself, Sizemore's father lost more than 10 pounds in two months and succumbed to respiratory failure on May 24. Even at the end, the nursing home refused her mother's requests to see him in person. ""I didn't even get to say goodbye,"" sobbed Sizemore, who lives in Oregon and last saw her father in July 2019.

On June 19, the state's health commissioner Broadway House for Continuing Care, a Newark facility, quickly notified families and arranged to pitch a tent with chairs and tables underneath in a garden area. ""It's time to open things up some more: We've all been operating under a sense of being under house arrest,"" said James Gonzalez, chief executive officer of Broadway House and chair of the board of the Health Care Association of New Jersey. With weekly tests, 10 residents and 26 staffers at Broadway House have learned they had Covid-19. One resident has died since the outbreak began. ""Are we worried about visitors bringing the virus? Yes, but I think we can manage that,"" Gonzalez said. ""We're going to have to take this day by day."" On Father's Day, Raul Lugo arrived at Broadway House to visit his grandmother, Rosa Perez, 89, who raised him after his mother died when he was an infant. He had not seen Perez, who had contracted Covid-19 and spent two months in the hospital, since the end of March. Because Perez is frail and it was extremely hot, they met in the facility's vestibule. ""She told me she missed me and that she loves me. I told her I love her back,"" said Lugo, a truck driver. ""It was 1,000 times better seeing her in person than talking to her on the phone. You can't compare it. It was awesome."" Complete Care Management, which operates 16 nursing homes in New Jersey, opened all its facilities to visitors within a week of the announcement of the state's new policy. Complete Care asks visitors to sign consent forms indicating they understand the risks and will let staffers know if they become ill. No one is allowed to bring food or enter the buildings, even to use the restrooms. For the time being, get-togethers are short -- no more than 15 minutes and no more than two visitors at a time. ""Really, the only burdensome part of it is having staff available to bring residents outside, wait with them and bring them back in,"" said Efraim Siegfried, Complete Care's chief executive officer. ""If we do everything right, I don't see a negative outcome. And to see how excited people are, how happy they are, it's a beautiful thing."" Before the pandemic, Patricia Tietjen, 72, visited her husband of 52 years, Robert, who has dementia, every day at Complete Care at Green Acres in Toms River, New Jersey. Though staffers tried to arrange FaceTime visits when the home closed to visitors, ""it was hard because he was never awake -- he started sleeping all the time -- and he can't speak anymore,"" Tietjen said. Robert became ill with Covid-19 in April. Although he survived that, he recently entered hospice care and Tietjen has twice been let into the facility because he is near the end of his life. ""It was extremely emotional,"" she said, breaking into tears. Although federal guidance says visitors should be permitted inside long-term care facilities at the end of life, this is not happening as often as it should, said Lori Smetanka, executive director of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy group. She wants family visitation policies to be mandatory, not optional. As it stands, facility administrators retain considerable discretion over when and whether to offer visits because states are issuing recommendations only. Smetanka's organization has also begun a campaign, Not doing so is ""inhumane and cruel"" punishment for more than 2 million people -- most of them older adults -- living in ""solitary confinement conditions,"" said Tony Chicotel, a staff attorney at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, a campaign partner.",Visits to nursing homes resume in half of US states to the relief of families

She looked to her husband for help. He immediately called an ambulance - and Briones was admitted at a hospital in South Texas, where she stayed for almost a month to recover from what she came to learn was Covid-19. She described contracting the virus as the worst experience she's ever had. ""It's just a horrible experience to go through,"" she told CNN, through tears. ""I wish upon no one to go through it."" Briones is one of thousands of people who identify as Latinx who have suffered from the Covid-19 pandemic. The ""The shifting surge in outbreaks to the South and West will likely exacerbate the disparate effects of COVID-19 for people of color,"" KFF wrote in its People who identify as Latinx are four times more likely to be hospitalized than White people, according to data released And as coronavirus cases continue to rise across the US, many Latinos say they are growing more concerned for their lives and their community. Texas border communities hit hard In Texas' Hidalgo County - where 92.5% of the county's 860,000 residents identify as Latinx - data shows just how hard Covid-19 has hit the Latinx community. The county, which is on the border, ""Several months ago, I warned of a potential tsunami if we did not take this more seriously,"" Hidalgo County Judge Richard F. Corez said in a news release. ""The tsunami is here."" County officials have said in notifications to residents in the past few weeks that hospitals have reached capacity. Residents are strongly encouraged to stay home, as health care facilities race to add more ICU beds in anticipation for more people with complications from the virus. The South Texas Medical System in Weslaco - which is also near the border - converted conference rooms and shelf spaces to ICU areas as it continues to see an influx of coronavirus patients. They also set up a tent to handle any overflow patients, where they can treat up to 20 additional patients on top of the other areas inside the emergency department. ""The staff here, everyone is exhausted, and the patients here are very sick,"" Pablo Loredo, South Texas Health Emergency Department Nurse Director of Weslaco & Alamo, Wesley Robinson, the assistant chief nursing officer of the South Texas Health System, told CNN the medical system ""began seeing patients arrive on July 1, by July 3 they were incredibly sick - now we're at the point where we've reached well over 100% capacity."" Some experts point to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to prematurely reopen the state's economy as a reason why the virus spread so quickly. ""And that is because at the time that the (Trump) administration insisted on opening the economy where they weren't prepared,"" Dr. Joseph B. McCormick, an epidemiologist at the Brownsville campus of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, told CNN. ""We didn't fit any of the criteria that were recommended when the economy was open."" On June 25, McCormick said Texas was doing a ""pretty good job until everybody decided it was time to reopen the economy."" ""And we were not prepared to do that because we didn't have the wherewithal to do the contact tracing,"" he added. ""We didn't have testing to be able to do this."" McCormick emphasized how Covid-19 doesn't just affect someone when they've tested positive - the virus can have longlasting effects on a person. 'Frontline troops' more at risk Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, told CNN he's seen his own employees and their families suffer from Covid-19.  Even some of his own family members have tested positive for the virus, he said. The organization, one of the largest and oldest Hispanic organizations, has been working to help its members combat the effects of the virus. The latest effort included asking  Abbott to mandate masks in public spaces across the state, a move he made this month. ""The Latino workforce is the essential frontline troops,"" Garcia said. ""They're the ones that are picking the vegetables that we have. They're the ones that are working at the meat packing plants to make sure that you have a steak at your table. They're the ones that are working in the construction areas to make sure our freeways stay open and clear. They're the ones that are the truck drivers. They're the ones that the grocery stores."" Because Latino workers ""can't work from home and they're getting sick,"" he said. ""They're out."" He said he's worried about the longterm effects this will have on the community. ""From a health perspective, we're seeing many grandparents and parents pass away, hospitals bursting at the seams in Houston. They've already reached capacity,"" he said. ""This requires immediate federal and state intervention. It can not be done by a nonprofit organization like LULAC. It's going to require a community wide effort."" Frankie Miranda, president of the Hispanic Federation, a national Latino organization that supports Hispanic families and communities, said Latinos are ""dying at a higher rate because we have no other choice."" ""They are essential services,"" Miranda A lack of access to adequate health care  ""And that means they don't get the health care primary checkups they need to detect illnesses, and then those illnesses, ultimately with this pandemic, can be more than a serious health challenge, they can become deadly,"" he said. According to McCormick, many Latino workers in these essential jobs are also less likely to visit a doctor for a multitude of reasons, including a lack of health insurance or lack of time. But the community also has a high percentage of people with underlying conditions, McCormick said, noting diabetes in Hispanics is especially ""quite high."" Dr. Rojelio Mejia, an infectious disease scientist at Baylor College of Medicine, said morbidities - like diabetes, smoking, obesity and high blood pressure - which are prevalent in Latinx communities, contribute to the challenges with Covid-19. ""Just looking at the population itself, there's a higher percentage of people who have more comorbidities,"" Mejia told CNN. ""And then when they get, if they get exposed, they get infected, they can have a worse outcome than someone who doesn't have these morbidities or is not a Latino person and they have relatively good health."" For San Antonio native Beverly Barboza-Guerrero, visiting the doctor after being diagnosed with coronavirus in early June didn't really help. She had followed all proper protocols, but after a social-distanced trip to South Padre Island, she began feeling the symptoms. She visited the emergency room twice, but had no luck getting advice from doctors to help her feel better. ""I mean, we try to think back, like, what did we do wrong?"" the 30-year-old told CNN, recalling her symptoms. She said she felt 10 times worse than when she had the flu in November. ""It just felt like I couldn't breathe in,"" she said. ""It felt like if I go to sleep, like I'm not going to wake up. Like, it just felt, it felt ugly,"" she said. ""(One day) I woke up and I told my wife, I need to go to the hospital. There's something not right. I need to go to the hospital. I really cannot breathe."" The ER doctor, she said, told her to ""to just take Tylenol and just make sure you're resting, you know, make sure you're quarantining."" Another issue people are encountering, especially in Latinx communities, is false negatives for Covid-19. Antibody tests used to determine if people have been infected in the past with Covid-19 might be wrong up to half the time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In response to the surge in coronavirus cases in these hotspots, including south Texas, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday the launch of new testing sites in three hotspots - Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will offer 5,000 tests per city each day, Briones said she hopes people make the effort to stay home and educate themselves about the virus. ""You need to do it, you know,"" she said, ""because I have a feeling it's going to be for a long while, we're going to be like this.""",Latinx residents fear the toll coronavirus is taking on their lives and community

In fact, going into this crisis, the United States was the only advanced industrialized country with no national paid The economic danger of these gaps -- the gap between a workforce being held up by women and a lack of policies to support them -- became especially evident at the onset of the pandemic. To date, working women -- in particular women of color and immigrant women -- have been on the frontlines of this pandemic and the resulting economic fallout.

We need to make paid sick leave and family leave policies permanent, with adequate replacement rates for lower-wage workers, and we need adequate and affordable childcare. And, we need to invest in sectors that produce jobs women can access, while we break down barriers to employment in sectors where they are left out. Additionally, we must ensure that taxpayer-subsidized investments are not deepening existing racial and gender income and wealth disparities. For example, several banks have already prioritized the allocation of public funds to companies and small businesses with whom they have existing business relationships. While gender neutral on its face, this approach reinforces existing disparities because women-owned firms receive just 16% of As we continue to build our economic recovery, we must also seize the opportunity to create a more equitable and inclusive workplace. For example, companies that receive public funds should have to commit to providing equal pay for equal work and to closing median pay gaps across their firms. Additionally, all firms that receive recovery-related public funds should be required to implement diversity, equity and inclusion strategies that reflect industry best practices. These changes may be hard, but they are essential to creating a lasting economic recovery. Now is the time to recognize the significance of working women as co-pilots in our economic recovery and our families' financial security.

They are scattered across the globe: one is in the heart of Europe, one is in Asia and the other is in the South Pacific. But they have one thing in common: they're all led by women. The success of these and other women-led governments in dealing with a global pandemic is all the more noteworthy, given that women make up less than Early, decisive action These countries - all multi-party democracies with high levels of public trust in their governments - have contained the pandemic through early, scientific intervention. They have implemented widespread testing, easy access to quality medical treatment, aggressive contact tracing and tough restrictions on social gatherings. Take Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people - with roughly the same population as Australia - off China's east coast. Taiwan is claimed by Beijing as its territory and shunned by the World Health Organization, so it should have been highly vulnerable to an epidemic originating in mainland China. But when Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen heard about a mysterious new virus infecting the citizens of Wuhan in December last year, she immediately ordered all planes arriving from Wuhan to be inspected. She then set up an epidemic command center, ramped up production of personal protective equipment such as face masks and restricted all flights from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Taiwan's early, aggressive intervention measures have limited the outbreak to just 393 confirmed infections and six deaths. The US State Department cites Taiwan's coronavirus success in calling for Taiwan to be given observer status in the WHO's World Health Assembly. Germany, with 83 million citizens, has had over 132,000 infections but very ""Maybe our biggest strength in Germany ... is the rational decision-making at the highest level of government combined with the trust the government enjoys in the population,"" Hans-Georg Krausslich, the head of virology at University Hospital in Heidelberg, told the New Zealand is an island country of almost five million, which relies heavily on tourism.

The country has carried out ""In the face of the greatest threat to human health we have seen in over a century, Kiwis have quietly and collectively implemented a nationwide wall of defense,"" Ardern said in a speech to the nation The Nordic countries Four of the five Nordic countries are led by women. Their countries each have lower death rates from coronavirus compared to the rest of Europe. For example, Finland's Prime Minister, 34-year-old Sanna Marin, is the world's youngest leader but she has an 85% Iceland's Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir governs a small, island country of only 360,000 people. But its large-scale, randomized testing of the coronavirus could have broad ramifications for the rest of the world, as it has found that around half of all people who test positive for the virus are asymptomatic. Iceland also intervened early, aggressively contact-tracing and quarantining suspected coronavirus cases. Contrast these interventionist responses with Sweden - the only Nordic country not led by a woman - where Prime Minister Stefan Lofven refused to impose a lockdown and has kept schools and businesses open. There, the death rate has soared far higher than in most other European countries. Other female heads of state have also made headlines through their tough response to the coronavirus. Prime Minister Silveria Jacobs of Sint Maarten governs a tiny Caribbean island of just 41,000, but her no-nonsense video telling citizens to ""simply stop moving"" for two weeks has gone viral around the world. ""If you do not have the type of bread you like in your house, eat crackers. If you do not have bread, eat cereal. Eat oats,"" she says emphatically. 'Incompetent, science-denialist men' Of course, South Korea's (male) President Moon Jae-in has deservedly received praise for flattening the curve of infections in his country through widespread testing. But many countries led by incompetent, science-denialist men have led to catastrophic coronavirus outbreaks. The epicenter of the pandemic is now the United States, where President Trump initially accused the Democratic party of politicizing the virus as a "" That helped bring about the current emergency of over 25,000 coronavirus deaths and a half-million cases, which continue to mount each day. Similarly, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson dismissed the severity of the public health crisis and refused to introduce restrictions on social gatherings long after other European countries went on lockdown. Before he was hospitalized with Covid-19, he told reporters that the virus would not stop him from shaking hands with hospital patients. And the coronavirus would not have spread throughout the world as swiftly if Chinese President Xi Jinping had not allowed five million people to leave Wuhan before it went on lockdown. More women needed? It's too early to say definitively which leaders will emerge as having taken enough of the right steps to control the spread of coronavirus - and save lives. But the examples above show that a disproportionately large number of leaders who acted early and decisively were women. Yet, on January 1, 2020 only 10 of 152 elected heads of state were women, according the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the United Nations - and men made up 75% of parliamentarians, 73% of managerial decision-makers and 76% of the people in mainstream news media.

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/grandparents-interfere-with-parenting-tips-wellness/index.html,"CNN Raising children can feel like a game of whack-a-mole, dashing catastrophes left and right while trying to figure out if Bach or memory games would be better for their intellectual development. A sage grandparent can be just the emergency rescue you need in your back pocket. Or grandparents can serially throw a wrench in your parenting style. If that just described your predicament, know the problem doesn't only exist within your family: Of more than 2,000 parents polled in a recent survey, nearly 45% reported butting heads with grandparents about their parenting choices, according to a report published Monday by The C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health by Michigan Medicine. ""It's kind of a universal experience,"" said poll co-director Sarah Clark, a research scientist in the department of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. The disagreements were classic: 40% of parents thought the grandparents were too lenient on their grandchildren while 14% said grandparents were too tough. The most common areas of conflict were discipline (57%), food (44%) and television and screen time (36%). A close grandparent-child relationship is good for both parties, said Joshua Coleman, a psychologist in private practice in Oakland, California and author of the forthcoming book "" ""A loving and involved grandparent"" can be good for the children's social and cognitive skills, identity, self-esteem and knowledge of family history, said Coleman, who also a senior fellow with the Council on Contemporary Families. He wasn't involved in the study. Grandparents could also bring to a child's life attributes that their parents might not be able to, intervene in unhealthy dynamics and suggest an ""attitude toward the grandchild that might be more loving, compassionate and forgiving,"" he added. ""For the grandparent, it's a deeply powerful source of meaning and pleasure,"" he said. ""The relationship between a grandparent and grandchild is one of a shared vulnerability and a kind of innocence."" Of course, the coronavirus pandemic has complicated matters when it comes to ""Grandparents can be incredibly influential in kids' lives,"" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an Nonetheless, conflict can arise when a grandparent has different ideas than you about the best way to raise children. During the pandemic, conflicts might have worsened due to stress -- especially if you live in a multigenerational household. If tension festers, a few strategies could help to restore the peace. Empathize Parents and grandparents should assume good intentions of the other's behavior and try to understand their motivations, Coleman recommended. Grandparents may try to compensate for their perceived or actual shortcomings as parents. They might correct you if they're frustrated by you unknowingly repeating their mistakes. The older generation also may have lived in a different time when booster seats weren't required by law, when there were no organic baby food labels and when smart devices didn't exist. Parents are anxious and feeling guilty because they're raising children in a world uncertain in terms of economics, climate change and politics, Coleman said. And parenting advice is ever changing, ""with no shortage of articles on any given day or newscasts that tell you all the things that you could do wrong as a parent."" Higher standards can make parents appear more controlling, and the generational tension can create a breeding ground for conflict. Focus on the important things Figure out which issues are deal breakers that require cohesiveness, Clark said. That your children sit in booster seats on car rides and stop eating sugar by 3 p.m. are of utmost importance -- they could otherwise get hurt or experience negative behavioral changes from processed food. ""Try to get the grandparents to understand (why) these are things we really have to do,"" Clark said. Parents should learn to ""back off a little bit"" on less important matters, Clark added. ""It's good to let grandparents be grandparents."" That your kids stay up later when their grandparents watch them isn't a big deal, Clark said. Discipline isn't either, if the disagreement is over your mother not using the timeout chair exactly as you do. Spanking, on the other hand, might be a deal breaker. Educate and set boundaries Conversations to handle these problems are best had when they arise and ""when people are calm and in a good place,"" Coleman said. Start by sharing the positives the grandparents contribute. The most challenging disagreements can arise from situations that grandparents didn't have to deal with. If grandparents feel that your teens' texting is disrespectful, explain that smartphones are largely how kids communicate. Your kids could also put away their phones when they're around their grandparents. Some parents reported tension over grandparents sharing photos of and information about the children on social media. ""Grandparents may not appreciate the privacy considerations that often inform decisions about what and where to post on a public forum, and should talk with parents about their views on including children in social media posts,"" the report said. Close by asking grandparents to abide by your ideas even if they don't understand or agree. Let your partner handle your in-laws Conflict management is better attempted by the biologically or closer related parent, Coleman said. An in-law intervening doesn't usually go as well, he added, because the grandparents could resent your intervention or rightly or wrongly assume that the other parent doesn't agree with you. They could try to circumvent your authority. Grandparents also would have the most to lose - not seeing their adult children and their grandchildren -- if their own child withdraws from the relationship because they're not respected. What to do when all else fails Four in 10 parents had asked a grandparent to change their behavior. For those who were slow to or ultimately refused to adapt, the disagreements only escalated. If your parents are slow to adjust, know that even when making an effort, ""it's easy to fall back on your old habits, particularly when it's things with kids where you're not really even conscious of what you're doing,"" Clark said. Ask your parents what their reasons were for behaving the same way. If they don't change, you get the final vote, Coleman said -- which can sometimes be estrangement if the conflict climaxes instead of reaching equilibrium. The percentage of parents who limited the amount of time their child saw some grandparents increased in accordance with grandparents' refusal to bend. Parents and grandparents should try their best to work things out, because severing the relationship can be harmful for everyone in terms of feelings of anxiety, loss and stress, Coleman said. How the child makes sense of the separation can be challenging as well. If estrangement is necessary, help your child process it by emphasizing that the shift is because their grandparents aren't respecting your ideas about how you raise her. Tell your kids it doesn't have to be forever, and don't vilify them. ""The love that the grandchild has for the grandparents is a part of them,"" Coleman said. ""And you don't want to taint that with your own issues around the grandparent's behavior. Parents have a responsibility to walk that line pretty carefully.""",Butting heads with your child's grandparents? Here's how to make peace
